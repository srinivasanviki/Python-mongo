Alessa_Josue|Singapore- Singapore|22 February 2017|Halloween Horror Night 2016 in USS|5|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|If you're in Singapore/001 you just have to include this in your itinerary! Since I am living in Singapore/001 I have been to USS several times. This review would be the latest Halloween Horror Night theme. It was a great experience and the crowd is just huge! You have to purchase the express pass and believe me it is worth every penny. You don't want to be queuing all night long. The horror houses are fun and exciting! You have to come with your friends or family. But please do not bring little kids along during the Halloween horror night because it is mainly themed for adults. But if you are going there on a regular day/001 I bet everyone of all ages will just love the experience!
centralvic|Ballarat- Australia|22 February 2017|Good fun day.|4|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Fairly typical Universal (though I've only been to LA as well/001 I must admit) but of course it's fun. We went on a Tuesday and though a lot of the rides got longer and longer lines as the day went on/001 we got on most of them within 10 minutes- the only one was Battlestar Galactica/001 which took 30 minutes/001 even early in the day. We liked Waterworld (it's good no matter where you go!) and the Lights/001 Camera/001 Action/001 and Far Far Away Land (Shrek) was fun. If you like theme parks/001 you'll still like this/001 though I can't imagine doing it for more than a day.
Petros I|None|21 February 2017|Fantastic |5|76B23779C072A94399479A57451B3E65|Magical fantastic amazing like a story !! You can find many themes i strongly reccomend tranformers 3d ride/001 shrek 4d/001 waterworld/001 most for me :)
arieskau|New Delhi- India|21 February 2017|Universal Studios |4|D7DFB753DFFADC8C919DA22A116B9AD7|Do not get into hurry while visiting universal studios. Split Santosa Iceland trip into two days. Best place to capture pictures. Relishing rides and amusement park. Theme I loved was Jurassic park. The rides was awesome. The show was too very good. In case you love rollercoaster type rides than it's best place to relish. Walk around the park will let you move into vintage Hollywood landscapes
neelesh2016|Auckland- New Zealand|21 February 2017|Best place to young family|4|A155AF49E2A26AF78E726C5AEBB6935C|We went on most of the rides and longest waiting time we had was 30 minutes. With a young family we were able to go on so many ride it was great. Kids loved it I would go again.
Monique140968|Perth- Australia|21 February 2017|Great day out|5|9638D066FF8FE2275636FCAA19BB7FB6|My 20 year old daughter and I spent the day here. I have been to Universal in Florida and it is no where as big as there but still great fun. The 2 rollercoasters (Galactica) are fast and well worth it if you like the fast rides. Also the Mummy ride and the Transformer ride are a must!We paid the extra for the express pass and didn't wait more than 5 minutes for anything/001 in fact most of the rides we were able to get on straight away even though it was a Saturday and probably one of the busiest days to go. Well worth a visit.
Emily M|None|21 February 2017|Fun way to spend a day|5|3704852E78E2E5D4852A911C9FBEFD04|This was our first visit to a Universal Studios park/001 and it did not disappoint. There was a variety of rides to suit everyones interests. Our favourite ride was The Mummy! The architecture and decorations around the park were very impressive/001 it looked almost as if we were really in the movies. You will definitely need almost a whole day here if you want to see and do everything. Queueing times for rides were not too bad when we visited/001 usually not having to wait any more than 20 minutes per ride. The exception to this was the very popular Jurassic Park river ride/001 for which we waited about 1.5 hours in the afternoon/001 so maybe try and get to this one early in the day.There were a variety of food outlets and shops around the park.It was very easy to get to the park via the monorail to Sentosa Island. The monorail stop is right next to the park.
krystal l|None|20 February 2017|The mummy is a must|5|76A8285D8F2ED41F99ECDB9987021FAE|Make sure to check the weather before planning a trip here. Go early to avoid heavy crowds. I recommend to go straight to Transformers ride upon entering the park since this ride immediately has long lines
AM-AM-Travellers|London- United Kingdom|20 February 2017|A nice day out whilst in Singapore|4|26345728869F71A8FAAF78D1AF8A5BB7|We only spent a day here and most of it was in universal studios. Very commercial but really fun to experience.Universal Studios was good fun/001 a few good rides small version of the real thing but still something cool to do.Not really a cultural experience but its is something fun to do whilst visiting Singapore
eshendra|Colombo- Sri Lanka|20 February 2017|A fun place for the whole family|5|79CE74EA40AEBF42D0F7F332618DB780|Had a great time/001 it was a fun experience. We enjoyed all the attractions. We bought the tickets on line with the express pass. This is the best option to cut the time spent in ques. Also note the express pass is dynamically priced and can go up in price closer to the day you want to visit. Be prepared to spend the whole day at Universal Studios as you will not have time to see other attractions on Santosa. We used the Satosa express from Vivo City and if you are going on the Santosa express line/001 be prepared for a long queue and if it is a public holiday it can get very crowded.Went on the 26th of December 2016
Meenakshigupta|Gurgaon- Haryana- India|20 February 2017|Reach early and enjoy the rides....|5|7DEC0F22EEA3BE9851FC38C3375A551D|A fun place which has something for everyone. Kids and young adults enjoy the most of the rides. Very thoughtfully designed theme park and well managed facilities. Water Show was amazing and must watch. When you enter the Universal studio/001 take the schedule of events/001 as they have wonderful parades and shows. Mummy ride and Galactic are the best rides. Lost of food options/001 so do not carry your take away food or big bags. Just wear comfortable clothing and try not to carry bags else you will need to deposit in locker while you are on rides. if you are with kids/001 strollers are available on rent. Lot of places to click pictures/001 so enjoy and pose.
Judy G|Glenbrook- Australia|20 February 2017|A fun day to bring out the child within !|4|D489131D68238DA85D4AEE39048EF69D|My sister and I walked across to Sentosa Is to the Universal studios . We both had lots of fun pretending to be kidscagain The stunt show was fantastic .
Pigalle1966|Zug- Switzerland|19 February 2017|Great park with no waiting time!|5|B10AB36C2AF65AEB7F54A461F7A88602|We had a great experience/001 especially as we could do all the rides in one afternoon with basically no waiting time which was great! Even the Transformer Ride (highly recommended) had no waiting
Ashish081089|New Delhi- India|19 February 2017|Few rides  long lines..!!|3|C5FB85B509AFB63834D6DBFDC6FB2F5D|Went on a Friday and the lines were really long/001 ended up buying the fast pass but that is expensive in comparison to the fun out there. The park was small/001 plenty of food available/001 remember to carry water as the drinks are priced really high.I personally did not enjoy it much as most of the rides are more for kids/001 will not be returning.
septis|Madiun- Indonesia|19 February 2017|greatest playground|5|621C0C95B4E9C979E2250C67D59A9EDE|admission tickets to Universal Studios is $ 75 per person. once signed can visit all the existing vehicle. there are a lot of entertainment and rides are cool. performances of some talent disco at every bend in the road. satisfied to ride a roller coaster. hot weather no obstacle for feeling very happy.
amymgoodman|Port Macquarie- Australia|19 February 2017|Universal Studios Singapore|5|92D3F577C80A28DB2C0839EE2B42EB1E|Universal studios is a great day out! I advise to get there just before the park opens and definately get the express pass!! It is so worth it due to the massive waits for most rides.
Sordnaxela|Surrey- United Kingdom|19 February 2017|Best theme park ever!|5|DE44459A99806E4FF719F7B8894E0A28|Such a well made theme park. Our little boy got to meet The Minions and Transformers. There were lots of rides for him to go on too even though he is just 104cm.An amazing day out. Transformers ride was the best
duncan1977|Leeds- United Kingdom|19 February 2017|Worth a visit |4|05A13777AEE61C2DFC8FBC89116F2E89|We went here on a day trip and enjoyed it a lot/001 the only thing we did not like is the queuing/001 on some rides It would say 30 minutes wait so we joined the cue and it ended up being nearly an hour. On some rides it has a "Single Rider" option where you can jump the whole cue if you are wanting to ride the ride without your partner/kids/001 a ride that had a 60 minute wait time I got on it in 5 minutes As you would expect food and drink is quite expensive in the park so bring a pack lunch if you can.For a fee there are lockers where you can store your bags if you want to go on some of the big rides So overall a nice day out
Vejaya M|None|19 February 2017|Entertainment for all ages|5|BFDDAF8ECDE3D7786DECF885A834C0BC|It's an awesome place to have loads of fun. It's suitable for young kids who are probably taller than 120cm. There are kids rides and adult rides too. Weekdays are better as it is less crowded. However if u choose to go on the weekends or holidays/001 I would suggest taking the priority pass. It let's u try the rides faster. It is really worth it.
Shabana S|None|19 February 2017|Awesome!!!|5|782998D5E1D36246E1D716B1CA024285|Me and my husband went in early Feb and luckily it was a scorcher of a day too. We had the best time ever/001 all the rides are so much fun. We got there about 15 minutes before the park opened and there wasn't much rush at the ticket counter (it was Monday) . We brought the single express ticket which means you can use the express line for each ride once (most of the rides do have an express line). The rides we enjoyed the most were the transformers/001 the mummy ride and the Steven Spielberg experience. Because of the express ticket and not many people we did the whole park by 13:00pm/001 we then sat and watched the mels dinettes performance which was great too!! There are many dining options inside and outside the park/001 if you choose to dine outside the park attendants stamp your hand so you can come out and then go back in.
lakshmi p|None|18 February 2017|Universal studios|4|5B94C47847DF69F16491611E0C933A53|This place would be excellent for those who likes "mechanical rides". The waiting time is more than one hour With Normal tickets for each ride .To enjoy all the rides fastrack tickets are must.
outlawwa|Perth- Australia|18 February 2017|Spoilt by Universal Hollywood|4|602DC2235453C583C1FBD05AB0A1ABED|This park was small by the standards we have been to previously. That said it was clean/001 staff were very very friendly and the rides entertaining. Be aware however that most of the rides are for older kids or adults.
Nkocak|Singapore- Singapore|18 February 2017|A Fantastic Day in Universal Studios|5|28F7F2628582685B77D02BA4A9CE0F67|We have spent one entire day in Universal Studios in Singapore and we still haven't done all attractions yet. It is truly a magnificient place to be/001 really amazing/001 all day fun. Rides are great/001 Sesame Street/001 Transformers/001 The Jurassic Park/001 Shrek Movie in Far Far Away/001 Madagaskar and so on/001 so forth. Kids love it and so you do. Definitely buy the express otherwise you can't see anything. Though pricey/001 highly recommended!
Itsmorefuntotravel|None|18 February 2017|Going back to become a child again|5|EB1A9D245804033E4344B7A46E345E93|This is my 2nd time to visit the Universal Studios in Singapore. Every time i come to this place/001 i feel like i am a child again excited and happy of what is to unfold. We were taking a lot of pictures to bring home. We have a grand time with my friend and daughter. The rides were fabulous and so as the many attractions inside the studio. Maybe i didn't hydrate myself or it was just too hot for me/001 i fainted while waiting in line. Fortunately/001 i was given first aide right away and was brought to a place where i can rest. After 1 hour and 30 minutes/001 i went outside again to roam around Universal. The staff were really kind/001 they gave me water and check on my vital signs from time to time while i was recuperating. Thank you to the staff of Universal Studios.
Filraz A|None|18 February 2017|Amazing Experience!|4|0C5CD0CDC23F37284D1E2D548AE32299|Simply amazing... Specially the Galactica.. Revenge of the Mummy... And the Transformers.....A must go place in Singapore!
Soumenpal73|Kolkata (Calcutta)- India|18 February 2017|Family tour|4|D5AB1BA39440C4732E45F9337AD101F8|Sentosa trip is all any child would want to see. It is a one stop place for enjoyment to kids. U have it all here- from games to rides to Madame Tussaud's! An entertainer for the full family!
bhatianimisha002|Mumbai (Bombay)- India|17 February 2017|Must visit|5|C52ECA8E5315F090013A45163711F600|If you are in Singapore this place is must visit. This place is located in Sentosa island. It has many attractions/001 shows and rides. Check timings for shows and character meet. I would suggest buying tickets online to get some discount. Plan your visit in advance.
Angelalizhao|Wellington- New Zealand|17 February 2017|Good place for family with bigger kids|4|05C358E4342477AE60F838FDB0A72183|I like here except the long long long queues. I don't think it is suitable for young kids under 5. Our 3 year old daughter almost missed all the fun due to the age and height. Our 7 & 9 year old sons love here regardless the hot weather and long queues. The most exciting activity is Transformer but we queued one turn for 1.5 hours!! I felt I was paying money to queue....... Listen to others' suggestions: get express pass if you can afford otherwise you would fell exhausted after queuing a whole day.
leyzlie|None|17 February 2017|Definitely entertaining!|5|6B81461CD777C89FEB1C48E137C799BE|It is much better to visit Universal Studios Singapore during weekdays to avoid hour length wait to their infamous rides. If you don't have any choice but to go on weekends or holidays/001 skip first the rides cause it will consume most of your time but hang around the place for every photo opt or check out the schedule for the appearance of many USS characters and other attractions (Waterworld). Try to get back late in the afternoon for the rides to have shorter cue for the rides. (Though it's your choice to have this option cause what if the cue for the rides was still long.) It is much better to visit USS for the whole day. All rides are enjoyable/001 facades are amazing and picture friendly. Food choices for snacks and lunch are very limited and expensive though/001 but fulfilling.
babaidey|Jamshedpur|16 February 2017|amusement park|5|CF39D78F143B6357CD9E88834BA783F8|a place for all category of people/001 so many attraction/001 starting from all 3d adventures/001 mummy ride/001 transformer etc. Awesome place/001 u will not realize when ur day will end. food and water is expensive/001 still a place worth to visit
Simon D|Montrose- United Kingdom|16 February 2017|Good and average|3|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|During our holiday to Singapore in September 2016 we made a visit to the Universal Studios on Sentosa Island.To get there we took the MRT to the Harbour front/001 walked through the mall and collected our tickets before boarding the express monorail to Sentosa. The theme park itself felt a little smaller than other theme parks we had visited/001 including Universal in Orlando but the place is very well laid out.The queues were a little long and we did take the fast pass options/001 some of the rides were great the Battlestar Galactica/001 Jurassic Park and Mummy rides were particularly fun. We didn't eat a meal at the park as we thought it was a little pricey. Overall this is a good place to visit but with restricted park size it doesn't quite live up to the Orlando sister parks.
Piyush G|New Delhi- India|16 February 2017|superb is the word....must visit for families|4|1F2177067CFC815D22CC9230C86AAA18|superb is the word....must visit for families. lots of good rides and you enjoy in each of the ride. Most popular is Transformers ride in Universal studio. When you buy ticket they encourage you to buy combo tkt which includes Sentosa island as well however they have not upgraded sentosa for more than a decade so that's a boring place. Only Universal studio is good to visit.
squeezageeza|None|16 February 2017|Good attractions bad service|2|352E1E37092AF29D7A62C80E5B20417E|Spent a day here and whilst the attractions are food the customer service is very poor. Everyone working here seems very young. My partner had a water damaged phone caused by one of the attractions and no one was interested on trying to help. 2 rides broke down on our day and after lining up for 40 mins when we decided to leave asked if we could have a fast pass when the attraction opens again we were told "people were there longer then you". Very dissapointing.
Claire H|Perth- Australia|16 February 2017|Thrill seeking fun|5|0FFE8B9C32DF01CE853F78A47290A015|Hubby and I don't do big rides/001 he also doesn't care much for heights. I'm saying this because while we are both/001 let's face it/001 whimps but we still had a great time. It is worth getting a fast pass when you buy a ticket. We went mid week and the lines were still hours long. Some more simple rides and attractions had quick lines. The Jurassic rapids were so much fun (which is possibly why the line was over an hour long) the high flyer was also great and had no line.There was plenty of food available inside so don't feel the need to bring a lunch. Also/001 pack light/001 the more things you bring with you the more time you'll spend in the lines for the lockers at the start of rides. We had breakfast at a pancake place near the entrance before we went in/001 and spent a total of about 6 hours inside. Which was enough time to cover everything we wanted to do. Had we have wanted to do the big thrilling rides we would have been short on time. Those lines were over an hour each. I will 100% be coming back here. It was a great day out.
huifen2017|Makassar- Indonesia|16 February 2017|My Second Time|5|D26A44368F50BAD62469AEE223798D11|Its my second time went there. But this time I bought the ticket with Universal Express that really saving time and skip the very long queue. Price is much higher of course but if you want to enjoy more in this place i suggest you to buy and add universal express. It is worth it!
Sep3ani|Denpasar- Indonesia|16 February 2017|Great Place to Go!!|4|A44FCE493889857F2AB7CF7213736E70|I went Universal Studio Singapore last week with my friend. It was amazing. I try almost all of the studio. They are open from 10 am - 7 pm. Sesame street on New York area/001 Transformer ( there is a roller coaster/001 I try it and it the best roller coaster I ever try)/001/001 mummy (roller coaster in the dark)/001 jurassic park ( rafting)/001 and many things you can do there. Entrance fee is SGD $73 per person/001/001 you need to pay extra SGD $30 if you don't want to queue.
Travel_m0re77|Auckland Region- New Zealand|16 February 2017|Small but fun|4|F6E35AC285A44341EED0D42423FCA152|The park itself is quite small but it was fun. We had free tickets to get in which was good as it is normally quite expensive. We purchased a one off express pass for S$50 each which gave us one express entry per ride. It was well worth it as some of the rides had wait times of 40+ mins which to be fair isn't unreasonable for a theme park. But with it being so hot and with a young child it was better to jump to the front. The park is very clean. It was very crowed with tourists (to be expected).
Audreeadjel|None|16 February 2017|Go there on Saturday for Hollywood Parade|5|DC0305ABD54797BA6A32E2CEFC55F0F8|from Sleepy kiwi we traveled by bus to Vivo City and train to USS at 8am. Please note on Vivo city there is a shuttle on bus area going to USS for a flat fare SGD1. did not see it that's why I have take the train and take the escalator up to 3rd floor. We arrived early. We eat at Slappy pancakes since it will open at 10am/001 going in is fast and organized. There isnt a lot of people so we are not rushing in to go in line. in fact the longest waiting time we had is 20 mins which is the Transformer ride. HIGHLY recommended to ride. No need for express pass though there is still few people purchase it. it was a really hot day so we didnt bother to going in and out to buy some food outside to save some money. The food we purchased range SGD10-15 for a regular burger meal. Milkshake is SGD7/001 ice cream SGD4. for souvenir I find it too pricey when converting since I came from Manila on ROE is 1PHP=35SGD just imagine it. The Hollywood parade start at 3pm very great show. I must also commend BETTY BOOP mascot is very nice.. Taking pictures with mascot are everywhere you must only ques. There will be rides that you will get/001 just in case you dont have raincoat or anything/001 there is drying Capsule for SGD5. since we almost go around USS two times we were too tired to wait for the fireworks :(/001 we go home at 6PM and queing on train takes time like 30 mins.
Thanusha P|None|15 February 2017|A great trip|5|6771E6617BD9A0818DF4F31E16F5669D|The amusement park was amazing. The queues were long for the rides but the transformers ride was fantastic/001 well worth the wait. Overall a fantastic place to visit
Romesh J|None|15 February 2017|Great place with even greater queues..|4|6010CE946FD311115C442E2FAC9D626D|Visited the theme park with my wife and two kids aged 8 and 12. Purchased the standard tickets for about USD 40 pp. Really enjoyed the rides especially the duelling "battle star galactica" ride/001 which is not for the faint hearted and the Egyptian section which featured an indoor ride with all sorts of Egyptian monsters to keep us company. The 3D "Transformers" ride was also truly enjoyable. The kids also fully enjoyed the 3D movie at Never Never Land. My main grouse however was the very long waiting time for each and every ride. We were only able to complete 5-6 rides during the whole day and each ride had a waiting time of 1 hour or more. So I strongly recommend new visitors especially those with families and/or have just one day to visit/001 to pay extra and buy the fast track tickets. Else you are in for a long wait and risk get your blood pressure up (as I did) by fuming silently at those with fast track tickets sauntering in while you are in the queue for hours...
Anthony M|Al Khobar- Saudi Arabia|15 February 2017|feels good to be a kid again|3|C58AA57BD8F37ADBAE28C36656B30D22|Visiting Universal Studios unleashes the child on everyone... Its comparatively smaller as compared to US/LA and Japan so crowds tend to cluster on popular rides so its advisable to top on for the VIP pass if you can afford it... This allows you to maximize and enjoy all the major rides during the day
Tarekz8|Dubai- United Arab Emirates|15 February 2017|Everything hurts!!!|5|7598963A000AB042E1D0E34DF1EBB159|But in a good way. After 7 hours and a total of 10km covered over the course of the day; the kids saw/001 did and ate everything and they had a blast doing it.The park needs a full day and don't be cheap/001 buy the express passes otherwise you will spend the entire day waiting in line.Cylon/001 Transformers and the Shrek 4D were great brilliant fun. The Jurassic Park ride was not a favourite. You simply got soaked for the sake of it. It was as if the inventors ran out of ideas and figured getting people wet was a sufficient substitute for a lack of imagination. It is an expensive day out the entire family thoroughly enjoyed themselves.
Orwin L|None|15 February 2017|a must go attraction in singapore|5|76E30B8DD128266B57E9A7034C6D87A5|best for roller coaster lovers & adventure loving people. good for freinds & family outing.kids will love this place !! Its very crowded during public holidays & vacations.Best time to visit is weekdays. you can purchase xpress tickets to beat the queue.
Mickel49|Sydney- Australia|15 February 2017|Holidays|4|F78BEF17BD23763F083F556EF3336602|Went to Universal Studio back in 2013 by myself and loved it/001 this time we went as a family and we had a great time till mid afternoon when it started to rain.There is not much to do when it rains as all rides outside stops and only the ones inside work and get very busy.Shops get over crowded and the Main Street parade was not on as there is not much cover after you leave Main Street.
rachel t|None|15 February 2017|One of the best days at Singapore |5|F3A44CF703522DB44AFE9E170033533D|Universal Studios/001 at the offset I thought it was a place for kids/001 with just rides and stuff. But man/001 it was awesome. It has multiple themes/001 rides/001 information and so much more that every grown up becomes a kid for a while. Worst a visit.
Faiza L|Karachi- Pakistan|14 February 2017|Boring and Too Kidish! |2|53BD2846AE0CDDE19581F652A95EE5A0|I didn't enjoy it much! The activities are for kids/001 literally! It's better to spend time exploring Singapore then wasting time here!!! There is actually only one ride that could be considered by grown ups! The access is easy with metros and monorail!
abdulrahman542|Najran|14 February 2017|Must See 2nd in Asia|4|8D7457BD66F99B96A58798C35D5A564F|It's amazing themed park you don't have time to wait you will have continuous enjoyment with many characters insideYou will have plenty of photo you need big memory
Andrew H|Singapore- Singapore|14 February 2017|Nice outing in the Tropics|5|E0FA269A9EE6890658E2C9348C9F6244|Nice to see Universal Studios has improved on its rides and amenities. Food variety is also good n don't forget to keep yourselves hydrated as it can get very hot and sunny. So those SPFs will also be good for everyone..
bruce r|bangkok|14 February 2017|Fantastic rides  needs more soul|4|E05D4208B5161B4A9AF01878D71F30AD|As a first time US visitor I had expected more soul and organic feel of the movie setting. Though the rides are fantastic/001 we enjoyed a number of rides including Transformer/001 Sesame Street/001 and Madagascar. However/001 more rides would be a boon to USS.
283umeshp|Mumbai|14 February 2017|Loved the entire experience|5|F20DA9E2571F1E33245704F1ACA9A32A|If you are a theme park lover/001 this is definitely a must visit. Some of the attractions that i loved were the mummy returns ride ( is quite scary )/001 steven speilbergs lights camera action is cool/001 cool characters like the minions and Marlyn Monroe walk around the park for picture opportunities/001 there are lockers available next to some rides so u can store your handbags while you go go for the ride/001 the lockers are free for sometime/001 which is usually enough for you to go on some rides and back.also fast or express passes are possible to cut the waiting time in queues/001 a good tip is to start from the end of the park working up to the fromt as most people usually follow the rides as they come/001 it is pissble to finish all important attractions in 1 day
hsanchezcpa|Riyadh- Saudi Arabia|14 February 2017|A place to remember|5|0A2A3B52838285E710D1BD6D96732E99|It was Christmas season when I visited this fairy tale and happy theme park. It is somehow a dream come true. I enjoy a lot though you really need to fall in a long Que. After all/001 it is worth the wait. I super enjoyed the Christmas village! Bring you kids also your friend to remind them their Childhood. Cheers!
CheshireSupermum|cheshire|14 February 2017|Cheshiresupermum |4|FA27C78244EE7DD519F6C4A2C15DF738|Spent day here yesterday. Mini version of the one in Florida. Good day out little if any queues which was fab. I'm the one who sits on bench while they do roller coasters but hardly settled on bench and they'd been on. Tame rides are very tame so suitable for little ones.
Casey V|Shenyang- China|14 February 2017|Great day out!|5|7474AF5E08369D47D7C0EE80D64F8A85|Made the trip from JB and it didn't disappoint! You can get tickets for 5 RM to cross the causeway on the KTM trains from JB Sentral to Woodlands and back. The taxi from Woodlands to USS was about $24/001 but well worth it considering all the different buses and trains we would have had to take/001 and would have been almost $20 for 2 people. We visited during the tail-end of Chinese New Years/001 but was pleasantly surprised at the short wait times. On a few rides we too the single riders lane and got put on the same ride anyways. The Mummy Returns was fantastic/001 we did Transformers twice/001 and the Jurassic Park waterride soaked us :)Will be returning with my wife/001 and look forward to the next trip!
AhSiong25|S'pore|14 February 2017|Long queue to enter  but queues for rides managable|4|8399EBE72B8B10BD650BD1DD77D86BBF|Were excited to bring my boy to the theme park during our staycation at Hard Rock hotel last week. When we were there at 10am/001 there were hundreds of people queuing up to enter the park. Queue was orderly.Inside the park/001 the time taken to queue for rides were manageable. Not as bad as I would have expected. Overall a good experience for us and our boy.
aybee r|None|13 February 2017|a themed park|4|7B0E3BB60229D4D15059B700BD940C12|Universal Studio Sg is a typical themed park with rides and attractions. The only difference is the character in every stop. It is still for kids and adults too
tracyjocye1991|Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia|13 February 2017|Universal Studios - Singapore|4|B26BF4BAF853FBF176A2BF4E030FE938|Spend whole day at Universal Studios. This is my third time to Universal Studio Singapore. Compare to other countries Universal Studios/001 Singapore's Universal are small. However/001 we still enjoy it so much. We went there Chinese New Year Eve and there are many people queuing. Please make sure that you reach USS before 10am to avoid long queue. When entering USS/001 straight go to Transformer Ride because most of the people will go for that rides.
Kumaran M|None|12 February 2017|Kids loved it!|5|2A50598ED4572D15D4556ADA54AF3810|Spent a full day at Universal studios. Went in January and it was busy yet able to go on all the rides we wanted to. The longest waiting time was 40min which I was expecting to be much longer. The kids loved the park and we have beautiful memories of it. A must when in Singapore with the family.
Asanka M|Colombo- Sri Lanka|12 February 2017|Thrill ans fun.|5|9175F804BAC85250D927A986EBDBB07B|Its perfect place to experience thrill ans fun. Go on weekday so that u don't face a crowded park and can cover most things in one day. We buy the express ticket. It's S$ 50 & entrance ticket price is S$ 70. If u can buy express ticket u can cover lot of areas. See the dramas. specially water world function. Foods are expensive at inside. Must try attractions rides are - Transformers - Mummy .HUMAN or CYLON.
Ms_Michaela|Toronto- Canada|12 February 2017|Go during weekdays|3|DFC854D54681FC0978F8770BEE4B1C9D|We were there during the new year holidays and it was so crowded. The top attractions have 1-2 waiting lines even in the morning. Went there to check the place out/001 probably will not return the next time.
Minoli W|Mahara- Kadawatha- Sri Lanka|12 February 2017|Fun time for everyone|4|E3423865673056348CB396E110AEDE7C|This place has something for everyone. From the Kingdom Far Far Away for the little kids to Sci Fi section for adults (who are kids at heart)/001 everyone can enjoy something here. You would need at least one full day to fully appreciate everything. The food is more expensive than outside/001 which is natural in a theme park. It was interesting how different restaurants had a menu that catered to the theme. If you are South Asian and looking for rice/001 Ancient Egypt is your best bet.Make sure you pick up a map from the entrance/001 and travel in an anti-clockwise manner. Remember to bring a lot of water/001 and prepare to walk A LOT.It would save you plenty of time if you purchase the express tickets. Yes/001 they are more expensive than the regular ones. But definitely worth it/001 considering how the queues can last over three hours.
PillaiPramod|Mumbai (Bombay)- India|11 February 2017|Wonderful Time at Universal Studio|5|041CDE6E138C32DB934E58977B044B90|Great Experience. If you Kids with you/001 one place that you can't miss.If You dont Have Kids with You/001 still a place that you can't afford to miss.The Revenge of the Mummy ride was awesome.
vandylim|Singapore|11 February 2017|Horrible customer service!|1|4A6FAA4FC6B96054CA1658F7F66C09B8|Visited USS on 10th Feb/001 I was queuing with my 3 years at the children roller coaster 'enchanted airways'. I have the annual pass and was queueing at the express lane.We waited for 3 rounds of non express queue and when a customer behind me and I tried to ask why is our express side is not moving/001 the staff just turn their back on us and ignore us without any explanation. That guy is wearing spectacles and middle age and the lady assisting is a short hair girl. If I get their name I will write in to the management to feedback!Disappointed and ugly to receive such treatment from USS. Never knew their staff is been train to treat their customer in such ways!
BongKarno|Philippines|11 February 2017|Great attractions for all!|5|22F62FF4F4A89F8C1A769EEEF510A6E8|As an adrenaline junkie like myself/001 the 2 things that I will never forget and will try again when I go back are:1. The Mummy - I did not expect this one to be very thrilling! I thought it would just be a boring ride. But jeezus I was blown away! It's like riding a roller coaster in total darkness! Unbelievably fun!2. Battlestar Galactica - This is the resident roller coaster of Universal Studios Singapore. It's a roller coaster with double the fun! This coaster has 2 rides. The concept is on the name itself/001 Battlestar Galactica. Basically it's like a fight with humans and aliens. One coaster is where you ride as the humans. A basic roller coaster ride. But the other one for me is way more fun: the aliens' side! On this other coaster/001 your feet are hanging! Imagine that! OMG my soul separated from my body during the first drop! I can't overstate enough how fun that ride was!But my most useful tip is this: buy express passes! Again/001 BUY EXPRESS PASSES!!! It's the purchase that I never regretted! It will save you a TON of time! Normal tickets will cost you AN HOUR in line waiting for your turn. But when you use express pass/001 it will literally take you a minute to get to the ride. There's a different line for normal tickets and for express passes. You can see the envy from the eyes of the people who endured long lines waiting. While you just walked in but you get to ride first.
Antonio A|None|10 February 2017|My favorite universal! |5|4382A547687C492AF310684F57015251|Shreks castle/001 the mummy/001 Elmo in space/001 Charlie Chaplin/001 and even dinosaurs?! This is the best place ever!!!!!!!!
FJ03|None|10 February 2017|Fun day out |5|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|My husband and I spent the day here. Now I must mention my husband is an adrenaline junkie /001 whilst I would say I'm the opposite . Thus I felt that the theme park catered to the both of us. Getting here is fairly easy and everything is sign posted . We took the monorail which was fast but packed . I would recommend getting here early and possibly purchasing the fast track tickets for the additional cost . As the queues were very long when we went and for example the transformers ride we waited almost two hours to get in. It was also a very hot and humid day .The studios I mentioned catered to all ages I feel. I've not been to the Florida theme park so can only base my opinion on Singapore . But they have shows /001 roller coasters /001 boat rider /001 souvenir shops and quite a few food outlets on site . There are different themed sections/001 such as the mummy/001 Jurassic park /001 shrek/001 transformers etc and all have there different rides and shows taking place .There are times where you may need to use the lockers as certain rides require no personal belongings. Our personal favourite ride was the water boat ride at Jurassic park. You do get slightly wet but honestly it was a breath of fresh air as we went on a very hot and humid day (humidity was at 98%). Shrek 4D was also good fun and my husband enjoyed this with the chairs moving and splashes of water on the face . The water world show was excellent and the stunts and actors had the audience fully engaged . Staff I found to be lovely honestly /001 they were so helpful and the service was very good. There were a couple times when some of the rides were delayed or experiencing technical problems but apart from that it is a great fun day out for all ages . And the theme park closes at 7pm .
vidhu s|Bengaluru- India|9 February 2017|#1 in Singapore! Here are a few tips!|5|856D88909F9A1746A88AB7D27679DC5F|I was in Singapore on a family trip of 6 people. My parents and aunt are all above 60 while one of my cousins (24) doesn't like rides. That left me with just two of us who wanted to go to USS but I wasn't sure it justified taking all of them together and that too for an entry ticket priced at $75 each! However/001 it turned out to be the best day we spent in Singapore. One/001 it offers rides and entertainment for people of all the ages. My parents sat in ALL the rides! (I was surprised). Here are the highlights:1. The best ever stage show that I had ever seen (WATERWORLD).2. Best 4D show/ride ever. (TRANSFORMERS)3. Lights/001 Camera and Action.4. Great rides for adventure freaks.Here are some tips for all:TIP 1: try to visit it on a weekday. Although the queues that we found were on an average only 20%-30% occupied (of the capacity)/001 we still ended up waiting for up to 30 minutes in a few rides.TIP 2: it is arranged in a circular layout. As soon as you enter it/001 look for where the crowd seems to be heading. Start walking in the opposite direction! ;)TIP 3: Single passengers have a separate queue. If you don't have a condition to sit together on a ride/001 it will save at least 70% of your time.TIP 4: Buy your tickets through an agent in Singapore. I got my tickets at a discount of $20 per person.TIP 5: This was the only attraction I found which gives discounted tickets for the elderly (60+) irrespective of their nationality. Tickets for my parents costed me $36 each.TIP 5: Food is very expensive inside. If you don't wanna spend that much/001 try getting something with you. (Before entering USS you will also find a few joints like McDonald's).
Alj0hn|Mandaluyong- Philippines|9 February 2017|Happy Solo traveller|5|75A09D614B592227EE6A2FC17645C5C4|I enjoyed my trip to Universal Studios on Singapore Independence day. It is somewhat smaller than I expected but it is still okay. I enjoyed the rides especially the ones for kids. Did Not try any thrilling ride cause I'm afraid of them. My favorite attraction is The Transformers and Shrek/001 I've tried them twice.I did not try the food/001 I ate at Malaysian food street outside USS and their Laksa soup is really good. Advantage for solo traveller is that I don't have to fall in line for long cause they have a single rider queue. IF not because of that I might've hated my trip because there were a loooot of people that day. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely go back.
Carole H|St. Ives- Australia|9 February 2017|Rides for every age|5|B29B832A05C9EC932457D0486CFA7BD9|Jump the line by riding solo. Great food. Plenty of places to sit. Designated smoking areas. A place for everyone.

shruti2017|Hyderabad- India|8 February 2017|Must Do if your in Singapore !|4|AAE15C433E1B8CDBB590B1C402B828BE|We spent one full day at the Universal Studios and needless to say it was worth it. We started off early and we were there before the gates opened at 10 am but even then we greeted by a huge queue when we reached there. I read a lot of reviews before we went there to prioritize the rides /001 but so did everyone else !!! So we spent 2 hours in the queue for a 4 min ride which was supposed to be the star attraction - Transformers. Then we decided to do our own thing which worked out better because we were able to cover the next shows of waterworld and some of the kids rides which my 6 year old daughter absolutely loved .... Sesame Street/001 Madagascar/001 Shrek 4D. By evening a lot of the crowd had dwindled and its a good thing that the timings are now extended because we were able to cover almost everything that we wanted to. We were even able to take a second shot at Transformers without any waiting time and it was soo much fun !!
Bharat S|None|8 February 2017|an experience for the kids and the elderly alike!|5|876AF4C67676E2E502C8A315BDB5DC8D|A day is enough to cover up this entire attraction/001 and still have some time to spend something extra at the universal stores :Dtook a privilege pass/001 so didnt have to stand in otherwise long queues. all the rides for comfortably covered. the roller coasters are a must. the jurassic park and the mummy returns rides were the best ones!
Wasantha D|Dubai- United Arab Emirates|8 February 2017|Day to remember.....|4|133DC9588F832B8F4962F97584739E27|Sentosa Island is a place to be with your family with so many attractions which you will not tired of it was awesome all day experience attractions are nothing to compare with. My children loved universal studio and I loved it too/001 do not miss out live shows.
tamonnx|Thailand|7 February 2017|Review |4|4D756057E0414ED97AB9F0255523B68B|I have been to Singapore for studied a summer course. Surely/001 if you go to Singapore/001 you have to go to Universal Studios. I went there by sentosa express and got off at Waterfront Station. I bought universal express tickets which 1 ticket can use for 1 plaything. There are 7 zones which is Hollywood/001 New York/001 Sci-Fi City/001 Ancient Egypt/001 Lost World/001 Far Far Away and Madagascar. My favorite plaything is "transformers" because it's very exciting. I wanted to play battlestar garactica so much but it's closed for renovation. In the Universal studios have a lot of food that you can choose such as hamburgers/001 onion rings/001etc. I really suggest you to go to 'Universal Studios.'
Andrada I|None|6 February 2017|Fun all he day|4|0AAFD1A1D98F514D0F00FAF5E21E983A|+a lot of attractions+good organized-they have some bugs in Egypt the carousel was broken and was not working for few hours.
TheHumbleTourist|Malaysia|6 February 2017|Small and Expensive|3|54E2E979CE3F4C7F93687A904E8DCBD2|Bad:The place was extremely crowded when I visited weeks ago. Queue was as long as 2 hours for a ride of 15 minutes or so. The park map wasn't big. Good:The performances were up to standard. The Transfer ride is just fantastic! The waterworld stunts were amazing!Improve:Maybe I should give it another try on weekdays in my next visit. Or to purchase the express ticket.
KarmaTempa|Gangtok|6 February 2017|Huge place and lots of fun|5|332A71CF1E2FA5F899B7B7E7C26F081F|Universal Studios is a huge place with lots to experience/001and one should reach early to be able to try and see all that is there.It is not possible to get on all the rides as the waiting line is extremely long everywhere/001so if you have a list of certain things you want to see or ride then its better as a lot of time is wasted standing in the queues and it gets tiring as the place is as mentioned huge and lots to see.Enjoyed the water world and the transformers show.A great experience but most definitely fun for kids and adults alike.
PPR P|Shanghai |6 February 2017|Fun times!|5|8DD4943B366EC903731D5679639DBF64|Great park/001 clean and organized! Absolutely go early and get the express pass! Minimal rides for teens/001 but with the express pass they can repeat often. Good food/001 one day experience with a lot to do outside of the park as well.
Steve C|Crawley- United Kingdom|6 February 2017|Great day out|5|3E37BEF1B6C060AA04AE88BD96A0C99A|This was a really nice theme park. I've visited theme parks all over the world but this one really impressed me. It's immaculately clean and not over expensive and had a good range of rides with a decent queue system unlike some other theme parks I could name.
Yogesh0304|Pune- India|5 February 2017|Nice place for family|4|537BF18F0408F20834FE5B1DB1A9018D|Universal studios in Singapore is a theme park on Sentosa island. Take online ticket. One can reach there by MRT then by shuttle or Sentosa express or by walk. Less frequency of Sentosa Express makes it inefficient. So better take a walk or shuttle bus from Vivo city. Most of the rides in Universal studio are suitable for family and are mild/001 except Revenge of the Mummy and Battlestar Galactica gray track. Don't miss transformer 3D battle. Single rider entry saves queue time. Overall Universal studios is a fun day for a family with young children.
gauravjalan|New Delhi- Delhi- India|5 February 2017|Best in Singapore|5|E547E50A9CF6B2BC7B4FB48F4CE2A540|This is the must visit place in Singapore.The Place is an amusement park/001Like Disneyland..It has more then 3 roller coasters/001& nice restaurants to dine.You need a complete day to spend time here.Universal studios is at Sentosa Island.If you go by Sentosa Express Train/001 then its the first station from singapore.Its a dream land for kids/001/001and if you are in singapore/001 then you should not miss it.Credit Card is accepted everywhere inside the Universal Studios.Avoid going in Rainy Day because most of the rides are closed on rainy day.Also Avoid weekends/001 to avoid long Ques in rides.
Peter B|Shepparton|5 February 2017|Not great for small kids and very expensive.|3|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Many of the rides had height and age limits and prevented our younger children from access. We visited on a normal weekday in the late afternoon and the rides had anticipated wait times in excess of an hour. With the few hours we had planned to stay we would be lucky if we got to ride 3 attractions. It appears that this is normal as the queues were designed to hold hundreds of people with in queue entertainment. The rides we did experience were very well done and the park was very clean. It was extremely hot on the day of our visit and some of the queues were very uncomfortable even with the fans. We got very poor value for our money and they should offer half day tickets and much cheaper prices for young kids.
ila a|None|4 February 2017|Not that good. Few rides  long lines.|2|1B6335EF919F96974DE2B4D82A219B5B|Universal Studio in singapore is nothing as compared to that in the US and it is super crowded and noisy. Long lines (you can get a express pass to avoid them for 50$) and 50% of the rides only for kids.Only 3 - 4 good rides are there transformer and Galactica.we regretted spending one full day out of the 6 total days we had in Singapore. Better things to were Jurong/001 Sky deck ride /001 Area around Marina Sands bay/001 Clark quay/001 exploring super awesome food /001 Night show at gardens by the bay/001 sea world.
BuckeyeAndy|Spokane- United States|4 February 2017|Enjoyed even on a rainy day|4|792492CBA0AB9E40F990A9C1DF0CDBA8|On a rainy day in October/001 we decided to go to Universal Studios Singapore. We still managed to have an enjoyable day for the most part/001 as Universal Studios did a pretty good job trying to keep rides running when possible during rain breaks or light rain. Also/001 many of the rides are also indoors (like Transformers and the Mummy) so you can still do things even in the rain. The one bonus of the rain was that some rides had shorter breaks than usual (especially after they would stop and re-start after rain storms). Although good weather would have made it more enjoyable/001 we were glad to still have a fun day even with all the rain.
yssunil|Singapore- Singapore|4 February 2017|Queueing is the way of life |3|3D2D97CD0339A8F50AA150027BC7FDC5|Straight to the point- weekends are crazy rush. Some staff have told me that Wed or Thu is a bit better but the pain of queueing will remain.- if you are a tourist I would advise to buy an express ticket else you will repent to having paid the ticket price and yet not experiencing half the rides.- don't miss the waterworld show. Also don't bother to go and queue early. It's a large seating space and you will get a good seat.- pick up the event timing sheets. Some shows are worth to visit.- hidden gem is the Guinness record of maximum lights inside an enclosed space within the Hollywood area. Check the picture attached. - No food allowed inside. Don't carry any else you will have to unnecessarily rent a locker to store your stuff
nishantsatyamm|Bengaluru- India|4 February 2017|Awesome place to have multi- varied rides but Express pass is a must|5|45737EEF8122DB8C5619DAAF35911BD6|Galactica/001 Mummy/001 Transformers ride are the usp of the place/001 rest others are around average. An express is a must otherwise you can have to wait for around hours for few of the rides.
Jason C|None|4 February 2017|Awesome little theme park|4|551E89A259A684130D0E6F935155757C|It not the biggest theme park in the world but it was pretty awesome for a afternoon out. Would recommend heading down to Palawan Beach afterwards for dinner and drinks.
thehopster|Singapore- Singapore|4 February 2017|Its all about the timing|4|47FF90DDA4F7D3DD9C6FC9DBE3ACAB48|We arrived at 10am and left at 8.30pm/001 so that says something!I suggest arriving around 930am so as to be one of the first in and plan the things you want to tick off first as by 11am+ the lines might start backing up. There is surprisingly a lot to do. At first glance you think it might be small/001 but it is quite large and the space is very well utilised. Lots of different themes and the kids will love it. There is also enough for the parents. Food was not the best (at least in the American diner we went to) and it is really overpriced. Suggest you head out of the park walk 2 mins into other parts of Resorts World to have a better dining experience. Make sure to get a stamp on the way out to save the grief re-entering the park. We found that come 5pm or so the park clears out and all of a sudden it takes all of 5 mins to get on a ride. I spent the next couple of hours taking advantage of checking out all the rides as many times as I could.Bottom line - Great day out and well worth the visit.
Prittravel1|Singapore- Singapore|3 February 2017|Awesome experience|5|109427F42560CEB23953AD7C465EAD4C|We ultimately ended up buying annual pass to USS. The rides are awesome and thrilling. Best rides are cylone/001 transformer/001 galactica and mummy. Usually the queue is long and might take time to take ride on any given weekend. But the trick is to keep thrilling rides until late afternoon when the crowd starts to thin down and disperse. Till then enjoy regular shows/001 madagascar/001 shrek/001 jurassic park.
Lauren P|None|3 February 2017|Great for those who love the movies!|4|A58F34C1E12B7C7AF718C511D479201C|I really enjoyed geeking out over the movies and the transformers ride was insanely good!If you buy a ticket with an optional transfer to the park I would recommend just making your own way there. They pick you up at 8:30am when the park doesn't open till 10am as they stop lots to pick people up and just sit for a while in a car park. Better to get a bit longer sleep and just go there directly. Some of the movies/themes are a bit outdated now like battlestar galactica and waterworld.
harshit s|Mumbai (Bombay)- India|3 February 2017|A nice place to be  a must visit in singapore|4|48884371927A8C5BA843779C72AA92EE|This is one place you want to be when in Singapore/001 some of the rides are just amazing (Battlestar Galactica - Cylon/001 Transformers etc.)
Solomon L|None|3 February 2017|The better Disneyland!|5|747FDFB38BCB65355B6301B04E7CF329|Filled with roller coasters/001 shows/001 shops and more/001 I absolutely love Universal Studios. My personal favourites from my last visit includes Spielberg's Lights Camera Action/001 the Guinness World Record Lights display/001 and the Transformers Ride (name). Starting with Spielberg's Lights Camera Action show/001 I love the way they compress the complex process of movie special effects into ten minutes. From the small details such as the sound of rain tapping at the side/001 to the large fiery explosion engulfing the set/001 the ten minute spectacle is certainly worth watching for anyone who has watched a movie/001 just for an idea of how it's done. Then the lights display.
Anon Z|None|2 February 2017|Mind blown|5|22B6B90693062146573A4DC3F19CE4E5|This has to be one of the best fun parks I've ever seen. There are all sorts of events and activities from some of the most iconic movies from universal studios. You'll be amazed how well planned this is.

GETTING THERE:* We took a cab to Sentosa Island on our first day/001 While chatting with the cab driver/001 he used the phrase "everything is money my friend" which I experienced firsthand. From your research you might already arrived at a conclusion that getting inside sentosa involves an entry fee either through Sentosa Express (SGD4)/001 taxi (SGD2-6/001 based on time of entry) or own car. But there is another option for people to enter Sentosa Island without paying anything. Yeah/001 you guessed it right/001 its the SENTOSA BOARDWALK. Situated at Level 1 of Vivo City mall/001 this 500m boardwalk take you to Sentosa Island free of charge and hey/001 you don't have to walk. Just take the travelator and enjoy the scenery en route. The boardwalk is free of cost upto 31st Dec'17. Its funny how you cannot see a single signboard pointing towards the boardwalk entry point. Get to L1 of Vivo City Mall and pass by the Tung Lok Signatures restaurant to get to the boardwalk.DRINKING WATER* Always carry an bottle with you to avoid purchase of water bottles at extra cost. All the rides have drinking water fountains to fill up on water. This applies to entire Singapore for that matter. We never purchased a bottle of water anywhere during our stay.FREE LOCKERS FOR YOU BACKPACK* You might have come across numerous posts advising you not to carry a backpack in USS since it might be a burden to carry around. Well/001 who DOESNT need a backpack right? I mean where are you going to store you towels/001 selfie sticks/001 change of clothes and snacks (shhhhhhhhh/001 you might get lucky if you play your cards right ;) )The trick is to keep the weight of the backpack to the bare minimum and use he free lockers available at some places. * There are free backpack storage places but they do come with a catch. They are free for only 45minutes after which you need to pay SGD4. However/001 there is no limit to the number of times you use the free lockers. All you need to do is check the waiting time for the ride and store the bags accordingly. There is a locker space available in Ancient Egypt section/001 where you can find the Revenge of the Mummy one of the best rides in USS. Also/001 it is close to The Lost World (Jurassic Park) where you can hop on the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure/001 another awesome ride. Trick is to find the free locker spaces and use them wisely cos you only need one person to hold your space for the ride/001 if you catch my drift ;)PONCHO* Weather conditions are as unpredictable as the US Presidential Elections. It might rain anytime/001 anywhere. You just need to be equipped enough to face it and take advantage of it. Yes/001 I meant take advantage of it because people don't venture in rain/001 duh. That is where having a poncho can come to your rescue. Ponchos nothing but plastic raincoats made of thin material which serves its purpose at a much cheaper cost than purchasing an umbrella at USS @ USD10/001 ONLY. Ponchos are available at 2 for SGD5. You just need to ask for those.FOOD @ USS* Numerous restaurants and food carts are available inside USS but the prices come to an average of SGD10 if you want to purchase anything. It is mentioned clearly that outside food/snacks are not allowed inside but they do not check you bags inside out. They just ask you to open up and show the items inside. So it is up to you to purchase food/snacks/drinks inside USS or sneak some inside *wink wink*TIPS:1. Finish all the popular rides like Battle Star Galactica (sci-fi city/001 roller coaster)/001 Revenge of the Mummy (Ancient Egypt)/001 Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure and Canopy Flyer (The Lost World)/001 during the lunch break when the waiting times are less. 2. Checkout the timings of shows like Waterwold (The Lost World)/001 Sesame Street (New York) and be there ahead of time to beat the queue.3. Try to plan your visit during the middle of the week like Tues/001 Wed. Waiting time might climb to even 90minutes during peak season and public holidays.4. Get a Universal Express entry pass if you want to beat the line/001 not applicable only for a few rides.If you research and plan your trip to USS properly/001 you can get the maximum out it. Definitely would recommend to everyone across different age groups.
Meidha A|None|2 February 2017|great rides|4|C937988DBAED59E67219730C5D3F92F5|I came when it was raining but I pretty much tried almost all rides that I want to ride. I first tried Transformers since it's indoor/001 and then I tried Battlestar Galactica Human/001 it was not really scary as I thought. If you want more extreme you should try Cylon one. The revenge of the mummy was a really nive experience because you ride roller coaster indoor and dark. it was really good.
Mandie B|Dubai- United Arab Emirates|2 February 2017|Fun filled family day - Sad about the rain!|5|D2B0F95D752A193F191E2F050E12B3FC|We had a great time at Universal Studios Singapore. It was fun rides for the whole family/001 great food and loads to see and explore. It was a bit humid and warm on arrival but this soon changed as we were about 1/4 into the park. It started raining...more like pouring down with thunder galore. This was such a pity because the whole park comes to a standstill and all except 2-3 rides stop working if there is thunder accompanying the rain. Luckily we went prepared with some ponchos in our bags/001 but even this was not enough for the down pouring because we were walking around in water about ankle high. We ultimately missed about 2-3 hours in our day just standing around under shelter waiting for the rain to subside which eventually did but because there was still thunder warnings the park remained to close the rides. I would def visit this park again/001 I would just plan to miss the rain and go on a sunny day. But seeing that Singapore has rain pretty much everyday I don't know why the creators didn't plan for the park to be more equipped to function in the rain or accommodate their visitors. We flew into Singapore and only had the one day to make Universal Studios work/001 so sad for us. And you pay quite a bit for tickets/001 so again...make it work for the visitors and instead having 80% of the park under rain and only 20% under roof in a tropical place with rain all the time....the math is a bit off I should say. It just leaves sad faces on kids that had been excited for this visit for weeks. What did save us was the booking of tickets online and the express passes. We only bought the package allowing one express pass and this helped us getting most of the rides in once the park opened fully again. The ques were endless since it was over peak season. So well worth the extra couple of bucks paid. We had our 5/001 10/001 16 yrs old boys with us. Got some great shots to remember and relived some of the family favorite movies!!
Lindy H|None|2 February 2017|Never Grow Up|5|39D03656D9C6C5157BD07ACCBAB8AA84|My partner and I had an amazing time here being big kids again. I would thoroughly recommending getting the VIP pass for the day to save lining up. The extra money is worth it/001 especially if your with children.
Khalid A|None|2 February 2017|Total excitement|5|E7BF56802738AC7C83AAC4113D3853FD|It was an amazing and different than the one in Paris or Orlando/001 where more attractions and zones to play at. We started from the entrance then went left for kids at far far away land then jerrasic park land then Egypt lands then sci fic where transformers are/001 in between them both lovely roller coasters very fast/001 then we ended at new York lands/001 for more fun i advice you at the entrance to buy the fast track where its very very useful we couldn't finish all zones at one day without it.. each ride that takes 45 m waiting line it took us 5 min to ride .. plus if you are single you can also use the fast track express as a single rider in most rides. Water lands opens at 3 pm .. also look at the schedule of the shows and try to catch up especially in new york the dancing band are very good. I didnt buy anything from stores to not carry many toys and gifts because the universal store at the gate have almost everything and every character u will see inside/001 so i bought when i was leaving just next to the gate/001 out side you can find some nice restaurants for dinner. Park starts from 10 am to 9 pm Wish you a happy experience
DANAAAAAAAAAAAA|None|2 February 2017|fun so much fun must see|5|F3B8BA522E86CB0716AFE2CE4E043624|its not just the games the ride the restorants its the full intertamint for all ages u go and spend all day long also big advice get the fast pass its worth it and if u go in the sumer dress light coz it gets hot but the most fun is the show its like a life thyater right infrant of you totaly wirth visiting
Sharon T|Singapore- Singapore|2 February 2017|Entertainment for the whole family|4|64BFA1DB74885DBD8BAE5E7A26CB4F90|Rides for all ages. Whole entertainment for half a day or full day. If you are impatient to queue/001 you can buy the fast pass. Sometimes queuing helps recompose you after a crazy ride.
m r|LIVERPOOL|2 February 2017|Don't get stung on fast pass charges. Disgraceful experience!|3|9B2CF4B7471180F7E06719665F57E6B0|Went here at the end of December as a party of four. On the way in/001 we asked about the price of "fast pass" tickets and it was 80 dollars each. Quite expensive on top of tickets/001 so had a think about it. Within ten minutes of asking the price/001 we went to buy them/001 only to be told they were now 100 dollars each! Unbelievable/001 but apparently this is normal practice. If the place is busy/001 they hike up the price. Absolutely disgraceful! Have been to Universal studios in other countries/001 have never known this happen. Also/001 couldn't use a lot of the rides due to the weather being bad/001 bug they don't offer a reduction in the price!
