Gould h|None|10 May 2017|Wonderful Family Time|5|9BD93B2DAC53DA55AFAA6C079F8B2647|The trip to Universal studio was a truly unforgetable experience for our children. It is a must-see if one visits Singapore for pleasure. Tickets are a tat expensive but still worth it since we are on vacation. It can be tiring and there are many rides / adventures that we tried which adds to an overall exciting time.
Jennifer H|Elanora Qld.|10 May 2017|Great for young and old!|5|2379C08306025233357FA6CCBC2195EE|The best tip I can give is to purchase the Express tickets for your visit. When the queues have a waiting time of 40 minutes + for a ride you will thank me for this advice. We simply showed the pass at the gate and were promptly shown the pathway up to the front of the queue. We went during the week and not school holidays and it was still busy. Great attractions - especially the Transformers 3D. Lockers are free for the rides where you are not allowed to take bags etc. Well run and very clean. Food was well priced as were the drinks. You can book on line and save but be sure of the day that you want to attend.
Minhas K|None|10 May 2017|Amazing! The best place to be in Singapore!|5|F39FA7255E03B3CBFAD5C5CC215A496F|Loved it! At first I figured this place was only meant for kids and family..but after all the crazy and thrilling rides /001I came out excited and happy !Highly recommended when u r in Singapore !!
MalDann|Perth- Australia|10 May 2017|Very Family Orientated|4|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|This attraction is very good for family fun. There are many things to see and rides to suit all ages. We spent a good day here and the attractions vary to meet all of a family's requiremnts. Waiting lines when we went were quite good at approximately 20 minutes each ride. We went mid week. The grandkids loved their time here and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and rides. The cost for express lane was quite rich so we decllned/001 however I believe there was not a benefit on the day we went. Might be benefictial on weekends. Have been here twice and will go back again.
Marc P|Maafushi Island|9 May 2017|Family trip to Sentosa|4|DB0F9C2A2C067201EB53A3F797567286|Spent the whole day in the park/001 as this was the main reason behind this family trip to Sentosa.Overall a good place: many attractions & shows/001 my 5 years old son just loved it.Queue weren't too bad/001 but on a busy day the "fast track/premium pass" must come in a handy... Although paying an extra 60 SGD even for a 5 years old kid is outrageous !!A very good family time in Sentosa for sure/001 and most probably the highlight of the trip
Shelley W|Tyabb- Australia|9 May 2017|Nothing to the original|3|334B30F6411A10FC2529588FA4870581|Was disappointed to see how different this one was compared to the original one in America. Not only is it smaller with fewer rides but the customer service was disappointing. We had paid extra money to get unlimited rides passes but was a waste of money due to the lack of rides and also due to rides being closed because of the rain (no one can control the weather) but when you can't go on rides and than you have to pay money to buy a plastic poncho just so you can go somewhere else in the park/001 so you can some kind of dry. Now that makes me angry.Save your money and go to USA. You will get the whole experience.... great rides and customer service with a smile and a laugh
SnehPrit|Bharuch- India|9 May 2017|Universal studio|5|462CA8C12019E37357125DB4A145538E|The fun place in Singapore is a good attraction for both young and children. Have a variety of attractions and enjoyable rides.
Santosh R|Pune- India|9 May 2017|Adventurous experience with pouring adernaline|5|0D7FC802683DEC5216E9ABA625DA80A9|It is a theme and amusement park located within Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) on Sentosa Island/001 near Harbourfront. It is the second one after Japan in Asia. This popular Hollywood series has more than 20 attractions. You should not miss upon the Canopy Flyer Roller Coaster/001 Jurassic park rapid Adventure/001 Water World Arena/001 Revenge of the Mummy and the Transformer. The queue is quite big and the wait time is around 20-30 minutes during weekdays but even longer on weekends. I would suggest you to avoid weekends but if you do not have any choice then plan your movement right and start the tour around 3 PM and finish all major ones till 6 PM. In many rides you are not allowed to carry any bags or in some rides not allowed to wear glasses. Therefore either handover all stuff to any of your friends or else use lockers to keep your stuff before you start your ride. Some of the rides are quite boring so do not waste your time over their rather select the once you are enjoying and repeat them as many times.
EddyWooi|Malaysia|9 May 2017|Fun and excited amusement park|5|79C72CD326BA143CE2082B195B4445BE|I had visit Universal Studio Singapore when it just operated in Singapore. The theme park are filled with numerous type of rides and attractions in the park itself. The one and must to try out ride in Universal Studio is their Battlestar Galactica which consist of 2 different feel of excitement on this ride.
gracieylicious|Taytay- Philippines|9 May 2017|Fun filled day with family|5|1BDFB7D16C618011B8910B4C2BEA2F71|The whole family enjoy a day of fun trying all the attractions our kids allowed to ride. The best attraction for us is the TRANSFORMERS and a must try for everyone! We'll surely back here when our kids can enjoy all of the attractions.TIPS: You can bring snack to eat while waiting in line for the ride.
bellabelle19|Singapore- Singapore|9 May 2017|My 3rd time and still planning return trips!|4|E03684CE2FEE07DEDE3BFD31B00E7DC9|It was a weekday but still long queues maybe due to group tours. Didn't get an express ticket that time as i didn't expect long queue but nonetheless/001 will be coming again!
Esther A|None|8 May 2017|The park I enjoyed most!|4|EC4035BD214EF28B8F2DD7CB4905EC2B|There are many fun places in Singapore/001 but I like Universal Studio very much although the entrance fees is quite expensive. The original price per ticket is S$73 but I got it with S$63 from my friend. FYI/001 there are another types of tickets which can skip queuing when you visit but this is a bit more expensive. When you arrive at the park/001 I would like to suggest you to take Universal Studio Map to explore the whole park. For me/001 I check which part of the park I would like to try first. After riding roller coaster or sth/001 I ticked the attraction which means I've already riding. By doing that/001 we can cover the park as much as we can. I would like to recommend to visit the park early so you can spend much time there.If you are a roller coaster rider/001 you should try these first as many people enjoy to take these also. For us/001 we have to queue over an hour to ride the Red one. For the convenience and safety of people/001 they place lockers near roller coasters. The lockers are allowed to use 75mins for free and they will after 75mins. Note: You are not allowed to bring any items if you would like to ride roller coaster. They will lend money if the lockers usage hour is more than limited hour.We took - Roller Coster (Red and Grey)/001 Transformer/001 Egypt/001 4D movies/001 Madgadascar.There are many show times in different places in the park. Before you visit/001 check that pamphlet in case you might see your interest.PS: I would like to suggest before you visit there. Please check the weather because when we visited/001 there was a rain with tremedous thunders. So/001 some of the places were shutting down in order to safe. So/001 I didn't try Jurassic Park which is one of my favourite place in the park.Enjoy you trip!
lazy2login|Singapore- Singapore|8 May 2017|A day's worth of fun|4|4D502C8410CFF02D27A91CD8DB8D7264|We went to USS with 2 teens and they thoroughly enjoyed the day. What we liked is the wide spectrum to accommodate the gung-ho and the mild. One teen had a whale of a time screaming her head off on the roller coaster/001 the other was soundly contented with the less adventurous rides.
MarzAttack69|Melbourne- Australia|8 May 2017|Fantastic Day of Fun|5|13C8D14814785E2315B2F89EB3EABFAA|What a fantastic place to go and have in. I suggest getting in early to get on your favourite ride as quick as possible and to avoid the crowds. If you have time restrictions and don't have a budget or money worries then i suggest the Quickpass/001 we bought it and it was the best $50 dollars spent ever/001 waiting in a line for an hour when its 30 degrees C isn't funny or time well spent. Be mindful that many rides rides have height restrictions so go online and view minimum height requirements. There's is lots of place to eat and get out of the heat. Do your self a favour and visit this theme park.
terryk01695|Liverpool- United Kingdom|7 May 2017|Day visit|5|19B835A53A116CBF0436AA70188D2688|We had a great time and enjoyed our day/001 it has the usual attractions to suit all ages and the parade was god plenty of restaurants that cater for all tastes. The kids of all ages will love it.
JakirHossain2014|Dhaka City- Bangladesh|7 May 2017|Amazing|5|36655B81F78ED0B6264077354D919DF0|A fantastic day out at Universal Studios with lots of fun and free rides/001 4D movie/001 roller coaster/001 foods and many more. Please keep a entire day for this place if you want to enjoy at fullest.
Sunil K|None|7 May 2017|What a theme park!|5|7D58E9F56B4A6937963A32A4DB4A89AA|So much fun when you visit Universal Studios. Few themes like Spiderman/001 Harry Potter/001 Shark ride and King Kong missing here but still good to visit.
Hannah_robbin|Singapore- Singapore|7 May 2017|Amazing place|5|94A63D92BC102C606877964B9F03AD8B|We spend full day at Santosa for visited. We paid 152 singapore dollar for two people. We try the roller coaster at the egypt museum that very amazing but we are so scare. Before we left they have water performance show that very excellent. Please don't miss that show. We'll go back again.
vinaybudda|Hyderabad- India|7 May 2017|Must visit in Singapore|5|DD6D0A2EA0CB33393D594DE0B6CB728A|There were many rides inside USS/001 must go are CYLON/001 MUMMY/001 TRANSFORMERS. There will be a wait time of one hour for each of the rides/001 and more than an hour for CYLON ride/001 if you go on holidays. Lockers are provided at each RIDE location to keep your belongings/001 better keep everything even coins etc in the locker to enjoy ride. Lockers are free for 50 min or so/001 after that you will have to shell out SGD 4 for hour(the machine won't give you change/001 so if you keep SGD 10 note/001 you will be paying SGD 10). Usually the wait time and RIDE time will be more than 50 mins/001 soiIts better if you keep your belongings in CYLON ride locker as the free locker time is 120 mins over there. This is the place I enjoyed most in Singapore. Happy riding!!
Louise M|Sydney- Australia|7 May 2017|Fun - long lines!|4|31E7A794B04691245ABFDCEDFD85F4AF|We booked through Viator/001 however/001 I'd make your own way there via public transport or taxi. Cheaper and quicker. It was fun as you'd expect. The fun was dampened by the long lines (I'd hate to be here in high season). Unless you pay an extra $50 for an express pass be prepared to wait (& wait). The express pass gives you priority to get on rides above others who have only paid the entry. The universal studio shop was good as was the shriek 4D and many others. Couldn't wait 60+ mins to get on the roller coasters (that last about 1 min). We stayed for 5 hours which was plenty long enough. It's not huge like the universal studios in the USA
Andrea F|Milan- Italy|7 May 2017|Impressive Holllywood-like experience|5|D6CF4F5134EAC9329922B694DDC9225E|Amazing jump into the moviemakers-Hollywood experience. Smart/001 funny and amazing experiences. A unique american-like experience
AshokNrao|Bangalore- Karnataka- India|6 May 2017|Good for a high Enthu with Kids|3|3AAC665583F93975E895D08BC3532107|Decent theme Park. I've seen better ones and had very high expectations. Most of it were simulators with high queues as it was a peak season!Rides were decent and the new additions to the US are good enough. My son enjoyed the all the moving Dolls a lot. All in all a decent place with not that great rides!
Baskaran P|None|6 May 2017|All in one|5|DD6FAA6982EC3EACDFD171337CBD7111|World people is to gather in this place. Really amazing place in this world. Many country people face shows power of humanity. What wonderfull place. All rides are so good. Really All kids eyes are open and see the other world. Water world program is really extreme to my experience. More time to take for all rides/001 but waiting hours is boring to me. Make big que in food court. It take more time. Totally best place for kids /001 youngsters and also old gen.Thank u/001 i will come again with my family. See u
marriedplustwo|Singapore- Singapore|6 May 2017|Incredible time but you need a fast pass|5|FE49B3994D9F0F406A2FC77416A7C1D7|We live in Singapore and therefore decided to invest in the annual membership with the fast -track passes and we do not regret it! We went Several time of course and every time we discovered something new. The Three main roller coasters are the Red one: high speed classic roller coaster the blue one :for advanced crazy roller coasters lovers as you will go high speed and upside down several time) and the Mommy ( which is genuinely great but also scary). Universal studio shows are also very good!! The transformers is not too bad either. The few issues that you need to be aware:1- Fast track passes are key of happiness!!! Very Long line and Locals are used to queue so they are not afraid to wait for a full hour or more ( I can not!!).2- The food is very bad and Super $ anywhere In the park so avoid or bring your stuff however there is an air conditioned little food street area that is delicious and cheap 30 Sec walk from the park and other good (more expensive) restaurants. If you want to eat well I suggest you Get out for 30min and return. 3- More often than one of the two roller coasters blue or red are down for maintenance so better call before or ask before paying your ticket if you do not have an annual pass. If the weather is bad it is 100% guaranteed that they will stop the blue and red roller coasters as they are outside. For young kids also lots to do/001 shows/001 Elmo/001 puss in boots/001 Shrek/001 etc...Enjoy!
May E|Mandaluyong- Philippines|6 May 2017|my universal studio get away|4|9B3E1E881D170562324E46E166BC752E|it was fun with my niece and nephews and memorable one....Spend a day here/001 transformer ride was awesome.
A TripAdvisor Member|None|6 May 2017| Holiday|5|None|Me and mom were arranged plan to Universal studio we can easily get this please by bus Everything about this please are wonderfulThe theme park/001 the place/001 the food and everyting. Recomended to come alone or with family eventhough the price is expensive but worth it.
Pictureant|Reading- United Kingdom|6 May 2017|Lovely Theme Park on a Lovely Island|4|C2637038A322DE0280197943B7309BF9|Being Singaporean and having been to Sentosa since my school days/001 It was really nice to be back after over 15 Years for a visit and this time with my teenage daughter. Having been to many theme parks all over the global /001 perhaps I was slightly disappointed with the overall size and coverage of the Park but overall it was very enjoyable to look around and take photos at the various attractions. My only negative would be the pricing as i felt it was slightly overpriced for what was being offered/001 but my local school friends did warn in my advance anyway so at least i knew i wasn't being overly critical as locals felt the same way/001 so if you are thinking of going buy the combination ticket to get some savings.
grace9770|None|5 May 2017|Need to add more rides|3|9918EBB25E13967DBD2923B60F9188A4|USS is a typical theme park where you can become a kid again and enjoy reminiscing all movies you watched through rides and other activities.I just hope Singapore can think of other rides or activity cause been here for 5 x since instayed in Singapore and it feels a little tedious going around since you already knew what to expect. Everytime I have a visitor coming over Singapore /001 we come here and tour them around.All others same same.
sriki77|Bengaluru- India|5 May 2017|Forget the crowd  focus on fun...then you will have fun! I did!|5|2279808975693AF1348060C221FB62DE|This was one day affair for my family. First/001 sentosa monorail broke down that day. Long queue from vivocity to sentosa through RWS bus. When i reach universal studios - i see a huge queue.It was really crowded on tuesday that was not holiday - but still. I upgraded the ticket with express pass for $50 SGD per ticket - that is steep; but it helped me cover all the activities. After i entered/001 we had huge rain pouring for 2 hours!! I am eternal optimist! - still i had loads of fun even with all glitches. I ensured crowd and weather never got in way of having fun with my family. So you can do it too!For vegetarians like/001 you need to go near Egypt restaurant for veg food - very limited options elsewhere. Please do the canopy ride and treasure hunt first since there is no express pass for it.
Shaila K|None|5 May 2017|I am an adult and I loved it...|5|2295BBCC4DE0CDD88C1733A53E72D613|Spend the entire day here/001 have the map plan activities and stick to it.Don't confuse it with Disney world/001 there are limited Disney character but plenty of Universal studio characters. I do not want to give out too much info/001lets the surprise off.Tip-There is buggy available on rent for young tots.Prepare for long queues for popular ride like Madagaskar especially with young children.Carry a umbrella and a water bottles for refills.comfortable shoesAdvance ticket booking.Tickets are to be collected at the basement/001so do not waste time queue if its e-ticket!
kumarie2016|Colombo- Sri Lanka|5 May 2017|My 2nd trip to Universal Studios|5|65554CFCBEE6F77DBE9EB754D666753B|Excellent place for adults and children to have a glorious time ! I highly recommend the Transformers ride which was very exciting. The only down side is that we got to Universal Studios by about 10 a.m. and after standing in a queue that was not very long for the tickets/001 once we joined the queue for the Transformers ride it took approximately an hour from the beginning until we reached the end of line as it extremely long since you cannot see the end of the line at any given point until you reach the very end. It keeps curving inside different chambers for a long time.
Flibbix55|Slough- United Kingdom|4 May 2017|A great day out|5|97158B79929BE1A25FB52C96384FB081|Lots of characters to meet and rides to go on for all ages. There were long queues but as I was alone I could use the single rider line which saved me a load of time! The water show however was the highlight and yes you will get soaked if you sit in the blue bit... unfortunately the parade was cancelled as they thought it was going to rain (though in the end it didn't) and as I went on a weekend they put on fireworks on the lake which is a nice way to end. What was really nice was that when I left after the fireworks there wasn't a huge queue for the cable car which Iexpected....
Mohit_G0yal|Gurugram (Gurgaon)- India|4 May 2017|Must visit place to explore HOLLYWOOD|5|7D83AFC26F937932BEE876978C756C60|I prefer each one traveling to Singapore must visit Universal Studios.It is the main attraction of Singapore.Inside this you can enjoy rides/001 dance/001 waterpark/001 different shows.Place is perfect for kids/001adults and senior citizens.
mikemiddler1|Aberdeen- United Kingdom|4 May 2017|Great family fun|5|950A14FE1DA1CB756CCCEA89033C3F1F|Small Universal compared to Florida but well worth a visit. Kids loved it. Plenty to keep you going all day
AKRCH|None|4 May 2017|Must do in singapore |4|3CBAC7BB952608AE8F272994C0AC9FA8|Went with my family to universal on Wednesday . Entered by 10 am .Started off with Madagascar ride then Shrek 4d /001 puss in boot roller coaster . Water world show is slightly modified Compared to what we saw in Dec . Transformers was good .Galactica roller coaster /001 treasure hunt and mummy ride and rapid adventure had one hour waiting time hence skipped .Would suggest to go during noon time as the rides are relatively less crowded towards 4 pm onwards .Food and eatables are expensive /001 better to pack something .If you have not done it in US or other countries this is a must
768colins|Perth- Australia|4 May 2017|Always a fun day out|4|84F87BA964F3F2E6074D2CC1BA3AC693|We have been to Universal a number of times and it is always a fun day out - although a bit expensive. The shows and rides are a lot of fun and there are options for all ages and thrill seeking levels. Remember to wear good shoes and bring plenty of water as it is a long walk around the whole facility.
Wong M|None|4 May 2017|Just Fun |4|C6D26D559A19C77E106F2F2CB2214D5D|A must visit place when you traveled to Singapore. Advice you to pre-booked your ticket online. I booked my ticket via klook and entitled some discounts which is much more cheaper than you walk in purchase.I have played most of the rides/001 most of the rides that not allowed to bring in your belonging there are baggage area provided. So no worries and enjoy your rides.Gentle reminder rides in The Lost World - River Raft Ride definitely make you soak with water
Roberts R|None|4 May 2017|Amazing day spent !|5|C91F8F8B80C13C8D480EBF947C1005D7|First I must start with saying - Fast Pass is a must !! With Fast pass it took still all day to get through everything and you definitely save quite a lot of time of not queuing up too much. Just for example - Jurrasic park ride (fast pass queue - 15min /001 normal 2h 35min). Attractions are amazing. Most of them would suit kids/001 but much fun for adults. Transformers is a must for any 3D enthuasist ! It was just lifechanging experience for me in theme parks ! Now i can never look back at other attractions after visiting it. On the other side - I must say /001 everything seemed quite cheap and affordable/001 but food however wasnt the best one in the dinner they had.
FahmeedFR|Dhaka City- Bangladesh|3 May 2017|Cue up for Transformers - worth it!|4|D0CAA4A5328E6DE818E3F723FF013AF1|Clearly/001 eeeverybody goes there to take the Transformers ride and I can safely say that it is worth it! even if you have to stand in line for more than an hour. In order to save yourself some trouble/001 go there before they open in the morning and run with everybody else to lessen the wait time a bit. Rest of the rides and areas are a bit too childish/001 but still/001 a good place to spend half a day
Revathi_Murali|Bengaluru- India|3 May 2017|Perfect place to spend a day in Sentosa|4|4693FA1725598A23A67EB4918CDAEEED|This is a must visit place for all the age groups if you are in Sentosa.Few recommendations out of our visit would be/0011. Go on time - 9AM/001 they open the gates/001 be present when they open the gates/001 so that you can atleast goto few attractions without much queue2. Take the map present in the entrance gate. It has a detailed explanation on the rides along with the age groups applicable. Spend some time and read the map carefully. So that you can decide upon which ride to take and which ones to skip3. Few shows here happen only on specific timings/001 so plan accordingly/001 if you want to see them.4. There are a lot of lockers available across the attractions. The locker available with "Revenge of the Mummy" is free for 45 minutes and then the charges start applying for every hour. But the locker available with "Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure" is charged from the first hour itself. So/001 think before using lockers. 5. Have some 2 dollar change in your own packets if you are dropping your luggage in lockers. The locker does not return you change/001 if you pay in excess. Have always dollars in multiples of 2 to avoid excess payment.6. Once you enter Universal Studio/001 decide whether you want to go in clockwise direction or anti-clockwise direction. Once you start a ride in a particular direction/001 do not change sides. It will waste your time. 7. Do not miss the Transformers ride - it is the best in the lot. Also/001 please go for Jurassic Park ride/001 Mummy's ride and the water show organized by stunt people. If you want to skip the lines and go fast for the rides/001 you can take express tickets. This place is crowded all round the year. so be prepared to stand in the queue for over an hour/001 if you get into the above mentioned rides late in the day. Food is available inside universal studios/001 which we felt was a little costly.
aidarulz|Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia|3 May 2017|Good family theme park|4|6BC21269A1DD59D7D788D94A4807E52B|It's a fairly big theme park with rides suitable for all ages. I've been there twice and I've got to say my favourite is the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. For families with young children/001 I would recommend starting with Hollywood & New York (where the Sesame Street rides are) and work your way counter clockwise (Madagascar/001 Far Far Away/001 Lost World/001 etc.). The rides in those zones range from the most child-friendly to the more daring ones for older kids/adults. The queue can get very long very quickly and the average wait is often between 30-45 minutes even on a non-school holiday period. Best is to get to USS as early as you can and go straight for the rides you really want to go on first. My choices would be:a) Revenge of the Mummyb) Jurassic Park Rapids Adventurec) Canopy Flyerd) Enchanted Airwayse) Puss In Boots's Giant Journeye) Transformers The Ride : The Ultimate 3D BattleIf you hate waiting in line for too long/001 you can either purchase the express passes for a steep fee or queue up in the single rider lane (if you/your group don't mind riding separately).
Mohamed E|None|3 May 2017|great place|5|0ACFEA6DCDF05053E0D020477F0FD702|it is a must to visit this place. a lot of joyful and many perfect games to be tried. you will find a lot of beautiful activities.
Kavita_korke|None|3 May 2017|Fun filled outing|5|F0259665875CB9300CB7291FEFACE929|Had read the reviews before visiting.loved the rides in these order: Galactica/001 transformer/001 revenge of mummy n jurassic boat ride. Kids will enjoy the far far away 4d movie n Madagascar boat ride. A small tip/001 all the above rides have a long waiting time but if you can afford to stay back after 5 pm then go for these rides in d evening/001 the queue will be extremely small between 6pm to 8pm
Prasanna S|None|3 May 2017|Uinversal Studios - A Complete Family fun package|4|30ABB604567EAB801922157D84D22029|This is a fantastic place for the entire family. Kids loved it. However you should buy express tickets otherwise the park is difficult to cover in a day with all the rides and shows. I visited USS on a long weekend and perhaps that added to the crowd and long queues at the rides. Very good eating options available inside the park. You can buy the tickets at the counter or even at the Sentosa station. They sell tickets for all the attractions in Sentosa
Prateekkakkar|Hyderabad- India|3 May 2017|Awesome place|5|0C632CB81B4C74C093BD4DFDBC49C47F|Fantastic place to spend your day with your friends & family. Properly maintained/001 a bit crowded as it is one of the most attractive attraction in singapore but you will definitely enjy the rides in the studio. Must try - egypt ride/001 Jurassic park & transformer one
Amanda J|Wellington- Wellington- New Zealand|3 May 2017|Leave your expectations at the door ...|4|6F76ADBAD4DFF4EE1C42441DEDE5410B|This theme park is awesome as long as you do not compare it to the original. It has all the feel of a Universal Studios. Food and drinks are expensive but if you plan for that it won't be a shock. About $6.50 for a bottle of water. I read the Trip Case reviews before going so arrived early on a Wednesday at 09:30am and there were already about 1/001000 people lined up! I was going to tough it out but the heat was too much so I purchased an express pass for $50SGD. It allowed me priority entry well ahead of the big crowd and a maximum wait time of only about 5 mins! I only rode 4 rides because of my timeframe. Transformers/001 Cyclone/001 Battlestar Galactica and The Mummy but it was worth it! It is hot and sticky in the line and some do not have air conditioners only fans going. The express allowed me to bypass the crowds. The staff here are fantastic with queue jumpers. They simply redirected them to the back of the line politely and won't engage in any further conversation with them and usher you forward. Don't forget to pack a hanky or flannel for the sweat. I will definitely be back again for a full day.
Cherrie T|None|3 May 2017|One day is not enough is didn't buy the express pass.|3|CFE510273950D11EB9DD2232ECBB8C10|Is exciting to go but not the walking made us tired/001 is the queuing for turns. However/001 the express pass is so so so expensive. I bought one in the end but also didn't go and try all the rides. The timing for shows should have more frequency. As the tickets are really very expensive/001 if compare with the zoo and bird parks. The foods in the restaurants is even more expensive/001 compare with the hotel which I stayed in Sentosa and they didn't taste so great either. Also/001 always hard to find a table in the restaurants.
kadbatay|Nueva Ecija Province- Philippines|3 May 2017|Quite great|3|74CA32E2E9E19DA3AECACD0FB70496C2|It is really a fun place to visit. Rides are very enjoyable. Lines take about 30 minutes to ride. The foods are REALLY EXPENSIVE. 6 dollars for a small coke drink? Come on. Not much exciting rides for older people because most rides are just exciting enough for kids. Tip: Bring drinking bottles because there are a lot of water refilling stations everywhere.
itsmeyannickbonn|Ninh Binh Province- Vietnam|3 May 2017|Great place but...|5|8DD872820C26A45A4613E37653A43743|Do not ever visit these place on weekends or during public holidays if you don't like being on a very crowded place. Aside from that/001 the place is amazing though quite expensive.
Zhaffi|Singapore- Singapore|3 May 2017|Wonderful place for the old and young|5|E9944101BBDD900BEC0925C95047A530|I was skeptical about USS at first even though I am local Singaporean and USS was only 30mins drive from home. It was my son's 2nd Birthday and my wife plan a trip to USS. It was an enjoyable place for the young and old and I was very suprised at how all the events/001 shows and rides are well planned out. It was a hectic day out bit it would be best if anyone visiting USS to reserve 2 days as 1 day will be very rushing to sit on all rides.
