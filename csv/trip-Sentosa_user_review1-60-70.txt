Most rides that had public attraction has longer waiting queue. Please purchase the Express Pass if you want to enjoy the rides with minimum waiting time.- Food was quite OK, had lunch at the restaurant near the Madagascar area. - Due to the gloomy weather towards the evening, most of the rides has stopped including the parade at the Hollywood lane.- I am aggrieved of the condition of the prayer room; which is located at the back and only can accommodate 5 persons at one time (in each male and female room). Perhaps the Management can allocate a dedicated area which is more comfortable for the Muslims to pray.

In terms of the location, before this, the hotel area is very strategic and nearer to KLCC but due to major construction near the KLCC park, many routes to KLCC were'nt accessible. Room condition = bad. Smelly bath tub. I could hear the noises from the room next door. We had breakfast buffet, selection of food = not interesting. This will be my first and last stay in The Zon.

This time we stayed at Water Chalet (last year was at Garden Chalet). Hotel rooms still need to be improved. Furniture need to be refurbished. If the hotel can provide bathrobe it would be nice. Please add more variations on TV channels. Landscapes well designed and well maintained.

Nice interior, staffs are so friendly. Kids especially had fun with with the Christmas decorations in the garden, small pond and wooden house.Others - Parking space, at first we were a bit difficult to find parking area but managed to get to the parking area. Food-we had breakfast buffet, the food selections are OK. Can't expect more, since it is a complimentary by the hotel. Room is quite small for a family of 5 and NOT sound proof, well it was a last minute booking by the way. I've requested for extra bed and i got extra pillow, towel and room slippers!

Had 1 night stay - room is not so big, just nice for a family of 3 (with 1 baby). I thought the temperature here is cool and breezy, but it was not! At night there was a dance show.. we dined out at 1 of the italian restaurant, the spaghetti was quite OK. There was a little farm with rabbits and pony... you can bring your kids to ride the pony as well. Overall experience - If i want to stay at Bukit Tinggi, I would rather choose The Chateau..

Staff at reception area was OK, not so friendly, just doing their job. Hotel near to Alamanda, it's quite convenient from the Hotel. Breakfast buffet - not up to my expectations. The worst thing during my stay in this hotel is my toilet is not functioning-even though the matter has been reported. Technical staff attended and fixed it, but it was still not functioning. The hotel didn't offer any other room to us. Since it just a 1 night stay, can't expect more from the Hotel.

We paid $160 return for our trip from the hotel to the kula eco parkthe cafe there is nice , we enjoyed our mealthe entry fee and the price of their souvenir are very expensive. my kids bought 2 sleep toys - lizards, it cost me $120 to buy two sleep toys - but I just bought it for them as they have such a great time there and wanted to have those two green lizarad as memories

The first half was very enjoyable up until after lunch that we were basically stuck in the boat for 2 or 3 hours via they are dropping passengers to other island resorts.. I would prefer they provide an option where we can continue to stay on the island til 2:30 pm then drive us back to the Denarau port ( 30 mins ride ) If we take half day option then we will miss out the lunch session If take full day option would be too long for young kids Therefore we thought combo which is 9am to 3 pm would be good ( without realising that from 12:30 to 3;00pm would be stuck on the boat to drop other passengers) which is really suck when young kids getting frustrated

Our kids loved the pool and we swam at the children's side of the pool every day . It's from 0.3m to 1m high deep. The water slide is great fun for kids too.Our room was very quiet and the bed was very comfortable However the bathroom is very old and the bath tub is rusty and dirty too. You just don't have the mood to take a long bathWe have tried thecouple spa which is at a good price and was very good . It's Fj$330 for couples to have 1 hour massage and 30 min facial and then milk bath( outdoor area but private area ）for as long as you like . We tried the Lagoon restaurant for curry night and seafood night which are great . Food was awesome and kids loved the children height buffet table (but had very limited choices and kids from 5 years old had to pay $20 per head ... we thought kids should eat free but it wasn't the case.The Salt restaurant was ok , pasta was ok but it took a long time for the food to come out The Kids club was not good . My kids went twice ( unwillingly ) as the activities were boring ( make craft eg. Bunny ear and basket ).. the worst thing was the staff doesn't seem to be friendly to my kids .. so my kids didn't feel comfortable with them ... also the kids club charged $10 per kid per 2 hours ... while other hotels do not charge extraToday when we checked out , we saw the bill had lots of extra items eg community fee $1 or $2 and Tips... we also had 3 mysterious items as tips ranging from $3 to $18 ...we had these removed because we didn't make them. when we tip we usually just give cash to the person directly. I felt this was a bit dodgy so here's a reminder to check the hotel bill statement carefully We had breakfast buffet at thelagoon restaurant on the 1st day which charged $50 per person .. the breakfast was ok .. but we tried the Westin at ocean oasis which was next door ( you can walk past the waitu club near the beach to reach this hotel ) their breakfast is only $25 and had much more choice for a buffet breakfast ( with champagne too ).. we also tried breakfast at Nadi town (Zig Zag cafe - big breakfast is$17) ... so we feel Westin has the cheapest and best breakfast Also at the back of the car park at Sofitel , you can take the dollar bus which take you around the island and then to Nadi town ($1)... so we didn't take the Bula bus which is $9Taxi from Sofitel to Martintar is $40 return , there are lots of good restaurants there e.g. Tu's place , bounty restaurant Overall we enjoyed our stay

I asked the lady if the kids can have some chicken then she go to the kitchen to talk to the chef .. it took at least 40 min for the chicken to be ready to come out .. kids were starving and I think if you charge $20 per kids then should st least provide enough food to themThe seafood platter was great Desert is also super yummy

Some maintenance work were going on the entire beauty of the hotel was ruined because of this. They wanted us to pay the entire amount of 4 days at the time of check-in which I felt was not a good thing to do. The rooms were big but old. Despite following up atleast 6 times, the wifi was not made working.The bathroom was small. The A/C was not working and we had to shift the room and still the condition was nothing different.The sleep on day1 was a nightmare. The power went off at around 2 am in the night and the generator also failed to work. We couldn't sleep the whole night. They dont offer complimentary breakfast. Looking at the price they charge for a room one would expect for a complimentary breakfast. Overall below average experience.

The view from the sea facing balcony was a treat. We stayed for one night in this resort. The service and food were average/poor. A spoon was not provided along with the coffee maker, so we couldn't mix the sugar and coffee powder and hence we called up the room service. Even after multiple reminders, we did not get the spoon. Also while checking out, we called up the reception to send a boy to pick-up our luggage. After waiting for almost 20 min, we had to carry the luggage on our own. The food we ordered for dinner was below average but the beverages were good

We visited this place in the monsoons and the road which led the way to the resort was literally untravellable. They could have done something to make the path a little better. The initial impressions about the cottage set up were good. We took a double bedroom cottage. The sheets were dirty and the bathrooms were pathetic. We also observed that they were understaffed. There was no running restaurant and no wifi as mentioned on their boards and advertisements. When asked about wifi, the manager asked us to connect from the reception area, which I felt was a little too much for the rate they charge. The breakfast was pathetic too. The room boy told us they were understaffed and the cook was on holiday. We were totally disgusted with this hotel and that's when we met the owner who kept blaming his staff for everything that went wrong,which I didn't think was very nice on his part. While we were checking out, we happened to see another family with a kid complaining about the leakage from the so called Bamboo Hut they stayed in. The other amenities/activities they offered were archery,badminton court, bamboo rafting etc. Out of these, we were able to do only Archery. The rafter was also on leave. Hope both the cook and the rafter come back soon. Finally we checked out the next day itself telling ourselves that never again would we come here again.

Each ride takes 60-90 minutes in never ending queues in Singapore hot weather and for a mere 2-3 minute ride. The entire amusement park is too small and over-hyped. The children below 10 years cannot enter so many rides. If you are still keen to visit the place, enter through single rider queues. Though you miss the fun of being together with your family and friends but the same is worth as the waiting time is reduced to 5-10 minutes as against normal 60-90 minutes.

We had a great time, there was a wide variety of animals and we all loved it. The animal shows were good and we especially loved the monkey feeding. Plan all day for this zoo as it takes a while to see it all but it's well worth it. Orangutans were my favourite. Can't be missed when visiting Singapore.

We opted to have the paired cocktails with our meals and were glad we did. The food was good quality and we enjoyed all our meals, my personal favourites were the pork with crackling and apple and what turned out to be the fois gras, something I would not have ordered normally. The experience makes you appreciate your eyesight and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Be aware though like everything in Singapore it was very expensive. Overall it cost us over $300 Singapore dollars, but you pay for what you get and it was worth it.
Kim M|6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86|Hotel|Singapore: Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay|4| “Premier lounge was worth it.”|review_481151417|We booked here as Accor members (travelled as a family with my parents who are also Accor members) and booked two rooms on the premier levels so we had access to the premier lounge. This extra cost was definitely worth it given the price of alcohol in Singapore. The rooms were clean and serviceable and we had a great view from ours overlooking Clark Quay and the Marina bay and Gardens by the Bay Area. We had our little girl with us so we couldn't actually use the premier lounge itself much. But we were aware of this before we booked and hotel staff made sure we still got the benefits of it. We had drinks during happy hour in the Le rouge bar down on level 7 and had breakfast at the Square restaurant which has more options anyway. We still went and got water and soft drink from the premier lounge when we wanted and the staff would bring plates of nibbles down to us at the bar during happy hour if we asked or otherwise we did a takeaway plate ourselves. We liked the pool area as well. We would especially like to thank 'Crystal' who served us on many occasions and always had time to say hello to us and our little girl. The only complaint was one night the power went out and our aircon stopped working. We requested someone to fix it the next day and they said it had been fixed, but that night it stopped working again and we had to get someone to fix it at 11pm at night which wasn't ideal. I didn't feel the staff at the front desk cared when I complained and did nothing to make up for it. However despite this I recommend stating here as we enjoyed our stay and the staff overall where pleasant and attentive and the hotel is in a good location.
Kim M|6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86|Restaurant|Siem Reap: Bloom Cafe and Training Centre|3| “Awesome milkshakes and coffee, hit and miss with the cupcakes.”|review_481138417|I was unsure what to rate this cafe as we found it very hit and miss. We went here twice. The first time we got cupcakes to take away and I really enjoyed them, although my husband didn't like them because they were covered in cream cheese icing which he doesn't like. The second time we ate in, and all three of the cupcakes I shared with my husband were terrible (although they looked pretty). On the other hand the milkshakes we got were close to the best either of us has ever had and my parents who came with us raved about their coffees. So I think overall I'd recommend going if you like milkshakes and coffee and take a gamble with the cupcakes and see how you go.

As it was low season in Siem Reap we were the only two on the tour and had Phat as our own personal guide. Phat was very informative and told us about his experiences growing up in Siem Reap. We enjoyed all the different foods and particularly the night market at the end, followed by the stop at the brewery and a tasting plate of bugs. I've only not given it 5 stars because we felt the cost was a little high and some of the food items such as the soups/noodles were a bit repetitive. Overall an enjoyable evening and we highly recommend when visiting Siem Reap.

We got our hotel to contact them and ask to book in a tasting. They showed us where they make the alcohol. We got to try all the different flavours. They also have alcoholic jam. We bought several smaller bottles as they are easier to transport home in our suitcases. Highly recommend. The bottles are lovely and great for souvenirs or gifts.
Kim M|6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|3| “Transformer 3D ride and Cylon Ride are the best”|review_480851065|Firstly to be fair we live near all the theme parks on the Gold Coast in QLD Australia and because we go to these on a regular basis we couldn't help but compare USS to these. My husband and I both agree that it pales in comparison to what we are use to getting from our theme parks here in Australia. We found that there were only really 4 rides for adults (the two dualing roller coasters, transformers 3D ride and the mummy ride) and that the rest are all kid rides. These four rides were great but after riding them, and then watching the waterworld show there was nothing left for us to do there. There was excessive amounts of stores and restaurants and plenty of kids rides, so would be better for families I imagine. Also I wouldn't even attempt to do USS without buying the express pass. The lines were ridiculously long and we were thankful we spent the extra money. The Cylon ride was pretty much always at around an hour long. Getting into the park itself was also a joke we got there at bang on opening and waited for 40minutes in line just to get in and we went on a weekday. Overall we had a good day but we only spent four hours there all up and paid just over a hundred dollars each for the tickets and express pass, so it was an expensive four hours.

It was very good, a short Tuk Tuk ride from the centre of Siem Reap. It was set in a mango orchard and there was tank after tank after tank. Plus artillery guns, a helicopter and plane and numerous guns and missiles and mines. You can actually pick the guns up and take photos with them. Information supplied was informative and really puts into perspective the atrocities suffered by this wonderful country. We all ended up enjoying it and highly recommend it for those who want to learn more about the history of Cambodia.

We had two rooms, one for my mum and dad and one for me, my husband and our 20month old little girl. We were met at the airport by Any who immediately fell in love with our little girl as did the rest of the staff. All staff were wonderfully helpful and friendly. Our rooms were lovely and the pool area and restaurant were beautiful. We found the location to be perfect. Night markets were just up the street (turn to your left out the door of the hotel and just keep walking they're like 50m down the road). We also ate at Genevieves restaurant which was very nice, you walk straight down the street again about 50m away (see my review for this restaurant). The hotel is basically located in walking distance to all the restaurants and pubs you could want. There is a bit of noise from outside but this is the price of staying in town. All of us are heavy sleepers and this didn't trouble us at all. I've stayed in bigger style hotel chains in my travels and the service at this hotel trumped them all. They all remembered our names and greeted us when we were leaving or coming back to the hotel and best of all no large tour groups. Highly recommend this hotel if staying in Siem Reap.

Definitely recommend these at $2.50 for four spring rolls it was awesome value. We also loved the lok lak and the chicken quesadillas. Be warned they are a massive serving not like I'm use too and probably the best I've ever had, who knew I had to go all the way to Cambodia to get awesome Mexican food. Overall all meals were great and the prices were cheap. Highly recommend. Also make sure to get your hotel to book or you are unlikely to get a table.

We had Suntine (sorry not sure about spelling), he jokingly asked us to call him Mr T. As we had our 20month old with us we did 3-4hrs in the morning and then had to go back to the hotel for naps and then spent the afternoon relaxing. We did Angkor wat first up and Suntine dropped us at the back end of the temple which worked brilliant because we did the inner sanctums at the top of temple first and as we finished there and explored the entrance all the big tour groups were moving towards the rear of the temple complex. We then went to Ta Prohm and then onto Banteay Kdei, we were gone by 7am and back by 11:30am. The second day we did Angkor Thom and Preah Kahn again gone by 7am and back by 11am. The third day we did Banteay Srei, The landmine museum and the Butterfly farm. This time we were gone by 8am and back by about 12pm. I devised the schedule myself and they were happy to accommodate. Our driver had great English telling us about his life and the villages we passed through. He was safe and reliable and we highly recommend him. They were very reasonably priced especially by Australian standards, if we were ever in Siem Reap again I would definitely book through here.

We booked over the internet and got seats in the B section. They were $25 each and were well worth the money. The performance is a mix of theatre and acrobatics. The performers were full of energy and it made for a very entertaining and fun night. You can even have photos with the performers after if you wish. The show we saw was Sokha. We took our 20month old and she also thoroughly enjoyed it the only noise she made throughout the performance were 'oohs and ahhhs', like the rest of us she was totally enthralled by the performers.

My husband and I got a meat platter to share which had steak, sausages, lamb ribs. bome marrow and black pudding stuffed in a capsicum and an onion stuffed chorizo. We also ordered a side of duck fat roast potatoes and salad. The meat platter was delicious and I highly recommend the potatoes. They also have a good range of beers on tap. Service was good, they kept our drinks up. I've only deducted a point because it took quite a while for our meal to come out. They apologised for it and said they were understaffed in the kitchen that evening. Overall I highly recommend if you're a lover of meat.

You can sit in the seats and pretend to be front benchers. There's an entire room that shows all of the prime ministers of Australia. We found the kids area excellent. Our 18month old played in there and then we took turns watching her while the rest of us explored the building. Old Parliament House is a beautiful old building and worth a trip to when visiting Canberra.

The memorial itself is beautiful and touching. We really enjoyed the museum. I particularly liked the war plane area. They show a short cinematic film in there throughout the day which is really good depicting a bombing done by the allied forces. There is also an excellent kids area. My 18month old loved it. They can pretend to steer a submarine, fly a helicopter and fight in the trenches. I can't wait to go back because it was impossible to see everything in one visit.

The grounds are lovely and the rooms were well kept and modern. They put up a roll away bed for our little one without even asking which was great. My parents ate there and the dinner was lovely and great value because they used their Accor card. My husband and I went out for dinner while my parents baby sat. We didn't feel like walking. A taxi costs $9 to get to all the restaurants. About the only thing that I could complain about was the breakfast. It was a bit poor, lacking in options and quality. Overall will stay here again.
Kim M|6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86|Attractions|Brisbane: Boggo Road Gaol|3| “Brisbane history”|review_455539762|We did this tour because I wanted to see inside the prison and see the differences to the modern day prisons that I've seen as part of my work and you can only do this by way of a guided tour. I found the tour interesting and informative. Our tour guide was a young girl and I get the feeling that she's new at this. The tour was a little bit awkward I guess is the word and it sounded like she was reciting a script rather then relaxing and telling the stories her own way. I reckon given more experience she'll become quite good, as she seemed to know her stuff just needs some more experience.Personally I prefer to walk around casually and read plaques rather then do a guided tour, like the Melbourne gaol. You can only go in certain areas and there's a bit of opening and locking gates behind us during the tour. But I believe this is all due to our crappy nanny state government and its ridiculous health and safety rules, plus a lack of funding, not the fault of the tour guide at all. Our government should be ashamed that a really good tourist attraction such as this is looking at being redeveloped and is going to waste. I felt the gaol itself would be better and more interesting then the Melbourne Gaol if the funds were there and the rules and restrictions were more flexible.
Kim M|6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86|Restaurant|Brisbane: Summit Restaurant & Bar|5| “One of my favourites”|review_454672903|I've dined here on four occasions and have loved the food, ambience, view and service every time. I've been meaning to do this review for a while. This restaurant is perfect for special occasions, including a romantic night out without children. Although we have taken our little one during a special lunch we had with family. The last time I dined here was in November 2016. I went with my sister and we had a girls night out. We had the "romantic set meal for two" which we found hilarious but the food was delicious. Cost $90 and included 5 courses and a French martini each. When the fifth course a shared platter of desserts came out we hardly touched it because we were so full from the four previous courses. We tried everything though and like the previous four courses it was all delicious. We had I think it was potato soup as our second course. My sister who doesn't really eat soup declared it to be the best soup she's ever eaten and I had to forbid her from licking the bowl clean, it is after all a fine dining restaurant. Just a hint it does get busy on the weekends so you must book and it can be a pain to find a park so leave plenty of time to find a park and make it to your table booking on time.
Kim M|6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86|Restaurant|Tamborine Mountain: St Bernard's Hotel|3| “Expensive and average food, but great view.”|review_436753333|Went here for lunch. I ordered the macadamia chicken and salad and my husband had the ribs. My meal was fine but not worth the $30 price. My husbands ribs were barely edible, if he wasn't so hungry at the time I'm not sure he would have eaten them. They were extremely chewy, kind of like overcooked steak. Apart from the lovely setting and view I wasn't impressed by this place. Next time we go up the mountain will be taking a picnic and going to the lookout area for lunch.

We had our 15month old with us and she seemed to enjoy the walk. It was very peaceful and pretty. Took us about an hour to complete. I only rated it 3 stars due to value for money as I thought $40 ($20 per adult) was a bit steep for what is essentially a pleasant walk through the rainforest.
Kim M|6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86|Restaurant|Sydney: Medusa Greek Taverna|5| “Great food and great service”|review_385198987|My husband and I ate here on the last night of vivid for a night out while my parents babysat. We had a great night. We ordered the tzatziki dip for entree and it was better then what we've eaten in Greece. For mains we had the lamb shoulder and a lamb and mushroom pastry dish. We like to share meals when we go out so they put the meals between us and gave us separate plates. I cut the lamb shoulder with a spoon it was so tender. Both dishes were delicious and great portions. I highly recommend the medusa special dessert. It was so different and delicious. Service was also great. Make sure to book in advance.
Kim M|6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86|Attractions|Cape Town Central: Table Mountain Aerial Cableway|5| “Breathtaking views”|review_374825811|Loved this cable car experience. It zips up and down at quite a fast rate and rotates at the same time. My ears popped going up and down. The views from the top are spectacular. We were blessed with beautiful sunny weather and virtually no wind and 100% visibility in all directions. Make sure to take your time and walk around the many signed paths. Make sure to check their website before going as the next day after we went the winds came in and it had to be closed. This is a must when visiting cape town.

Cheap entrance fee and you need no more than an hour to see it. Interesting bit of history. Would recommend only visiting if you've got the time to do so.
Kim M|6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86|Attractions|Rustenburg: Zip 2000 at Sun City|5| “So much fun.”|review_374822060|We booked this as we were in suncity for a few days with family. The guys pick you up from the welcome centre and it's a short drive to the zip line. I went with my husband and we loved it. The guys are professional and friendly and like to joke around a lot. My 65year old father in law did it as well and loved it too. I recommend wearing a jumper and long pants when doing this in the colder months as it was freezing whilst flying down the line.
Kim M|6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86|Hotel|Livingstone: Royal Livingstone Victoria Falls Zambia Hotel by Anantara|5| “Drinks with a view!”|review_374818001|We stayed here for 3 nights with family. The hotel is set in a national park and therefore you will encounter zebra, giraffes, monkeys, Impala and there's even a resident crocodile. The rooms are comfortable and modern and they were very accommodating with our little one providing a cot and extra bottled water. The sundeck sits on the Zambezi river and you can see the mist from the falls off to the left. It was very relaxing sitting and drinking and watching the sunset behind the river. The falls are a 10minute walk away and entry is free as long as you show your key from the hotel. You will get soaked, embrace it. We had so much fun we went again the next day. My only small criticism is the lack of choice with food and sometimes we found the service at breakfast a little slow. My husband ordered poached eggs one morning and they just never came. But I still give it 5 stars because we loved it so much. Highly recommended.
Kim M|6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86|Hotel|Hwange National Park: Wilderness Safaris Linkwasha Camp|5| “Superb, excellent, luxurious.”|review_374752755|We stayed here for 3 nights as part of a conference tour. We brought along our 9month old as she was allowed due to our group having booked out the entire camp. Our whole group had a wonderful time. I was gob smacked at how luxurious our tents were, there was nothing they hadn't thought of. The whole place is like a small 5 star luxurious boutique resort in the middle of nowhere. I loved being able to lie in bed and look out over the watering hole and watch the animals come in for a drink. We had the family tent so we had the added bonus of having a bath tub with the same view. The staff were all friendly and as guests we were never left wanting. Food was great and they even provided a cake and champagne for my 30th birthday on the last night. A big thank you to Buli our guide for the 4 days. He was very informative and we were excited to see wild dogs on the last day. I can't recommend linkwasha highly enough, it was sad to have to leave and some back to the real world.
Kim M|6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86|Hotel|Sun City: The Palace of the Lost City|3| “Starting to show its age”|review_374318360|The entrance into the palace is stunning and beautiful and the crystal room where we had breakfast each morning was magnificent and the rooms were huge. We stayed here 3 nights with a baby and they provided a cot as well. The rooms whilst big are starting to show signs of age and are due for renovation. When we first got there the rooms aircon was on freezing despite it already being freezing outside. We turned the aircon off in the end as it didn't seem possible to adjust it. We also found the lighting terrible, not sure if this was to try and cover up the faded carpet and the general aging in the rooms. The overall service from the staff was good, not excellent. I think I just expected more from the palace and was left wanting.
Kim M|6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86|Hotel|South African Airways|1| “Worst experience ever.”|review_374314413|We used SAA a total of four times over a two week period during our recent holiday to South Africa. I've never really had any issues with any airlines I've flown before so I was very disappointed with the level of customer service for these flights. We had problems on every single flight. On every flight they had last minute gate changes. On the last flight we sat on the Tarmac for 40mins without aircon and everyone on the plane was getting hot and uncomfortable. We were travelling with a 9month old and she started to get overheated and grumpy. The air hosts didn't offer everyone bottled water while we waited which might have helped a bit. We had luggage issues on the third flight we did. We had flown two flights previous with the same luggage and they simply combined our suitcases together, one was 15kg and the other 27kg. The luggage limit is 23kg per person and on the first two flights this was not an issue on the third flight they decided me and my husband couldn't combine our luggage and we had to rearrange some stuff and take a heap on as carry on which is a pain when travelling with a baby. We are very experienced travellers and have never had this happen with any other airline ever. We also had a pram that we had to wait for when we got off the plane on the Tarmac. Twice they unloaded all the suitcases first whilst we stood in the sun on the Tarmac for 20mins with a baby (along with other parents and their children) waiting for our pram. It would have made more sense for us to collect it inside. We also had issues for two of the flights as the seating was booked apparently incorrectly by our travel company with our baby. Apparently it was impossible for them to fix the problem, however after much arguing on my part common sensed prevailed and they printed a boarding pass for my baby (who sits on my lap anyway and doesn't require a seat). We were travelling as part of a conference and the majority of people I spoke with were disappointed with attitude of many of the staff who didn't seem to care about customer service. I have never been so glad to get on a Qantas flight and be served by friendly competent people.

Ate here the first time because it was convenient. Came back a second time because the food was awesome and great value for money. The game platter was nice but for a really awesome dish try the kudu steak with wild berry sauce or the gemsbok Wellington both were so good we couldn't decide which was better and even better the dishes were great value for money. Also creme brulee was delicious for desert.

Our room was absolutely beautiful with the most amazingly comfy bed ever. They had provided a cot and set it all up even providing a small penguin toy for bub. They even supplied baby toiletries and bathrobe for our little one. All the small touches made the stay one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. The service was outstanding, the breakfast delicious and do not miss the afternoon high tea. So good!

Can't recommend them highly enough. Beautiful scenery and a fun and relaxing flight.

They were big, clean, airconditioned and came with free wifi. The hotel itself is very cute and the staff very helpful and it was so cheap, at least by Australian standards. It's a 2minute walk to all the restaurants on the main street. Would recommend staying here. FYI its located the very first right after the sign, follow around the park, don't go up the one way streets.
Kim M|6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86|Hotel|Athens: Amalia Hotel|5| “Loved it”|review_226042735|We stayed at amalia hotel 3 times over a period of two weeks. I enjoyed all three stays. The staff are wonderful, the breakfast was delicious and the rooms were big, modern, and clean. They came with aircon and free wifi and we payed a very reasonable rate. Our room had a huge king bed that was very comfy. We arrived very early on our last stay and they let us keep our bags in their storage so we could go shopping in the plaka. Normal check in is 2pm but they kindly had a room available for 10am. We left early the next morning and because we couldn't get the buffet breakfast they arranged and had ready for us a packed breakfast at 5am. Amalia is also very conveniently located. Its a 10minute walk to the centre of the plaka (just exit the front door of the hotel turn right, take your first right and follow the street all the way to you see a leather shoe store, turn right and there's shops after shop, keep walking and you'll get to the restaurant and tavern section). I recommend thanasis restaurant (see my other review for this). The hotel is also 10mins walk to the acropolis, the acropolis museum and the zeus temple and 2 mins walk to parliament house where you can see the changing of the guard every hour on the hour 7 days a week.

Menu seemed vast and judging by everyone else's food that I noticed at the restaurant the chef knows what he is doing. Also the price was cheap by our Aussie standards. We paid about $40 Australian dollars for two main meals, a dessert, two beers and two pepsi. Given the quality of the food it would have been about $120 in Australia easy. We had to wait a while for the waitress to serve us but I think we scared her because we were difficult to communicate with.

The gyros are €2.40 for either chicken or pork. We couldn't find them on the menu, you have to ask for them. We also had alfa draught beer to go with which was delicious. We spent spent €10 in total including a tip. We also noticed the other food going out looked fantastic. Will definitely go back again. Cheap, fast and delicious. Just a tip there's a Frozen yoghurt place next door, we suggest getting dessert from here, we ate it as we walked through the plaka back to our hotel. It was so delicious.

The most spectacular views combined with interesting and beautiful ruins really creates the wow factor. A must see if you visit Greece. I've travelled all over the world, seen the pyramids at Egypt, the taj mahal and the anghor wat temples at Siemreap. This is easily up there with them. Seriously do it!!!! Also don't sook out and not climb to the top to see the stadium, trust me the effort is worth it.

The views from the meals area are absolutely breathtaking and the reception area and meals area look like a 70s style ski resort, which was kind of charming. The buffet dinner and breakfast were pretty good. The pool area was also very nice. Unfortunately it was the rooms which let this hotel down. They were outdated, with poor lighting, and very little powerpoints. TheTV in the room in Australia would not have worked without a set top box which gives you an idea of how outdated the room was. The thing that annoyed us the most (as we are on our honeymoon) was we had booked a double room not twin singles, the hotel apparently only has about 4 double rooms and they had been booked out and they therefore couldn't give us another room. This hotel would be ideal for families.

The ruins are simply magical and to walk where so many figures in history have walked is an amazing experience. A good guide will explain to you the history, stories and legends associated with each section of Olympia and the truth is just as wonderful to listen to as the legends. We simply loved this place. The ticket includes a visit to the museum as well. Make sure to visit it as it houses the artifacts taken from the archaeological grounds of olympia. The middle room with all the massive marble figurines from the temple of Zeus is worth it all on its own.

Rooms were modern and new, not brilliantly decorated. Bathroom was terrible, there was no shower holder. I had to get my husband to hold the shower up for me to wash my hair. Water ended up going everywhere as the tiny shower screen didn't really screen adequately. By the time we finished we had towels all over the floor to stop us slipping. Others in our tour group said the same thing. If it had been for more than one night it would have been very annoying. As it was for one night it was kind of comical. Room had a nice little balcony, but no view. Pool area looked really nice. Room came with aircon and free wifi. Buffet dinner was terrible and the buffet breakfast ok. View from breakfast area was brilliant.

It has a lot to look at and has some very interesting and important items for the Muslim people. The buildings are all very beautiful always remember to look up at the ceilings.

It was very clearly mentioned that we would like to have the sizzler without onion-garlic, still it was served!! After finding a few pieces of sliced onions - on the first self serve, we had to ask it to change it. They changed - BUT NO SORRY or APOLOGY! It was not at all mentioned by the Bearer or the Captain, which is very insulting. My experience to a class restaurant like this states that - If they make a mistake, they apologize and also the dish is @ the house cost. Here I did not find any... Surprising but true. I will avoid to go to this restaurant now because of this "unfavorable service".

Everything was managed by SOTC - KUONI Travels. The checkin procedure much smoother then expected. The cleanliness of the hotel is awesome and the staff really helpful. You will find different nationality staff members working, which had one thing in common - The Universal Language of SMILE. The security performs its duty just perfect. The rooms are well matintained and so are the accessories supplied. The free tea-coffee bar and water are the part of the regular supply. The morning breakfast had Jain Food which was made as good by Indian cooks. Lot of different restaurants and bars are the part of this property. The Location is on the main road which makes accesability for you to any place through - Metro Rail, Bus or Taxi manageable.

Ideally priced. The staff is considering customers very lightly. The hotel is Free wifi... But the connections are too poor that you will fall asleep. Most of the time connections are not reconnected once you leave the hotel. Surprisingly they do not understand Jain Food or Food without atleast onion & garlic. SORRY is used a lo.. which actually looses its value. The breakfast is good but yes.. if you are jain settle with fruits and idli to make your day.

The building is quite old and the service is good. It is hard to find a trained staff but with respect to the charges of the room and food its reasonable and acceptable. He was able to make some jain food according to the taste which very clearly states that they are interested in Customers.

I was attending a Business Conference all the times and I was served only 1 Vegetable - Paneer. Do Jains only eat Paneer??? That's what this people think! Jains also eat Peas (Mutter), Cauliflower, Lady Finger etc. which was never known. No Soup for Jain except Tomato. For which to serve they were very resistant. We also eat Sweet Corn Vegetable which has peas & french beans. (A dream I think) which they could make if they want Jain People visiting their Hotel. Next time any conference - I would like to skip this hotel for food and have food somewhere else.

However - It looks that it would be very disturbing as its on the highway - but once you enter the hotel you hardly listen any horn or traffic noise.

The remote resort has good cottages but less maintained if you are passing by guest. The taste of jain food is excellent - for punjabi and chinese dishes. The place is a self sufficient and you would enjoy the silence. You can enjoy if you are in a group - However if you are alone you can surely spiritiually feel next to god.

It said you "buy 2 main dishes and you get 1 free". Looks attractive as the Restaurant serves all types of food like Punjabl, Italian and Continental. To the surprise - Before ordering I checked on a couple of dishes to which they refused that they have only put on selected items which will be made available! I have been using this discount cards for a number of hotels in Vadodara, However this was a surprising experience for this restaurant.

You feel relaxed with positive energy the moment you enter the hotel or enjoy the scenic view from the open air restaurant.

The rooms and the bathrooms are very well done and maintained. Free Tea/Coffee facility in the room helps you save time. Ample space to put your things and though its on the main road - you hardly hear the horn honking! Jain Food was available on request which was very well made. Quality & Quantity of Food was reasonable. In-house Discotheque is converted into banquet hall so you miss on room guest benefits.

Just entering the hall and sit for few minutes, see the architecture, don't make noise! Thats all !!!!I think some meaningful activities will make this Bahai Lotus temple more worth and attractive. Kind attention in this regard will be highly obliged.

Hot tea served at 6 am. Room view is excellent as it is located just opposite to the Puri beach n Bay of Bengal. Food in restaurant was good...though the room rent was a bit higher and food rate as well...but it was affordable by upper middle class family members like us. During our stay we observed that the owners son is very much careful about the maintenance issues and he personally takes care of everything ...! Probably this is one of the reasons...that Victoria Club hotel is still maintaining good reputation. We had some minor problem with the Air-conditioner. When complained, immediately they sent electrician and based on electricians report they changed one of our booked rooms and for which we didn't even take any effort to request reception to change our room. Thats called service.

Rooms are almost similar as they show in the photos. But...we slept at night with sunglass and covering face by clothes as white dusts were falling from the ceiling which is really bad for eyes. Roof top night view is awesome. Basically it is not a hotel, rather it is a residence of some local family who are allowing you to stay in their residence against money.Too much expensive...Rs. 3000 is too much for such an accommodation and food....don't ask me...they charged Rs. 350 for small 3 pieces of mutton which were not tasty. Food is expensive...an old lady who i guess is the owner of the house takes care of the business. Though,,,our experience was a bit exceptional due to such an excellent night view of Jaisalmer city from roof. They provided us guide to visit the city who was a local young man ...we got tired by walking in the whole trip. At last asked for assistance to go to Sam dune and the driver cum took us by a soft top roof jeep and later on we understood they have link with the local camel riders and we didnt avail the service as it was too expensive. Didnt get any cooperation from the guide's end.Atlast...the location of the hotel is in Jaisalmer fort...you wont get any bell boy there...neither car goes up...you have to walk all the way up of the fort to reach hotel and then someone will come to pick your luggage...else you have to carry the all your luggage by yourself which will take 10 mins to reach to hotel by narrow dirty lanes.

The reception staff was not very cordial from the beginning though I was lucky to meet the owner during my first visit. But after two years when we visited the hotel once again, we were shocked by the service quality. Specially the restaurant took more than an hour just to provide was 3 plates of Chowmin as we were hungry enough after long drive frm Kolkata to Digha. Moreover the bathroom was not as clean as we found in 2010. Bedsheet condition was also so so. I visited the garden part in the evening and next morning as well and didn't find the same Greenland Inn as it was before. Moreover, as mentioned before, we didnt find the cordiality in reception staff voice when wanted to visit this year (2014) and wanted to make booking over phone by transferring room booking amount by instant money transfer in their bank a/c and it sounded like they are less interested about guests. This time though we wanted to book Greenland Inn as it was a bit known to us...but later in view of the previous experience and less cordiality of the hotel reception staff, we decided to book a different hotel nearby and finally booked room at another Hotel and our experience was good. Hope Greenland Inn shall recover from whatever problems they are having now and will be more cordial in this hospitality industry.

Last June, me and my newly married wife alongwith one of my university friend and his newly married wife planned for a weekend getaway. Rail ticket was easily available and made hotel room booking over phone by transferring required money to the Rajeet hotel's Bank account instantly. As the hotel location was not very clear to me, I made a phone call from train to the Hotel Official Mr. Tapas to send a car at Digha Station to pick us. The car was at station accordingly though Rs. 200 they charged for less than 3 minutes drive. As AC Deluxe room was not available, we had to stay in Non AC rooms for the first night. The experience was not too good as water was dropping on our face from the ceiling. The official informed us, due to high guest pressure, they couldn't turn their ACs' off for last 2 months as a result NON AC room condition is like this. We accepted their explanation.The hotel staffs behave was very good. They were very much cordial and we liked their warm hospitality. No doubt some minor problems will be there if the hotel is so packed. Next morning we got the AC rooms and shifted there. The rooms were good enough with a small balcony. We were very much comfortable and room service and house keeping department was good enough. The in-house restaurant of the hotel is small but well equipped and very much prompt in service. Taste was good and restaurant staffs were very much helpful. We both the couples appreciated their effort to make guests satisfied. We still gossip and laugh among friends on their COMPLEMENTARY PAPAD supply during our last lunch at hotel. But...in our next Digha visits, we will stay at Rajeet Hotel definitely as their service was very good and the hotel is located very close to the beach...though no sea views from room. In my travel agency, I have started suggesting my customers to stay at Rajeet Hotel in Digha and 3 of my guests have already visited the hotel though the hotel is not associated with us. Good luck to Hotel Rajeet and hope it will improve service quality in near future.

Went on a Monday late afternoon but still really packed! Got a seat right away at the bar table which is first-come-first-served and found quite a number of solo diner like me there. Tried 3 dishes: fried pig ear, pork belly and Sicilian iris, all were very delicious! Too bad that I was alone and couldn't try more dishes... went back with a friend on Thursday night around 8pm, and it was crazily packed. We were told the wait time is 1.5 hours... so didn't get the chance to eat there again, but would definitely love to go back when I'm in Chicago again.

Although it's a bit hard to see they get onto the shore as there's only certain area in the stand you can see it more clearly. The rest of the spots was too far away, and you are not allowed to stand up, so makes it even harder for short person like me... Since there's only a limited time to stay there as we were in a tour and need to catch the bus back, suggest to go check out the shop and eat first. When the penguin are already coming to shore for a while around 7:30pm and people start to leave the stand, you can then walk to the stand and get the best spot in the first row. And on your way there you can also see lots of penguin walking to their home too!

However, on the tour day, since the pick up was late, so I called the Activity Tour office to confirm the pick up time and location, only to be told they don't have my booking nor received my payment. The CS person, didn't seem to try to resolve this at all. I told her I got the voucher, and my credit card was charged for 2 people, but the only thing she said was "No, we don't have your booking or your payment. The tour was full long time ago so you couldn't go onto the tour"! What pissed me off the most is, when I asked her then what can I do now? She replied with a blunt "nothing you can do"?! I paid more than USD200 and that's the service I got? When I insisted her to do something, she finally said she will talk to her manager, and put me on hold for more than 10 min until I hang up. In the end, it was our driver and tour guide Nigel, who saw my paper voucher and decided to let us board since there are spaces in the car!! Really a big thanks to Nigel. He is a good guide and try his best to accommodate everyone's needs. The tour experience itself was great to.o. I'm just very upset by the attitude of the CS person.

Staffs are accommodative and friendly, and food is good. Room is clean and bed is comfortable. Just a few cons. Electricity is only available several hours in the morning and in the evening. And as most of the tourist here need to charge the phones, cameras, gopro etc after a long day of photogenic safari, this is a challenging to have all device fully charged for everyone. But I heard the other camps in the area is the same too as they all use power generator for electricity. And the water from the tap smell super metallic...

We were welcomed by the maasai chief and tribe with dances and got to mingle with them. Then we walked with the chief to his village camp site and spent an incredible night with him and the warriors. They slaughtered and grilled a goat as dinner for us, shared their special alcohol, and had a fun party time with lots of singing and dancing. At night, we were guided by the warriors to star gaze, and slept on a comfortable leaf bed that smell really good. This is an experience where you can't get anywhere else. Highly recommended to spend a night here.

Room was clean and well equipped. Breakfast offer a good variety of cold and hot dish. Service was great. They even offer a little cute incentive for you to not having house keeping for environmental reason. Anyone who's curious like me would be tempted to try!Just one small thing. When we ask the front desk is there any restaurant around that is still opening at 8:30pm, the staff said yes and pointing to the lobby restaurant. When we asked again if there are other restaurants around, he bluntly said no, but I remember I read from the review that there is a Romanian restaurant just 5 min away! In the end, we went out to try our luck, and found that the Romanian restaurant is just 2 min away from the hotel and was still opening! Other than that staff, the rest of the hotel staffs were really helpful.

You can climb up the dark and narrow stoney stairs to the top, where you can have a great view of the surrounding area. However, the slope down to the main street can be a bit tricky in winter as it got really slippery with the ice and snow. It was a real challenge for most of us down the slope!

Surprising we were the only person who had dinner there! We had a 4-course meal for €54 each. The food was OK, but the portion is HUGE! The setting was romantic, and it's fun to find that our hot dishes melted the table top! Towards the end of our dinner, we found our coats got wet from the melting table and our plates left a circle hole on the table top! They were then recovered by the staffs later at night, but we can still see the mark.It was an interesting and special experience.
saruwhite|7F34255A6BCA24823B2E1F083AEBE626|Hotel|Sibiu: Hotel of Ice|3| “What an experience!”|review_449846723|This is a once in a life time experience. Considering you were sleeping in an ice room, on the ice bed, in a mountain isolated from the chalet while it was -17 outside with blizzards. You were given access to a room in the chalet before 9pm (when you are able to move to your room as it's closed for public visit), where you can store your luggage and take a shower if needed. Then you will have to stay in the ice hotel until 7:30am at least when the chalet will be opened again. In case you need to use the toilet, you will need to go to the chalet before 10pm (which is 300m away) or the cable car station (200m away) after. Consider the weather outside, I wonder who will walk alone in the dark to use the toilet though...Before booking, I checked the hotel website and it mentioned the room and sleeping bag will be warm enough that you only need to wear normal sleeping clothes. However, in the end we were all wearing full gear to sleep. And the morning walk back to the chalet was a real challenge too! The visibility was so low that you can nearly see anything in 10m, and the snow was like 1m high with strong wind and snow. You couldn't even see the light that tells you the location of the chalet...The communication from the hotel could be better. I emailed the hotel a few times before the trip asking about transportation etc. But I either have to email them a few times before I got a respond, or simply very slow in replying. Upon arriving Balea Lake, we were waiting in line to get on the cable car (which is the only mean to go up the mountain in winter) for an hour before a staff noticed is with the luggage and said hotel guest can actually skip the line... Then, after arriving the top, no signs or anything to direct us to the check-in place, and of course wr didn't know we have to go to the chalet. Sp you were left walking in the snow alone, trying to get someone to ask for the way. Also, no one from the chalet told us we need to bring the sleeping bag during check-in, and so another couple and us were left arriving our room at 10pm without sleeping bags, and had to call the chalet to bring them over. There were hotel guests who just slept in other people's room instead of their assigned one! The couple who arrived the ice hotel with us found someone was already sleeping in their room...Lastly, regarding the transportation to the cable car station, the hotel can arrange taxi pickup from several cities, but in the end I found a cheaper option to go from Brasov directly to the cable car station for €70.Overall speaking, the experience is special and memorable, but the hotel management needs some improvement on several points.

Meet the driver and jump on the bus. The bus drives across the road where you offload and load onto the ice bus. Low geared and large tyres for driving on the ice. There is a steep decline before arriving on the glacier. Hop off and walk around. Be sure to follow the guides directions about safety. Don't walk behind the buses and don't cross the stream as the glacier is unsafe. Spent all the time exploring the glacier.

The falls were in full flight with the melting snow. The roaring of the water over the falls could be heard for miles. The falls. Drop off in a number of places along the canyon until it drops down into a wider part of the river. Well worth hiking along the trails beside the falls.
firemanwal|B1CE3C5A76581D158DF37542342F39CF|Attractions|Jasper: Maligne Canyon|5| “ Breathtaking”|review_377129375|Absolutely magnificent. Words can hardly describe this place. The ice had mostly melted by the time we got there. The water was rushing and roaring through the canyon. Lots of smaller waterfalls were created along the way. We also hiked to all 6 bridges that traverse the canyon. About 6klms run trip. Can be dangerous in places especially when wet. But such good fun.

Amazing feeling walking on the ice and the history involved. Of course it was snowing and very cold at the same time but didn't make any difference. An enjoyable experience.

Close to lots of shops and restaurants. The room was clean and tidy and large enough to walk around. On the second floor facing the restaurant and a corridor. Noise was not a factor. The only complaint is that we couldn't open the windows for fresh air and the room was dark even with the lights on. There was no central ceiling lights. Just desk lamps. It always appeared dark. The staff were great especially the girls in reception.

No noise and not far from the centre of town. You could walk anywhere within a few minutes. There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms, but outside reception was a tea/coffee maker where you could help yourself 24 hours a day. There was also a pool and spa available.

The girls inside seemed to running around like a chook with it's head cut off. There seemed to be no organization about the seating arrangements. Eventually, it was sorted and we were seated.The service was initially good, but then we had to wait awhile for the food. The food again was more fast food rather than good food. Again everything was fatty or covered in cheese and everything comes with fries. How hard is it to make a salad.

The cave has been built over with a tourist centre and the hot springs closed off to visitors. The walk into the cave is via smooth concrete tunnels to a hot spring. It has been done to protect the snail that lives in the water. There is a historical story line in the visitor centre.

First class service all the way. The Bistro was disappointing with a lack of choices on the menu and aimed more at fast food. To get into the main restaurants you had to book ahead. Bit hard when you arrive during the day and are not aware of the situation. The room was nice but small. hardly any room to move. Have been in cheaper Hotels with much larger rooms and just as nice.

Try the Hophead IPA beer and the Grapefruit Radler Beer. The Pizzas are to die for as they use the left over grains from the brewing in the Pizza dough.

It is 4 times larger than the one we had at the Fairmont in Lake Louise for a fraction of the price. King size bed, bathroom, large walk in robe for clothing and cases with a second washroom. Large TV, 2 reclining chairs, a couch, a small kitchenette and lots of space to walk around. The price was also surprising at $179. Ask for room 309.

We decided recently to give it another try and were very pleasantly surprised. The food and service were very good - can recommend both the mussels (a very generous entrée size serve) and the prawn wonton stack. It is also byo wine, which is always good. Now that we have rediscovered the place, will definitely visit again.

KateSydney|3E417CD57D7DD0282D59987BF5F5ECDB|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|5| “A fun, fun day”|review_480408082|What a great day we had at Universal Studios. Our large extended family (8 adults, 7 children, ages ranging from 3 to 65!) all enjoyed it immensely. The rides were so much fun and the Waterworld Show was really good. There are not a lot of rides for little kids but they enjoyed those they could go on. Those of us who liked the more exciting rides were in their element! We arrived around 9.45 and left at 5.15. A TIP: The express pass is a MUST! Yes, it does make the day rather expensive but we did not have to wait for more than 5 mins for any of the rides. The waiting time for some of the rides was 80 mins. By having the express pass we were able to go on all the rides and everyone was happy! We bought the express pass which gave you one turn on each ride - there really is not enough time to do each ride more than once. This cost was $50 as we went on a Saturday, if you visit on weekdays it is $30. Such a great place to visit.

KateSydney|3E417CD57D7DD0282D59987BF5F5ECDB|Attractions|Singapore: Night Safari|5| “Great!”|review_480406047|A visit to the night safari is a must when in Singapore. It is great for all ages and very well organised. There can be a bit of a wait to board the train, but the line moves pretty quickly. The animal show is also good. We booked the 7.15 arrival time, went to the animal show first and then boarded the train for the trip around the zoo. We were a large extended family group with small children and this timing was perfect for us. The night safari can be reached by train and bus but if you have young children taxi/uber is a better option as it is quite a distance from the city. We purchased a park hopper plus pass which is a very reasonable way to visit the night safari, the zoo, the river safari and the Jurong bird park.
KateSydney|3E417CD57D7DD0282D59987BF5F5ECDB|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Zoo|5| “Great day at the Zoo”|review_480405297|We had a great day at the zoo. Our large extended family (8 adults and 7 children, aged 3 - 9) all enjoyed it. It was very hot and stormy, as is usual in Singapore, so make sure to take hats, umbrellas, sunscreen and plenty of water. The zoo is very well laid out and easy to walk around - most of it is on level ground. There is also a train to take you to various stations, where you can get off and discover the animals in that particular area. The water park is great and a wonderful way for the kids to cool down. Make sure to take swimmers for the children (although, if necessary, you can purchase from the shop nearby). KFC is also located at the waterpark, so if you time your visit you can have lunch and the kids can cool down all at the same time. We purchased a park hopper plus pass which is a very reasonable way to visit the night safari, zoo, river safari and bird park (we did not get to the bird park and it was still much cheaper than purchasing individual tickets to each venue). The river safari is next to the zoo and both can be visited on the same day. It is possible to get to the zoo by train and bus but if you have young children I would suggest going by taxi/uber as the kids will be tired by the time of the return journey.
KateSydney|3E417CD57D7DD0282D59987BF5F5ECDB|Attractions|Singapore: Kranji War Memorial|5| “ANZAC Dawn Service”|review_479638733|Very moving and special experience at the ANZAC Day Dawn Service. This War Memorial is very well looked after and all the headstones and monuments are surrounded by flowers and shrubs. My uncle was killed during the Fall of Singapore in Feb 1942, so this was an emotional visit for me and a wonderful way to remember him and all those who fought in the many wars over the last century. Definitely a must visit, even for the young, at any time of the year but if you do happen to be there on the 25th April, very special.
KateSydney|3E417CD57D7DD0282D59987BF5F5ECDB|Hotel|Singapore: Somerset Bencoolen|3| “Good serviced apartments”|review_479637913|Our large family group (eight adults and seven children) spent 9 nights at Somerset Bencoolen. We had four apartments - one 1 bedroom deluxe and three 2 bedroom premier. The apartments are very roomy and most amenities are provided. I had requested an extra bed in each of the 2 bedroom apartments to cater for an extra child - unfortunately these were not set up on our arrival and there were only two available so the extra child in the third 2 bedroom apartment was provided with a mattress on the floor, which was not very comfortable. The second bedroom in each of the 2 bedroom apartments has a queen bed - I am not sure why two single beds are not provided; a much better option for families when small children may not wish to share a bed. There were a few problems with the apartments (eg broken hairdryer, shower head not working properly, air conditioner not running well) but these were quickly fixed upon request. The property is a little run down and could do with an overall freshening up. Breakfast was plentiful with a variety of food - as with most serviced residences this was different each day. The pool area is great after a hot day and we used it each afternoon - there is a large lap pool, a kid's pool and a spa. I think the construction on the road is nearing completion and this will make a big difference to the overall appearance of the apartment block. The staff were friendly and helpful. Somerset Bencoolen is in a great spot - walking distance to many tourist areas and close to a metro station. Ubers and taxis are very cheap, especially during the daytime. It is very reasonably priced for accommodation in Singapore and if you become a member of Ascott Online Advantage there is a 10% discount. Notwithstanding, the minor problems, we would stay there again as it is in a great spot at a good price.

The Kowloon Food Tour with Danny was very good, he took us to places we had not visited before and the restaurants where we ate had delicious and varied food. He was very informative, not only about food, but also about many aspects of Hong Kong. I recommend this tour.

I travelled on the train from Hong Kong to Shanghai in February 2017. I was very happy with the booking procedures. I was notified on a regular basis regarding ticketing and any updates. The process was very easy and the price for the service and delivery to my hotel very reasonable. The train tickets were waiting for me at my hotel upon my arrival in Hong Kong. Everything was very clearly marked at Hung Hom railway station and I did not have any difficulty finding the right waiting area. The train itself was very comfortable with a private toilet in the cabin. The cabin was a little dirty and could do with a really good clean. The meals were good and there was no problem getting a seat at both dinner and breakfast. I would definitely recommend this train trip as a way to reach Shanghai from Hong Kong.

A three hour, easy, level walk through Shanghai Old Town with Peter, a Dane who has lived in Shanghai for 20 years. He is very knowledgeable but also does not mind admitting when he does not know something or has passed on the wrong information! We visited so many little, narrow streets, went into small alleyways and upstairs to communal kitchens and bathrooms. A really wonderful insight into how so many of the older Chinese and young people from the country (who are looking for work) live in this modern city. Definitely a must!

As we did not want to have to take bags on and off the train, we decided to just go on the train from the city to the airport and return for the fun of the trip. We had hoped to get the train before 10.45 am as trains between 9.00 am and 10.45 am travel at a faster speed but unfortunately just missed the 10.45 by a few minutes. Nevertheless, the trip was great and the train travelled at 300 kmh for most of the time. The best part was when it passed a train going in the opposite direction - the train went by in a flash! Takes only 8 mins to get to/from the airport so if you are prepared to take your luggage a very fast journey indeed.

The shopping outside the garden is always very busy but there are lots of interesting buildings and perhaps a few bargains at the shops.

The Bund promenade is a delightful walk along the river, but can get very busy, especially at weekends. Night lights along The Bund wonderful.
KateSydney|3E417CD57D7DD0282D59987BF5F5ECDB|Hotel|Shanghai: Les Suites Orient, Bund Shanghai|5| “Wonderful hotel”|review_464381563|What a great hotel! The room was a good size (Shanghai Deluxe River View) and worth the extra money and the bathroom was very large. Both were beautifully appointed, very comfortable bed and large fluffy towels. A stunning view from both the bedroom and the bathroom - especially at night, with the lights on both the Pudong side and The Bund. I sat for ages just watching the barges and ferries going up and down the river! The breakfast was very varied and delicious and there was plenty of seating. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Happy hour, starting at 5.30, provided a selection of drinks with the first one free. The ferry to the Pudong side of the river was just across the road, it was an easy 10-15 min walk to Yu Yuen and an easy 15-20 min walk to Nanjing Road. An added bonus for us was the Catholic Church just a few minutes away. I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here if I am ever lucky enough to visit wonderful Shanghai again.

It was our first visit to a Michelin Star restaurant - the food was very, very good but also very, very pricey. The whole experience was let down by the poor service and the restaurant itself. As we were staying at the hotel, we breakfasted in the same area each morning - this then turned into the Celebrity Cuisine Restaurant in the evening - nothing changed; same tablecloths, same lighting, same china etc. We did really enjoy the food but were rather disappointed with the whole Michelin Star experience.
KateSydney|3E417CD57D7DD0282D59987BF5F5ECDB|Attractions|Hong Kong: Ma On Shan Promenade|5| “Great day visit”|review_463914591|We decided to hop on a local bus to any destination and ended up at Ma On Shan. It was a delightful place to visit and walk along the promenade, although we did not have enough time to walk the full length. Not many tourists here (if any) and it was great to get away from the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong city. The bus ride was about 50 mins through very interesting areas on both Hong Kong Island and Kowloon - unfortunately I cannot remember the number of the bus, but we caught it from the express bus station near Central Railway Station.

A "tourist" market, but great fun and plenty of bargains available. Restaurants along the waterfront provide a good meal (and a place for my husband to have a beer while I shop!). The local bus trip across to Stanley is a great way to see the beautiful beach areas on Hong Kong Island.

It is a delightful hotel, lovely oriental decorations and everything was provided in the room. The room was not huge and the bathroom did not have a lot of room but overall was quite big by Hong Kong standards. We had a harbour view room, which gave quite a good view of the harbour through the numerous tall buildings in front of the hotel. Breakfast was very good and the food fresh - not a wide range but more than adequate, with eggs, dumplings, bacon, pastries, fruits etc. The area around the hotel is very interesting, with local areas and street markets, but is also quite close to many western restaurants. It is about a 15-20 min walk to Central Station and the ferry pier and 5 min to the trams.

The food is very good and always fresh. It is not a huge place and it is a good idea to make a reservation, especially at peak holiday times. It can get rather noisy as any time I have been every table has been occupied.

The room was very comfortable and modern, the bathroom spotless (though it was a little small) and the breakfasts delicious. The owners are very friendly and helpful and love to have a chat. It is the little things that set this b & b above other b & b's - slices of home-made cake in room on arrival, pieces of fudge as a welcome, bottled water provided each day, flowers on the dressing table, docking station, wine glasses and bottle opener, plenty of maps and information on the area, everything spotless and well-cared for. Parking provided just around the corner. A very easy walk into town, where there are some great restaurants. A definite gem.

Room was very comfortable and the water was hot. We ate at the restaurant for dinner and the food was very good and service with a smile. Breakfast was also delicious. We managed to get parking on site without any trouble. The hotel is not clearly sign-posted and we did have trouble locating it. Bourton-on-the-Water is a delightful place to visit - very busy during the day but very peaceful in the evening when the day time crowds depart.

As it was summer holidays and Barmouth is a beach resort, the area was very busy, with many families soaking up the sun and making the most of the warm weather. The hotel room was rather small, but the beds were comfortable and the water was hot. Breakfast was good with lots of choice. Parking onsite was great. Outside tables were a perfect place to enjoy a nice cold beer/gin and tonic at the end of the day. watching the magnificent sunset.

Could not fault a thing. Vicki @ check-in was wonderful. No problems what so ever, a breeze, friendly, asked what we had planed and offered some ideas. Food was wonderful, room was large, clean, fresh. Hotel has a bus that leaves for Vivocity every 00:45 & 00:15mins. This will connect you to the MRT. Make sure you purchase your tourist tap & go MRT card upon arrival into Changi airport. Meals were all great - even including Gluten free options for my partner. This hotel really goes the extra step to ensure the customer is 'at home'. Sentosa is a 10 min ride to Vivocity, so keep in mind its off the mainland to get around. Peacocks that roam the property and somewhat relaxing to watch. I will be back to enjoy the serenity.

Checkin was fine. Anastasia went out of her way to let us know what was on around the hotel and in Hyde Park. Big problem is the slowness of the passenger lifts. Almost full house and ques to get in and out of the lifts. Make sure you check your bill (nervous about using the express checkout) as we were billed for 4 items (including beer) in the mini bar - as my partner and I don't drink beer? I am led to believe the hotel is rated as 5 star - but can't really envisage the quality is better than Sofitel. We got a room with a balcony, but fittings are pretty worn. Any piece of stationary, do not disturb signs - ALL worn.. The slamming doors in the hallway is frustrating also. Breakfast presentation needs to be reviewed. Latte - not good, seats - worn and dirty. Overhead music over buffet too loud. Sorry but can't justify coming back... even with a balcony...

On our last night I sank 5 of them. Food is top notch too. Could not fault. The signature green curry chicken pizza was my favourite. The guys had done a refurb since our last visit and looks great. Well done guys! We are definitely coming back when we return to the Shangri-La later this year. Everything ticks the box, food, drinks, laid back house music, ambience, lighting & staff that are smiling and polite. We dined here almost every night.

(first laneway after MdDonalds and the Irish Pub). There is a large lightbox overhanging the alley with Arabia. Very quiet, but looks like its a family business so they are very attentive with broken english. The kebabs are smoking in taste. Butter chicken was small in portion but big in taste. Architecture is over the top, which was great. People passing by were keen after seeing us eat out the front. Happy to go back. Even got a return 10% card. Why not try the Hookah pipes on offer?

Stuart C|790BE3B77A4DAEB9467EBD4F9039B4F4|Hotel|Singapore: Village Residence Clarke Quay by Far East Hospitality|3| “OK Stay, Property is tired and in need of overhaul/refresh.”|review_480295014|My family & i stayed in a two bedroom apartment for seven nights in April.Firstly the staff at the property are very friendly & Helpful.The Hotel & our room was clean but looks tired and requires an overhaul.The Lounge area had a 3 seater settee & single chair, TV & Stereo, Telephone & a Handy Mobile phone with free calls to the UK & Internet, there was also a dining table and Large fridge freezer in the room.The double room also had views over to Clarke Quay comfortable bed, TV, Plenty of Hanging space & Safe.The Twin room was very dark due to the small window (That looked at a brick wall) being blocked by the wardrobe.The kitchen was well equipped and had a very useful washing machine.The Bathroom was clean but not user friendly, the door splits in two which blocks the sliding door to the toilet (which leaked) on one side & the sink to the other.The apartment was very comfortable, good WIFI & Air Conditioning and a great base for visiting Singapore however we did share the apartment with hundreds of little Ants and a bad smell from the drain in the kitchen.The pool area is lovely, you would not know your on the forth floor due to all of the shrubbery, a great place to relax/swim after a hard days sight seeing.Are Breakfast was available during the week in the Business Centre next Door and comprised of Juices, Tea, Coffee, Cereals, Pastries, Scrambled eggs, sausage, Bread to toast, Fruit & Yogurts.Great location for Clark Quay which is a short walk & Close to both China Town & Clark Quay MTR. I would stay here again if visiting Singapore due to its location, Staff and value for money.
Stuart C|790BE3B77A4DAEB9467EBD4F9039B4F4|Hotel|Incheon: Grand Hyatt Incheon|4| “Good convenient Airport Hotel.”|review_480285220|My Family and i stayed at the Hyatt Inchon Hotel for one night prior to our early flight the next morning.The hotel has a regular shuttle bus from the Airport terminal that runs every 15 minutes and is free.Check in was a little slow but ok and we were given 2 rooms next to each other but not connecting.The Hotel its self is very Luxurious & the rooms were clean & well appointed, very comfortable beds with crisp linen, TV with plenty of international channels and Flight information, in room safe, iron & Ironing board, Tea, Coffee and a large bottle of complimentary water, comfortable seat & foot stool to relax on.The bathroom had a separate walk in Bath/Rain shower with all of the usual soaps and lotions, the toilet had plenty of functions which we did not use.We did not use the restaurants during our stay so could not comment.The hotel its self is located in an area that looks to be expanding, several restaurants & bars but not a lot else to do.We walked into the airport for a coffee which took 20 minutes along a dedicated foot path.The room rate is quite expensive however I would recommend this hotel for an overnight stay prior or post flights
Stuart C|790BE3B77A4DAEB9467EBD4F9039B4F4|Hotel|Seoul: Courtyard Seoul Namdaemun|5| “Fantastic Hotel”|review_480273781|This is a fantastic Hotel, from pre arrival, during the visit through to Departure.I booked this hotel for my 5 night stay in Seoul just after it opened last year, i requested 2 rooms on a high floor (1 Twin & 1 Double) with breakfast in MoMo's.2 days before our trip i was contacted by Mr Sun Lee from the hotel, he recognised my email address and offered a Corporate Rate and included access to the executive 22nd floor for breakfast and snacks throughout the day.He also advised that he would arrange my requested rooms.On walking uptown the main entrance we were greeted by the friendly Concierge who directed us to the check in desk on the first floor.Check in was very fast and everything requested was in place, we were given two rooms with a connecting door on the 16th floor, the rooms were fantastic, ultra comfortable beds, huge TV with plenty of international channels, Fridge, mini bar, large wardrobe with safe, ironing board, dressing gowns, slippers etc.The bathroom had a superb rain shower with Soaps, tooth brushes etc, hairdryer and plenty of soft towels.The executive floor was also a bonus, great views, fantastic food and very friendly staff who were always very helpful, we only used the happy hour once during the visit due to our busy schedule but again the food was of excellent quality.The hotel is 5 minutes walk from the Namdaemun Subway station and 10 minutes from Seoul Station and very close to the N Seoul Tower and central to the night markets and shooping.Again this hotel is fantastic & comes highly recommended, thank you to all of the staff especially Mr Sun Lee for making our holiday one of the best ever.

Brilliant.Flour Field is a fantastic Stadium, Plenty of free parking, Loads of food outlets, fantastic atmosphere & as a newbie to Baseball everyone happy to answer my questions.Thanks Greenville Drive, I really enjoyed my visit.

MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): Chili's|4| “Great service, tasty food but a bit to heavy for me”|review_511841793|Chilli's has very good service - right from the time of entering the place to serving, the staff takes extra effort to help you out. I had the margarita bruscetta and it was good, so were the nachos. However, I expected the food to be light and easy on the stomach with more vegetables and less fat. In this aspect, chilli's disappointed me.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): Kettle & Keg|4| “Nice ambience and fresh food”|review_510433221|Kettle & Keg has a lovely ambience (we sat outside because the inside is a little noisy), and great service. One feels welcome by the staff and they are eager to help and take note of any special requests or allergies. Serving sizes are big - we ordered one farm vegetable pizza between my husband and myself and it was enough for us. We also had a kit kat milkshake which was okay - I did not like the palm oil based cream on top it. Nonetheless, overall, I liked Kettle & Keg and will visit again.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): Bombay to Barcelona Library Cafe|4| “Staff make it exceptional”|review_507426473|This little cafe in Marol has wonderful staff that go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Their friendly smiles make you feel welcome, and they are the USP of this place. Food wise, I had the zucchini with mushroom which was good, along with the tomato chutney sandwich which was really good as well. My husband had a chicken sandwich which he liked. One negative of this place is that the food is a little too buttery and heavy for me. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my visit here and recommend it!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): Grandmama's Cafe|3| “Very disappointed with the food (Juhu branch) ”|review_507424468|Firstly, the positives : Grandmama's Cafe has a beautiful cozy ambience, making you feel like you're in a cafe in Europe. The staff are really good, and service is prompt and done with a smile. But, The food is really sad. The tomato soup was bland and boring. I ordered the pumpkin ravioli and it was raw. We then ordered a pasta which was nothing to write home about either. Based on these three dishes, we decided not to have a dessert and just leave. Which is a shame because I really wanted this place to be really good because I love the ambience so much!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Panchgani: Cheese Factory|4| “Good food and good ambience”|review_499920390|I visited this place with a bunch of friends in November 2016, at around 9:30 at night. We had fries, pizzas and cheese balls and all the food was decent. The staff was very helpful too, despite it being so late. I cannot comment on the "factory tour" because I did not do it since I reached so late. I would like to see the cheese factory when I visit again.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Dehradun District: Purkal Stree Shakti Samiti|5| “Beautiful products for household needs!”|review_498139535|Purkal Stree Shakti has gorgeous quilts, bedsheets, pillow cases, toiletry bags, tea holders, gloves, kurtas and now women's tops (though women's tops were limited in design when I visited since they are a new product). I was blown away by the quality of fabric, detailed embroidery and beautiful color co-ordination used to make products so appealing that I felt like buying so much right away! All my friends loved the stuff I bought, as did my husband :). The fact that this NGO supports underprivileged women makes it even more inspiring - one wonders how much talent these women have to make such lovely products despite their trying circumstances. I would love to visit Purkal Stree Shakti again, and am looking forward to ordering some products from them online.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT)|5| “Reliable, convenient and on time”|review_489739329|The MRT is a great way to travel in Singapore. It's on time, has great outreach across the city and cheaper than other modes of transport here. Singapore is especially prone to traffic jams at some times of the day and the MRT is a great way to beat the traffic. Interchanges may require you to walk a bit between one station and the other, but the interchanges are clean and generally have some good food options, so no complaints. I will definitely depend on the MRT when I'm back in Singapore.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Singapore: Loui’s NY Pizza Parlor|4| “Decent place in Universal Studio Singapore ”|review_489738899|This pizza place is a decent place to eat in universal studios Singapore, which has limited eating options. The pizza slices are large, and while vegetarians can only eat the margarita pizza, it tastes pretty good so no complaints. I remember I had the margarita pizza for lunch and dinner out of lack of options in Universal. For non vegetarians, there are options of different pizzas and desserts too. Kids will enjoy eating here.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): Masala Library|5| “Fabulous, but expensive! ”|review_489738009|Masala Library is an absolute gastronomical experience, especially if you order the preset "chef's tasting menu". This has a preset seven course meal, with soup, salad, three starters, a main course and two desserts. Each dish is unique and well thought of, though it's the desserts that stand apart and are awesome. Having said that, when I visit Masala Library again I will not order this preset menu and will go ala carte because the preset menu is so so filling that you feel like you just cannot eat anymore once the main course arrives. So instead of wasting food, I'd rather go ala carte. The chai ice cream dessert is amazing, and I highly recommend it. The vegetarian dal-rice balls are good, as is the mushroom soufflé mains. I was disappointed with the truffle based dishes because there is hardly any taste of truffles. Overall this place is really good, but be prepared to shell out 5-6k for a meal for two people, which is five star hotel rates. Good for special occasions though.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Singapore: Night Safari|1| “Pathetic way to showcase animals”|review_489080222|I visited the night safari and really really regret it. I felt like the animals are in a most unnatural environment having lights on them at night, and living in these glass cages for display. The animals look drugged to stay where they are to ensure that visitors in the train get a view of them. Given the night time, the view of the animals is not very good either so photography is difficult and you would rather see them in a zoo than here at night. If you love animals and care for animal welfare,this is not the safari you want to see. Avoid it!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Singapore: Cloud Forest|5| “Informative and fun! ”|review_489079278|The cloud forest is an artificially created forest in Gardens by the Bay. You get to see the different types of plants that grow at different heights in tropical forests. I love how they link the issue of climate change with how these forests will change over time. I also love that they explain the initiatives the Gardens by the Bay is taking to use renewable energy and reduce its carbon emissions. Cloud forest has a separate entry ticket in Gardens by the Bay, and I would highly recommend a visit to it for a fun experience walking in the forest like area, surrounded by mist :)
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Flyer|4| “Expensive, but a nice experience”|review_489078352|Singapore flyer is expensive to visit-it was 33 Singapore dollars per head when I visited, for about 45 minutes to an hour on the flyer. A ride on the flyer in evening time makes more sense-I visited at around twilight and while the city looks pretty at night with all the lights, I'm guessing evening time would have clearer view of sights making it more fun. I wouldn't go on this flyer the next time I visit Singapore;its a one time tick mark of a sight in the city. The next time I'd probably visit the top lounge of marina Bay sands to get a view of the city at a cheaper rate :). You can get onto the flyer if you are OK spending 33 dollars per head on it, otherwise try to figure another way to get a nice top view of Singapore.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Botanic Gardens|5| “Beautiful place to relax in nature”|review_489077024|Singapore botanical gardens are huge.. You can easily spend half a day walking around the different sections here. The sections explaining different types of plants were well made and informative and it was enjoyable to walk through them. This park is a good picnic spot too, with huge lawns where you can spread out a blanket and relax. It is close to the metro station - about a five minute walk to the entrance which makes it convenient to reach. Do visit when in Singapore if you have some extra time (I wouldn't recommend this park if you are in Singapore for three days- it would be better to visit Gardens by the Bay then). But if you have some extra time, do visit and you will enjoy the peace and quiet this park offers in the city :)
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Singapore: Ananda Bhavan|5| “Awesome South Indian food! ”|review_489073103|I love love love Ananda Bhavan! I had the rawa dosa and it was superb, as were the chutneys served along with it. My husband had Aloo puri which was lip smacking too, and the lassi was really soothing in the humidity of Singapore. Prices are very reasonable, and if as an Indian, you start missing home, just check into Ananda Bhavan to get a feel of the local Udipi joints in India :).. Do visit and you will surely enjoy! Another bonus is that it serves only vegetarian, which is difficult to find in Singapore.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Mussoorie: A Prakash and Co|5| “Lovely cheese available here”|review_489071430|Prakash has a nice and friendly owner, who gives you the details of the products he is selling. He let's you taste the cheese and jams, which is really sweet. The smoked cheddar cheese is awesome! The owner is a cheese maker and hence has a lot of knowledge about the process and different varieties. The jams are homemade, and since I'm not a fan of jams in general, I won't comment on them due to my bias, though I did buy some for my family back home. My friends bought the peanut butter too and I believe it is made fresh too. Highly recommend a visit to this shop if you are in Landour to see if you want to pick any fresh products!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Singapore: Vespetta Italian Gastro Bar|5| “Fabulous Italian food! ”|review_488793969|Vespetta is conveniently located in Clarke Quay in Singapore. If you get riverside tables, do take them coz it's much nicer to sit by the water and eat :). The margarita pizza is fab, but the truffle pasta is to DIE for! Service is prompt and friendly, and the place has a lovely happening vibe to it. One more thing is that it's vegetarian friendly, which is tough to find in Clarke Quay. Do go for a meal here and you will enjoy!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Singapore: Muchos Mexican Bar & Restaurant|5| “Love love love this place! ”|review_488792184|I had nachos and brownies here, and my husband had chimichangas if my memory serves me right. We loved the food and the service here! It was yummy, with the right spice combinations and was fresh to taste. The ambience is nice and cozy. This place is well located on orchard Street so it's easy to access from the metro station. I would love to visit it again when I go back to Singapore!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Singapore: Dome Cafe|3| “Not worth it”|review_488789135|I visited Dome with my husband for dinner and was disappointed with the quality of food and the prices charged. I had a pizza with some truffle oil, and while it was OK, I found it overpriced. In fact, I find the whole of dempsey hill extremely overhyped-it doesn't have the ambience, character or friendliness that places in Orchard Road have. The entire neighbourhood shuts down early, so if you want dinner at 10pm ,it may not be possible. Anyway, if you visit this place, be ready to pay high prices for food you could get elsewhere for a cheaper rate.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Mumbai (Bombay): Mudraa Spa|3| “Powai branch - would not visit again”|review_488787793|I visited this place recently with a bunch of friends. The spa session was OK, but the unfriendly nature of the staff was annoying. We asked the staff if there is a steam room, and they said no, there isn't one while there was indeed a steam room present. When questioned why they didn't let us know, we got a rude answer from a lady saying 'come again n sit there the whole day, it's free'. We really did not pay good money to get attitude from the staff. The masseuse when starting the massage session by cleaning our feet was also particularly clinical and did not do anything to make guests feel welcome to the spa. I would not visit Mudraa again and will try another spa next time.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Dehradun District: Muse The Art Gourmet|4| “Very average food”|review_488783762|Muse has a decent ambience but the food is not upto the mark. We ordered khow suey which we had to return because it didn't look like khow suey at all. The Lasagna soup tasted like it was too processed and not made of fresh tomatoes. The Chinese noodles were extremely bland and the schezwan sauce with them didn't taste authentic. I would not visit this place again.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Mussoorie: Lal Tibba|5| “Must walk to Lal Tibba from Char Dukaan”|review_488782374|The walk from Char dukaan to Lal Tibba is BEAUTIFUL! The mountain air, the pine trees, the clean roads, the old stone houses, the views.. Aah, it's as good as it can get! Lal Tibba itself is a point on the road where people climb a view point to check out the views. I didn't climb the view point to see the view but it is likely to be similar to the beautiful view one gets while walking to the place. Doing the walk to Lal Tibba is a must in Landour. It'll make you fall in love with nature all over again!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mussoorie: Cafe Ivy|4| “Lovely place but creates a lot of litter on the mountainside”|review_488781274|Cafe Ivy is very well located - the views of the mountains from its balcony are to die for! The food is good too, we had the veg and non veg pizza and pasta arabbiata and they were good. The ambience of Cafe Ivy is lovely too, giving one a feel of a quaint cozy restaurant. However, I just feel like the guests at this cafe litter the mountains below and need to be stopped from throwing tissues and plastic below. Beautiful nature should not be destroyed due to a cafe. I may not visit this place again because I hate seeing litter below the balcony here.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mussoorie: Landour Bakehouse|5| “Fabulous and a must visit in Landour”|review_488779858|Landour bakehouse has a beautiful atmosphere-I can sit here by the windowsill watching the pine trees all day! Wooden flooring and lovely souvenirs add to its old world charm. The staff are friendly and the food is reasonably priced for the quality provided. I had the hot chocolate with cinnamon and it was to die for! Do visit and it's impossible to not fall in love with it. I am definitely visiting this place when I'm back in Landour :)
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Singapore: Gardens by the Bay|5| “Beautiful flower exhibits coupled with information on reducing climate change”|review_480425699|Gardens by the Bay is a must visit in Singapore. It has beautiful flower exhibits and lovely grounds to walk around. The artificial tree like structures look beautiful at dusk with their lighting. If you visit Gardens by the Bay, do visit the Cloud Forest - it will be the highlight of your visit here, though you do have to pay extra to see it. Food maybe a problem for vegetarians here, so you may have to settle for Mc Donalds, but the sacrifice is worth it :)
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Singapore: National Museum of Singapore|5| “Great insight into Singapores history ”|review_480424216|This museum offers a detailed and informative insight into how Singapore became the glorious city it is today! It tells you the number of invasions the city has dealt with, how the government dealt with public infrastructure problems, the housing system, the varieties of ethnicities that have made Singapore their home and many other things I do not remember. I was amazed at how detailed the exhibits were and how interesting it was to learn about Singapores evolution. I highly recommend a visit to this place!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa)|5| “Very convenient, on time, with beautiful views! ”|review_480422478|The Sentosa cable car is a wonderful way to travel to the Sentosa island especially during day time because it has beautiful views of the harbour. The car runs on time and is the quickest way to travel to the island. Staff are helpful and organised. I thoroughly recommend using this during the day - if you want to use the cheaper railway option, use it at night on your way back from the island. Just make sure you check timings so you don't miss your last drop!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Adventure Cove Waterpark|5| “Very very nice! ”|review_480297499|This water park is a lot of fun.. I spent almost half a day here and could spend more. I absolutely love the water, and it was as so much fun to spend time on different types of water slides, which I repeated couple of times. The wave pool is good too, but crowded so I prefer the slides. I didn't do the snorkeling here-it felt too fake with fishes in a small confined pool and I didn't want to partake in it. Neither did I see the shark enclosure because I am scared to death of them. You can buy food here, including vegetarian for lunch and snacks. You will also get lockers when you enter (you have to pay a small fee for them) and the are very useful. This park is worth a visit for the many water slides and the wave pool. I will definitely visit again when in Singapore!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|5| “Super fun! ”|review_480295449|Universal studios is super duper fun, and a must visit in Singapore! You can take the free internal train in Sentosa to reach it. Go for the famous and in demand transformers ride and you will have the time of your life - you will definitely want to sit on it more than once! The other roller coasters in the "science" section made me queasy so i won't recommend them if you get sick on such rides, but Transformers is a must do. After this section, which is at the beginning of the park, take the time to visit each section and see what you would enjoy. Universal has a lot to offer, and reach early so you can spend the entire day here and do justice to this fun place. The pizza place here is really good, even for vegetarians, and you will get good ice-cream to beat the hot weather. If you travel with kids, they will enjoy the Puss in Boots and Madagascar shows that are in the evening,and the 3D movie. Take the time out to take pictures with all the cartoon characters that hang out with you in the evening, they are fun to look at later :). In a nutshell, Universal Studios is a must visit in Singapore - make sure you reach early and you spend the day here!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): Shabari|4| “Love this place! ”|review_479752357|Shabari is a small eatery for fast food near Santacruz station, Bombay. You cannot visit this place expecting fine dining or gourmet fare, and if you go expecting lovely, buttery pav bhaji, Indian style pizza, creamy sabjis, lovely Idli wada and nimbu pani, you will not be disappointed :). I love visiting Shabari occasionally for my fare of fast food like the ones I mentioned, or chaat or milkshakes. The prices are reasonable and you can choose to sit in either the air conditioned or non AC section. Will definitely be back!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): Indigo|5| “Great service, delicious food, lovely ambience ”|review_479520748|Indigo at Colaba has the best open air seating on the terrace and I highly recommend going there for dinner among the candle lit ambience. The service is on point, with waiters willing to customize your order and redo a dish that didn't live upto your expectations. The spaghetti is awesome, as is the mac n cheese. I don't remember the starters we had but they were really really good too. This place is on the more expensive side, but its absolutely worth it! I'm dying to go back!!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): Oven Fresh|4| “Great for desserts; other meals are average”|review_479167837|Oven Fresh has one of the best selection of desserts I have seen - their range is huge and everything looks amazing. I would definitely buy my cakes from here if I lived close by. However, the food is so-so: we had pizza and corn cheese balls, which were decent but the enchiladas disappointed hugely. I will visit here to eat desserts, but am not sure of the lunch or dinner. Eat here with much lower expectations of the food much lower than the desserts and you will not be disappointed.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): The Little Door|3| “Great ambience, good choice of food but very slow service”|review_479166287|The Little Door has a fun, young ambience with outdoor seating and a choice of games to keep you occupied. Food choices are European, with Italian and Mediterrenean occupying most of the menu. I visited for brunch, and had a decent selection of choices for breakfast, lunch and drinks from the preset menu for a fixed price, even among vegetarian dishes. I was happy with most of the breakfast served, with the stuffed mushrooms being good. The non alchoholic beverage - the watermelon cooler - was awful though. The service however, spoilt our experience - it was painstakingly slow! We ordered a souvilaki for breakfast which came an hour and a half after being ordered. Our lunch did not arrive an hour and a half of waiting, after which we cancelled our order, paid the bill and left. I checked with the waiter to see if the preset desserts had dried nuts (I am allergic) and he said they did not, but on tasting the dessert I realised that they did! So, if you visit here, be prepared to wait, A LOT, and spend your entire morning and afternoon here. If not, its not worth it (the preset menu is expensive and if you leave without eating lunch like we did, its an absolute waste of money. The restaurant offered us only 10% off even though they did not serve lunch an hour and a half after ordering). I will probably not visit this place again.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Hotel|Siddapura: Evolve Back, Coorg|5| “Superb is an understatement”|review_467486645|Orange County Coorg is beyond words-it is an experience of a lifetime. Everything here is done with such a level of care and attention to detail that you realise that only someone with a large heart and passion for hospitality can run this place. I stayed in the Lily pool cottage, with a beautiful outdoor private jacuzzi and one look at this place, and you would fall in love with the room. It's spacious, elegant and has everything you need on a holiday-a bathtub, cookies for munching, fruits, a coffee and tea maker. The trees surrounding this are full of birds chirping, and a paradise for bird lovers with the hornbills, barbets, bulbuls, all flying around you. Orange County food and restaurant staff is top notch, and they go out of their way to make you almost anything you want to eat. Their bakery items like quiches and breads are fresh and divine. High tea is served by the poolside. Every Saturday night has a theme based dinner-I experienced the paddy fields theme and I have to say, I have never had such a beautiful candle lit setting in the fields with such a vast spread of dishes ever! That dinner is one I will remember forever. Orange Countys property is spread over 300 acres, and the beautiful trees and plantations will make you want to give up city living. The activities including the plantation walk, nature walk, bird watching, village visit are very well organised and absolutely worth ones time. One can easily spend three days here without getting bored, with so many things to do or just spending your days in the two beautiful swimming pools here. Orange County is ideal for couples, but great with friends as well, and I highly, strongly, vehemently recommend visiting it!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Hyderabad: Blue Tree|4| “Variety of cuisines with good service”|review_460849979|Blue Tree serves a variety of cuisines, ranging from Indian to Italian to chinese, both vegetarian and non vegetarian. We had tomato soup, pizza, American chopsuey, mutton biryani, chicken starters and chicken pulao, along with wine and lime soda. All the food was good, and while it's not authentic Italian style pizza and soup, they were both good nonetheless. Portion sizes were big and worth the price charged. Service was good as well, with helpful waiters and good suggestions. While I found the ambience a bit of a let down with slightly dimmer lighting than I prefer, I enjoyed the meal and will definitely be back!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Hotel|Chandrapur: Tristar Hotels|4| “Under renovation, so be prepared for some inconvenience”|review_460269071|The Tristar Hotel is currently undergoing some renovation, where rooms are being painted and overhauled. Hence, the room I stayed in recently was smelling of paint, which after a point caused a lot of nose irritation. While the rooms are done well, with big beds and bathrooms, this strong smell was a problem. Once the hotel is completely ready, it will be a nice place to stay. The staff are helpful and the food is decent, though I will say that some items are a little spicy, so ask for less chilli if you cannot tolerate the heat. Overall, its a decent place to stay and well located on the main road in Chandrapur!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Attractions|Hyderabad: The Forum Sujana Mall|5| “Good variety of shops, nice food court”|review_458009671|The Forum mall in KPHB has a variety of shops for all types of customers-right from western casual and formal to Indian casual and bridal wear, for men, women and children. It houses a Central shopping center, which helps getting a number of things in a single location and has a number of brands like Neerus, Benetton, Arrow, Manyavar, Mebaz etc making it easy to get quality stuff in a single place. The food court has MC Donalds, pizza hut, kailash parbat and a couple of other shops and is a good place for a nice dinner. There is an amusement arcade for kids,along with a bowling alley for adults, and a movie theater, making it a complete entertainment center. I will definitely visit this place again when in Hyderabad.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Hyderabad: Vac's Pastries|4| “Snacks as good as its peers,but more expensive”|review_458008341|Vac's pastries serves similar snacks as it's peers like Big Byte,but has slightly higher prices for similar quality. For example, the dizzy dog sandwich in Vac's is for 60 rupees, while the same thing in Big Byte is 45 rupees. Only thing that is probably better in Vacs is variety of desserts. I have heard that quality of desserts is better here than other places, but since I haven't tried, I wouldn't be able to comment on that. All in all, for snacks I would probably go to another place but for desserts, I would try out Vac's.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Hyderabad: Little Italy|5| “Beautiful!”|review_458006514|Little Italy has a cozy decor, with it's well planned seating giving you a feeling of privacy despite having other people in the restaurant. The long glass windows give you a feeling of openness and the fire burning in the wood oven makes the ambience feel beautiful. The staff are top notch, with friendly smiles, showing genuine assistance for your meal. And the most important part, the food itself is delicious - it's fresh, well balanced and well presented. The choices are many, within the boundaries of Italian and Mexican, and vegetarian food. We had a Manali pizza, pesto pasta and both were fabulous. I highly recommend this place for a nice dinner, and will definitely be back!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Hotel|Singapore: Oasia Hotel Novena, Singapore by Far East Hospitality|3| “Would not recommend for a long stay”|review_447744140|Oasia has a number of positives - it is located right next to the Novena metro station and connected to it through an underpass, making transport all over the city very convenient. It has a lovely lap pool and jacuzzi to relax you holiday away. Rooms are clean and reasonably spacious, and some staff are friendly and helpful. The most helpful feature of this hotel is that it provides guests with a 4G enabled phone which one can use all over Singapore, and it generally has great offers and discounts for the most popular attractions like Gardens by the Bay, Universal Studio, Jurong Bird Park, among others.But,some of the staff can be impolite and leave a bad taste. Breakfast is till 10:30, but the staff there seem to be in a rush to finish everything off by 10 itself. You feel like they are in your face if you are eating at 10:15 and ask you to finish by 10:30. This feels awful if you are on a holiday and may want to have a late day one day. Breakfast options are extremely limited with almost the same menu daily, so bear that in mind if you staying here for over 3 days. Also, the service seems impersonal since there is no one who one finds approachable enough for suggestions on which places to visit, how much time it takes to get from one place to another or anything a tourist may want information for. With the hurrying and sometimes rudeness surrounding the breakfast and the lack of personalized service, I will not stay here again when in Singapore.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Goregaon: Goregaon Social|4| “Fabulous food, but be careful!!”|review_447741438|I visited Goregaon Social with a bunch of colleagues and really liked the food and the ambience. The serving style is beautiful, with Indian served in copper vessels and Chinese in take out boxes - the serving style matches the food ordered. We had Chinese takeout noodles and rocky road ice cream, and it was delicious. However, do take care as the restaurant served one vegetarian colleague a chicken biryani!! This really spoilt the mood of the party, and while the restaurant offered us our meal for free to compensate for hurting our sentiments, this was a dampener to a good lunch. Be careful to check if you have got what you ordered and you will enjoy yourself here.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): Bungalow 9|4| “Fabulous ambience, helpful staff!”|review_447739998|Bungalow 9 has one of the most beautiful ambiences I have seen in a restaurant in Mumbai. Its open air seating area reminds one of a lovely, light up, cozy lane in Europe! If you should go there for one thing, it is the ambience. It also helps that the staff is helpful, and the food satisfies. The Thai red curry is to die for, as is the baked cheesecake. Prices are similar to equivalent restaurants - about 1500 per couple. Book this place for a date night and you will not be disappointed!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): It Happened In New York|3| “Christmas debacle!”|review_447737783|It Happened in New York has a nice ambience, with an open rooftop restaurant, and is located in one of the most popular areas in Bombay, Bandra. What spoilt our experience here was that the waiters had no clue about the dishes and the food was just about average. There is nothing special or standing out in the menu which distinguishes this place from others. Prices are on par with restaurants in the area, and hence one enters this place with expectations that it matches upto others. With good training to the staff, it may be salvaged, but if not, I will not return.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Hotel|Panchgani: Treebo Residency|4| “You get what you pay for!”|review_439204872|Hotel Residency is a really good place to stay for the price once pays for it (we paid INR 2900 per night for the suite room, inclusive of lunch and breakfast). The rooms are clean and the food is (unexpectedly), really good. Staff are helpful and prompt. If you are not going to spend your entire day in the hotel, and if you do not expect a swimming pool and a spa and a lot of frills, this is a good place for a budget stay.The downside of Hotel Residency is that the views from the room are sad - you just see the road or the house next door. Additionally, one needs to inform the hotel in advance if one is having dinner and hence you need to plan your meals here. The rooms are a little small, especially if you have a child (even though we stayed in the suite we found it small). I am unsure if this place offers WiFi since I never asked for it.However, overall it is value for money and if I was looking for a budget place to stay with a bunch of friends, I would stay in Residency again.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Hotel|Mumbai (Bombay): GCC Hotel And Club|3| “Good staff, expensive food, average rooms”|review_435549337|My husband I stayed here for one night (which we got free through some points we had), and had an okay stay. We had mixed feelings after our stay, because of these points:The pros:1. Staff is friendly and helpful2. Located relatively close to Western Express Highway3. Breakfast and lunch buffet have good variety4. There is a good gym and pool hereThe cons:1. Food is expensive, so even though our stay was free, I feel we overpaid for food2. Quality of some dishes was not upto the mark which dampened our spirits3. There is construction going on in the hotel premises and near the pool, so it is a little uncomfortable to use the poolSo overall, we had an average stay - not bad but not great. Visitors can try out the new GCC hotel close to this club to see if that is better.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): Viaan|3| “Not Again!”|review_428664284|I ordered paneer chilly and a lotus root starter from Viaan and was so disappointed that I would never order from here again. The food was not fresh, and delivery took ages.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): China Gate|3| “Not worth the money”|review_428663796|China Gate has good staff, but the food fell short of my expectations. While the Tom Kha soup was really good, the rest of the food including the fried rice, the corn water chestnut starter and stir fry vegetables were not upto the mark. Maybe it was what we ordered - I am unsure but it didnt taste very fresh. The good part is that food was served quickly, but the taste and freshness disappointed. The ambience of China Gate is slightly dated, given the bevy of new Asian restaurants that have opened up in Bandra. Overall, would not visit again unless the eatery revamps its food.
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): Delhi Darbar|4| “Large portion size, reasonable prices”|review_421994600|Delhi Darbar has good food (I had the American Chopsuey here and my husband has chicken manchurian). Service is good too. However, the tables are a little crammed and you are sitting very close to the next table. Given that Delhi Darbar has reasonable prices compared to other places in Colaba, I guess one can deal with the table situation. I would visit again when in Colaba, and have the paan outside for sure!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): Pizza By The Bay|5| “Good food in a fabulous location!”|review_421990071|I love Pizza by the Bay, and recently has gnocchi in arrabiata sauce with cold coffee on a rainy day in Bombay. It was delicious, as was my husband's chicken pizza. I will admit that the food is heavy and oily, but it is delicious. Service is decent as well. But the best part about this eatery is its location - its right on Marine Drive, and opposite the sea. Sit here on a rainy day and you will love it!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): World Streat Food|5| “Definitely gonna be back!”|review_421979547|World Streat Food is this awesome concept where the cafe has some dishes from across the world including Japan, Thailand, India, Brazil, Austria, Indonesia, Vietnam, Mexico, among others. The beauty about visiting this place is you can have a starter from one region, the mains from another and the dessert from another. The ambience is peaceful, the service is nice and the prices are pocket friendly. Whats not to love! Do visit, and I will definitely visit again!
MM0311|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Restaurant|Mumbai (Bombay): Ristorante Prego|5| “Authentic Italian with impeccable service!”|review_421969658|I had mushroom risotto and the bruschetta platter in Prego, and I absolutely loved it! The food is lovely, and the restaurant gives you a nice small bread platter before your meal. Service is friendly, and when I mentioned that I was allergic to nuts, the chef himself came to assist me with what to chose. Since I visited late at night, there were only two other guests and so I loved the ambience here even more than one normally would given the peace and quiet. I will definitely visit again! If you love Italian food, you should visit too :)

We went for the same and waited for almost 2 hours from 9pm to 11:15 pm, however, it didn't happened. There was huge rush and lot of people were waiting for it, however, there was no announcement or communication to inform that it is not going to happen. I went to use the washrooms in the Marina Bay sands shopping complex, and found it to be stinking and had to return without using it !!! Terrible experience.

For a family of four, I spent about 20% less than the best quote from Travel agent, while covered 50% more attractions than offered by them. The attractions covered in Sentosa as per tour packages was not more than 5, while I directly bought one day pass online through Klook.com that gave access to all 20 attractions in Sentosa. We chose and covered 14 attractions in a day at Sentosa. Took the two way cable car from Harbourcourt station to reach Sentosa at 9am. We reached Siloso beach by 9:15am and were told at the ticket counter there that we need to redeem our online pass at Beach station. We took a free Sentosa bus from there to reach Beach station and redeemed our passes. Close tot that ticket counter, we saw ride counter for Segway and started with that. After that we went for sky ride and luge ride. On completing sky ride, we saw Tiger Sky Tower (instead of returning down by Luge immediately). Then, completed all nearby attractions - three 4D Adventure land rides, Madam Tussads and Merlion. Then, went to Sea acquarium and Trick eye museum, from there went to Mosh. Then, returned to Luge ride and where it ends is close to beach and Wings of Time. Completed both and took the Cable car back for harbour court MRT station around 8:30pm. We thoroughly enjoyed all attarctions.
Manish B|5DBEB03AFDCF114742727C3EB9A6E6B7|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|4| “Rain spoils Hollywood parade”|review_480127138|I visited USS on 14th Apr with my family, which was a public holiday in Singapore and therefore couple of extra events were scheduled i.e. Hollywood parade at 3;00 pm and Fireworks at 8:30pm. However, due to rains, the hollywood parade was cancelled. There was a huge rush in all the places - minimum 30 mts waiting for few rides we waited for over 90 minutes. The long queue for Transformer ride ran into multiple halls and two levels, which reminded us about the queue at Shirdi temple. There are no pure vegetarian eating joint inside USS and looks like a good business opportunity for Kailash Parbat, Anand Bhawan, etc Despite above issues, we had a great time and memorable trip. The most interesting rides were Jurassic park, Transformer, Madagascar, Speilberg show.

Ride up and park directly outside, expect a warm welcome and efficient service in a laid back venue. Good and beverages not mind blowing but don't really need to be. The brand new pool and pool bar give a great look out to Canggu beach just off Batu Bolong. Prefer this one to Finns.

All kids have a great time in this excellently laid-out indoor playground. The facilities are clean, safe and fun. Located above a Japanese restaurant, the kids can order from the menu and have a nice lunch there. A great change of pace to pool and restaurant time. Highly recommended.

Boss Man should be high on the list of considerations. Great burgers - quality meat. Eat in (quite busy at times - located near Sisterfields/Motel Mexicola) or delivery via Go-Jek app. Expect to pay around IRP8k for a burger.

The boats are great - impeccably clean and accommodating. All up the cruise took about 25 minutes and many of the main sights and attractions were pointed out along the way. The kids loved it.

It is a well run, fun thing to do, giving great views as we headed to the Singapore's island resort. One thing to keep in mind - you do not get off at Universal Studio's front doorstep, but the walk down from the cable car station to Universal's entry is a good easy one.

There are a few Jumbo's around Singapore - we suggest heading to the big one in Clarke Quay. As a minimum try the traditional chilli crab and maybe if you go as a couple or group make sure one of you has the very tasty salt & pepper crab too. It is a fun experience with the bibs and constant support of attentive waiters. Oh and the beers seem to taste even better there!!

Our family of four (5yr old Duke and 1 yr old Daisy) stayed at Double-Six to be near family during our recent four night stay and really enjoyed it. The many positives included the generous sized rooms and layout - we had the entry level Leisure Suite and it was great, the excellent pool (which included a shallow kids section), the happy and enthusiastic service, the breakfasts - a very diverse choice where buffet comes to you with an Indonesian influence, the in-room dining, the free wifi and parking and the rooftop bar. It is a really good experience. The only things that marked it down for us were a bit of a mouldy smell in the room, and the non-view from our large balcony.....it always makes us wonder why hotels that appear to be around 35% occupied still put people in the rooms with no view.

It was our last day before flying out and we thought we could do with a big meal in familiar surroundings. Bad attitude waiters, food no good, post-mix soft drinks...DON't BOTHER.

We pre-purchased our tickets (recommended) prior to getting to the park, so avoided the box office queue. We also purchased our VIP pass for the rides inside the park (definitely recommended) which gave us access to walk up starts to all rides, rather than queuing for 40 odd minutes. We loved our time there; some highlights: the Madagascar ride, the Sesame Street show and spaghetti ride, the awesome Transformers ride, the Mummy ride, the rollercoaster, the water fountain park in Jurassic Park. The choice of food was actually really good for a fun park, and you can get a beer if you want.We will be back.

Kangaroos, emus, wombats that lived their entertaining handlers, huge crocs, lions (magnificent), and many more. Make a visit and help sustain this wonderful hidden gem.

Possibly only by social media but this fish n chip shop claims to be top 3 in the state of NSW. The seafood - you see it and choose it when ordering - is great. We had stick standard fish and chips with snapper as the fish. Very tasty but possibly a little over cooked and on the dry side. Remember - CASH ONLY.

That venue is now named Sunday's Beach Club and Finns is now up at Canggu. As you approach, it appears to be a really attractive place - a real alternative to our fave Potato Head. Sadly it is not:* too many rules - if you are going there to check it out, you will only be permitted to have a look one person at a time;* mandatory minimum spend for everyone - IRP1,500,000 for day beds• majority of day beds have no shade all day - bad for families• stupidly overpriced (although this helps get to the min spend)• dirty - the pool and change rooms most relevant. Bathrooms looked neglected. Murky water in pool. Parents advising kids to not put their head underwater. Floating bandaids. We lost a bracelet over the side of the pool and the security guard lifted some rocks to find it and the slime in the area where pool water overflows was disgusting* random service - we took a photo of a ground of 9 staff all hanging around the bar not serving or doing anything really -27th December, lunchtime. Not cool. * transport - no cabs, the only way out is via a 'limo' with rates negotiated by Finns. It is a pity because if managed properly it could be a very attractive venue but is misses on almost everything. Don't bother - too many better alternatives.

We were surprised we were having a great catch up and fun and knew we were not being too loud.They then came back and told us we would have to move inside as they had neighbours and noise restrictions ( this was 9:30 ) we asked for the bill and did not want to give them anymore of our cash. we told them it was very rude to talk to us like this and we had not been too loud they were a bar/resturant and people were suppose to have fun. We were not yelling, we were not dancing on tables or acting in any wrong way.the table next to us said they could not belive what the waitress had said to us and that they agreed we were not bothering them or anyone else. The staff had such terrible attitude and teated us badly.I dine in all of the top restaurants all over the world and The Butter was disgraceful.

It must be one of the best value for money Italian restaurants around the tourist district in the north part of Seminyak. The gnocchi in particular is outstanding. Mains are around IDR5000 to 7000. ADine in, take away and Go-Jek all available.

The Butcher's Club in Petitgenet was a great find for the family. Great fit out, understanding staff and great food wonderfully hit the spot. We had the signature beef burger and the Miss Piggy pork burger with duck fat fries and onion rings. The kids ate the 1/4 chicken and fries. The decor is great and it is worth dining in but the whole menu is available in Go-Jek.

The resort is located 45 minutes west of Waikiki and fairly remote from the tourist part of Oahu. The resort is imposing - magnificent in its appearance, beautifully appointed rooms and facilities, a great amount of things to do (including world class, huge kids club) and of course, the Disney characters starring Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Chip n Dale, LIlo and Stitch who came out at regular scheduled times. We had two adjoining rooms that were very roomy and overlooking a golf course that wrapped around the resort. The staff were magnificent, as you would imagine. The resort technology was great - the room key doubled as a charge card and the kids club bracelet doubled as a GPS tracking device for kids. It is a magnificent resort and anyone that stays there will have a memorable time. Some hints:* Plan ahead. The website and confirmation emails suggest you to do so and you will benefit from pre-booking almost everything such as dining experiences* Get up early and get your day bed/pool seat early. If you haven't got yours by 9.30 you may not get one. * Bring your snorkel and mask - the snorkelling off the beach is pretty good. * Expect crowds. The resort is enormous but the crowds are well managed. ^ The food...little really healthy options or variety, although the food is good. Many people go outside the resort to the local shopping center for alternatives.....something to consider. We loved Aulani.

The decor is really cool, service excellent, cocktails perfect and food superb. This is now one of our favourite eateries in Bali. We had the pork ravioli special and the porcetta for main with a selection of starters to get us going. It is one of those places where you could choose anything on the menu and be fully satisfied. We were pleasantly surprised by the bill. Heaps of space and great for kids.

We saw the 5 star reviews so opted to give this relatively new kid on the block a go. We had a fun time at Ling-Lings. The drinks were good, in particular the pineapple daiquiris, and well priced. The food was tasty and good sized portions - just not quite 5 star freshness and quality. If you are looking for a mid range dinner it was fine. One to tick off the list.

Breakfast was great - we had the the KDT big breakfast, the corn and zucchini fritters, the grilled asparagus and the breakfast burrito. Coffees and juices - especially the Superfly - were great.

During our stay we experienced a couple of things that prevented us from rating this nice hotel a little higher. The first involved the rooftop bar - it was closed for a corporate event. We understand that hotels need to make money but if the main attraction is closed, notify the guest - ideally prior to their stay, and keep a small section open for in house guests . We would at least expect a letter under the door informing us, We found out as we were attempting to head up the elevator. The hotel doesn't have a pool so the only attraction is the roof top bar we were disappointed it was closed. Our only dining experience was breakfast served in room. Whilst generous servings, they completely forgot the poached eggs and generally got things wrong. The staff did all they could to rectify things but don't get them wrong to begin with. The other was the noise. Constant sirens from the police taking off from the station across the road. This was despite the double glazing on the windows, so unfortunately this is something that does not go away. Overall a good hotel in a pretty good location. No concierge to assist with a luggage not an obvious front door/drop off spot for taxis. For us it was not worth the $160 a night premium to the other hotels that we have reviewed. We didn't try the hotel restaurants so can't comment on them.

The hotel itself is nice - large and set in the beautiful Blue Mountains (Leura). It is surrounded by a seemingly basic golf course (we didn't play so can't really make comment). Service was EXCELLENT, from check-in, dinner, room service and departure. The hotel itself had some issues that the staff had to deal with on the day: their computer system was down so they did't have our booking; they couldn't cut our room keys - but the front office staff were brilliant in dealing with a potential difficulty. The facilities were great - a fantastic indoor kids play area, which Duke and Daisy both loved. Dinner and wines were great - although they had run our of 3 of the six main meals on the menu, and the particular wine that we had ordered. But again the staff did their best and the food was great. Buffet breakfast was also really good for an Australian hotel/restaurant, with the first class view in the background.We will be back.A word of noting - it is a resort that gets completely booked out by corporates, so make sure you book well ahead to avoid times where the hotel staff may be focused on preparing for incoming large corporates - it may impact the food and facilities available to you if you are booked to stay just before or just after a sell out.

The whole experience was very well organised: from the personal greeting by our host (and tour guide); the excellent glamp-style tents (easily accommodating our family of four); the unique up-and-personal tours with the elephants, giraffes, lions and rhinos....all excellently done. After a day enjoying the animals experiences we were treated to an amazing evening, starting with wine tasting of local wines and cheese followed by the most delicious meal. We tried new flavours of buffalo stew and crocodile, everything was well organised and the service provided to us and our children was first class. We then had a very comfortable night in our glamping tent ready for the 2nd day. The morning tour started at 7am - this was a little early for our children so we did miss it however other guest told us it was great. We arrived at breakfast early and they were kind enough to let us start feeding our hungry kids. The tour came back and we all enjoyed a very generous and delicious buffet breakfast.We checked out at 10am and went into the public part of the zoo to do our own exploring. We had bikes included in our zoofari package however we decided to treat our kids with the golf kart (if you want the kart make sure you get to the zoo when it opens so you don't miss out). We put our 1 years old's car seat in and our 4 year old was big enough to go in the seat belt. They both loved the open air kart and seeing all of the other animals. We highly recommend this zoo and the lodge and will do it again when the kids are older. I do feel it is more suited to older children as it does have quite a strict schedual for the Zoofari experience and which made it a little challenging with our 1 year old Daisy.

We dropped in on Saturday night to experience dinner. We were fortunate to get a seat at the counter by the pizza bar - it is one of the hot spots in Surry Hills so we wouldn't have been surprised to have not been seated at all. We perused quite limited and underwhelming menu - and ordered main only. Whilst the papadelle pasta and the steak were fine, the lack of imagination around the presentation and accompanying foods (a cabbage leaf!) was bad. We didn't bother with desert. Not sure why we tipped as service sucked. The decor looked like it was only half finished. Plenty of alternatives around so won't be going back.

The hair dresser from Melbourne was great and gave a fab blow dry and braid. We will be back but we will also be looking for other spas too

It seems to aim to attract the upper end restaurant diners. Such is the quality of restaurants in Seminyak/Kerobokan/Batu Belig it is hard to rate Saigon Street as anything other than just ok. Cocktails are overpriced and in our case the cocktail that we ordered was not delivered. Food was good, particularly the ribs - but similarly overpriced. We think we have to give it another go as we really want it to be a success.

The pool and grounds are a huge size and there is plenty of room for the kids to run and play. The pool also had a shallow ledge and our non swimming 4yr old had a great time splashing around in the shallow water.We travelled with another family so all together we had 4 adults 2 4yr olds and a 6mo old and found the villa had plenty of room for everyone The bedrooms were simple in furnishings but extremely comfortable and large. It had a huge walk in wardrobe something we love as we transformed the robe into our baby's bedroom .. It was quite and dark and she slept like a dream.The staff from the housekeeping to front desk were so helpful and great with the kids, the free buggies into Seminyak was a fab service and almost always available. The free in villa breakfast was a yummy and easy option and they work around your day and what time you like.The manager (sorry I forgot his name ) was so accomodations and he even offered us a free breakfast at la luciolla for being great guest.We love Kunja's location it's close enough for all the action yet far away enough to be peaceful.We generally choose villas with an inclosed TV room for the kids so they can have a break from the heat and mozzies however we just turned the kids room into the play/TV room in the day so it worked out well.Kunja has great mozzie prevention and we hardly saw any.The only suggestion I have for Kunja would be block out curtains rather than Venetian blinds but it is so hard to fault Kunja as it was a great stay and we didn't want to leave.Thank you Kunja and we look forward to seeing you again very soon

Eggs, bacon, orange juice, coffee and toast. We visited Bills Sydney in Waikiki to meet friends (from Sydney) for breakfast. We discovered a restaurant that hits all the high notes - a great fit out, enthusiastic service, an interesting menu, excellent coffee, healthy and delicious food in a clean, bright and spacious area. Make sure you have the corn fritters and the pancakes. Kids note: staff are great with kids. Try to go for a bench seat, although they do have great high chairs.

You get the obvious - restaurants at the Crown, St Kilda establishments - blah. You ask smart people in Melbourne about the best luncheon restaurant in the CBD and you will quickly learn about this place. Forget the menu - the extensive list of daily specials recited by the amazing wait staff will have you wanting everything. The food is magnificently presented and tastes are world class. The wine and beer lists are great. Catarina has a lot to be proud of. This is the go to place in Melbourne and will be for years to come.
WheresDuke|FA421A7469B07CB0050D55AEC8165096|Hotel|Honolulu: Trump International Hotel Waikiki|5| “TRUMP: The Outstanding Waikiki Hotel”|review_341117998|First time guests of Trump hotels worldwide would be blown away, returning guests will be attracted by the luxury, excellent service and superb attention to detail within THE outstanding Waikiki hotel. We stayed in a 2 bedroom/3 bathroom/full kitchen/two balcony plus den suite during late December and will definitely be returning every time we stay in Oahu. Our family party of 7 arrived early in the morning and very conscious that our 4 year old Duke and 6 month old Daisy would need a day sleep following the overnight flight from Sydney. We had spoken with the hotel in the week leading up to our stay and had requested an early check in (normally 3pm) or at least use of their arrival suite. We had also received an email from the hotel prior to our arrival enquiring about the ages of Duke and Daisy. We were so impressed by what we discovered – reception apologised that we would have to wait 15 minutes (we expected hours) for the room to be made available. When we were shown to our MAGNIFICENT suite at 10.30am (at no extra charge) was wonderful. The kids had personalised amenities – Duke had his own perfectly fitting Trump bathrobe and slippers. Daisy had her own very high quality crib (rather than a fold out porta-cot) that we were able to wheel into the oversized walk-in robe and use for her bedroom during our stay. The bedrooms huge. The beds high-end quality. The bathrooms better than most hotels around the world (two bathrooms ensuite with tubs). The living area huge (two pull out beds). The kitchen would be an upgrade in most homes around the world. EVERYTHING surpassed expectations. Around the hotel, the detail and facilities were high quality. The infinity pool, the restaurants (great breakfast), room service as well as the location were all great.  Whilst the service was impeccable from everyone at the hotel, we wanted to single out Dean on the concierge desk. He was fantastic every day, from organising cars, planning our trip to the north of Oahu, providing hints on restaurants along the way, giving valuable advice on our day trip to Hanauma Bay or organising our luggage to be walked across to our next hotel – all with a smile and enthusiasm. Thanks Dean. Duke’s view: the shallow part of the pool was my favourite and I liked the lady coming up to give me a towel every time I was finished; I liked sleeping in the den and I had 4 TVs to watch, even though I didn’t because the beach was so close that we spent lots of our time there; Mummy was very happy because her favourite breakfast place (Bill’s) was just around the corner and her favourite shops only two blocks away.
WheresDuke|FA421A7469B07CB0050D55AEC8165096|Hotel|Honolulu: Embassy Suites by Hilton Waikiki Beach Walk|3| “Good but lacks luxury”|review_337812590|On paper, the Embassy Suites has so much going for it, and so many travellers are very happy with what Embassy provides: excellent location, free daily buffet and cooked breakfasts, a great pool, free cocktails at sunset at the poolside bar, good sized suites. Our family of 7 stayed at the Embassy suites for 6 nights in a 2 bedroom plus living room (pull out sofa bed) suite immediately after staying 3 nights at the Trump (right across the road) in a 2BR plus den/3 bath suite at almost the same nightly price (we got a suite deal) so we can’t help but compare. Aside from the excellent location, everything at the Embassy was simply good. We frequently commented that the hotel and what it offers seems to be on par with a P&O ship (as opposed to a Celebrity/Royal Caribbean). although breakfast is free you know the saying you get what you pay for....The breakfast dining area is busy, not particularly tidy and perpetually occupied with hard working staff pushing trolleys of either mass produced foods (in) or trash (out), which partly explained why the floors had that slippery feel to them. The queues to the omelette/egg stations were invariably long but eggs well prepared (John was fabulous). The rooms were older but good – a tight fit for 7 but great for a family of 5: the bathrooms were compact and a little old but clean, they had the old school shower in the bath; the bedrooms were comfortable; amenities very basic; kitchenette tiny but useful; room service questionable (when would the cleaner not remove pizza boxes, empty the trash etc??). The pool area was very good – in particular the kids shallow section that was perfect for under 5s and the bar snack menu gave us an alternative for lunch (even if it did mean being snapped at by the grumpy barman).  We must single out two people that constantly provided excellent service: Carlton on the concierge desk provided fantastic job in arranging hire cars, recommending day trips, restaurants and chatting with a great sense of humour and upbeat attitude. Aldrid was fantastic to us and many others in providing service and arranging tables for our large group each morning that we had breakfast at the Embassy. Thank you to both. Overall, we were happy with our stay but we won’t be back. We look for the finer things on our holidays and the Embassy didn’t have the polish or added luxury we expect on holidays. We have marked the hotel down noting that comparing it with the 5 star Trump is almost unfair, but this hotel was the same price. It is a very good hotel for families, but just not for us. Duke’s view: breakfast was good for scrambled eggs and toast, but no chance of getting an apple juice; the pool was great – particularly the shallow part for me; the pull out sofa bed was good but I was always the last one asleep; the location was great – easy for Mummy to get to the best shops in Waikiki and for all of us to get to the beach.
WheresDuke|FA421A7469B07CB0050D55AEC8165096|Restaurant|Honolulu: PF Chang's|3| “Disappointing Chinese restaurant”|review_335590346|Located at the Trump/Embassy Suites end and on both the ground and first floor of the Royal Hawaiian Center, PF Chang's is a large restaurant that benefits from the fact that (i) there are not a lot of Chinese restaurants in the area, and (ii) it is a very busy location. Our party of 7 was quickly seated upstairs and given menus. When the waiter eventually showed up and offered assistance, it seemed each question about the menu was answered in a "I'm not sure". Food was very basic - mongolian beef the best dish, the sweet and sour pork the worst. We got our fix of Chinese but won't go back. Note for parents: apart from offering high chairs, there were very limited options for kids.

Whilst we love the resort, we feel that the dining options are too much like those of the theme parks - mostly over-priced, limited variety and generally not very healthy. We followed the lead of others and brought in two large pizzas (a margarita and a Hawaiian Special) They were definitely enjoyed by all. A great alternative to the over-priced buffet.

Located a block and a half from the Trump/Embassy, Hard Rock is a family restaurant that doesn't need to be visited more than once. The burgers are o. Or with any other restaurant in Waikiki, the ribs good, the fish tacos horrible. The extended happy hour a good thing but did not offset the slightly pricey overall bill.

The onion rings, the ribs, the buffalo wings, the Cobb salads and the ranch chicken salads (huge) all fantastic in a fun and chilled out environment......and we haven't even got the extensive and magnificent assortment of cheesecakes. Add beer and family of seven superbly and enthusiastically waited on and you have a fun, excellent formula.

Makahiki completely fails to deliver. I suspect that only guests of Aulani dine here. It was our first night and we were under prepared so tried out this buffet only option. We had a group of six plus one (similar to a recent reviewer, our four year old was overwhelmed by the day in the pools and lagoon so was asleep ten minutes in. Our waitress was lovely but we were shocked to find a $45 tip (AUD62) for serving drinks!!! The carvery was ok. The selection basic BD poorly presented - again a shock within this resort where so much attention to detail impresses. The crab claws were the standout. The sashimi could have been so much better presented. The deserts were great.We were really disappointed - would have preferred pizza in the room watching the Lion King.

One block from the Trump so usefully convenient for us. Having dined there, we know that is is no icon. Roy's is a large restaurant and you very much get the feeling that the people there are going through the motions in attending to you. The crusted mahimahi was the worst seafood dish that we have had. The half chicken good. The duck was drowned in sauce - almost inedible. The ribs were great. Duke had the pasta from the kids menu - a huge bowl of flat noodle spaghetti with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese that he was never going to eat. He even knocked back the ice cream (unimpressed). The chocolate soufflé was really really good. A real missed bag. May have got a four rating if we had ordered better. Marked down on service.

Earlier that day (breakfast at Bill's) a friend had told us of the amazing food they had tasted at a Thai restaurant on level 3 of the RHC. This was the one we found. They quickly made room for our party of 7 and were superbly efficient. Amongst the highlights were the crab green curry and the perfect crispy garlic chicken. Duke was well looked after with a impressively presented ice cream. Great value for money - amongst the best in Waikiki.

The menu is predictable - burgers, quesadilla, mahimahi, nachos. The atmosphere, service and location are the outstanding features of Duke's. Of course the merchandise appealed to us. Overall: kids loved it, adults enjoyed the cocktails.

We had previously stayed in the Mulia Resort and not really understood the distinction, although found it to be first class.The Mulia is the premium part of the complex. We chose the Earl Suite as it has amazing and unobstructed views of the ocean (and protecting reef) from your room/huge balcony with spa bath, as well as the fact that it was just over 100 sqm. Heaps of room for us and 3 year old Duke to relax when we weren't out and making the most of the facilities.While you have full access to the hotel's extensive facilities and restaurants - including free and incredible kids club, pools and kinds splash pool, pool bars, beach - the Mulia is an exclusive part of the hotel. Guests of the Mulia will be introduced to their personal butler - you will be shown to your room, your private cabana and the 4pm high tea that can only be experienced to be believed. Our particular butler, Yuni, asked if we were ok with her collecting Duke from the kids club (Mulia Kidz) and bringing him via golf cart to our private poolside cabana while we ordered a Long Island Iced Tea.Can't help it - we have to return.

Grandma's in Alexandia is just one of those. We found this place for lunch when passing a crowded Grounds just up the road. It dining capacity is far larger than appears from outside. Menus come loaded onto an iPad - you would happily order more than half the choices on the menu. Drinks and service were great. Duke played in the kids area - toys, teepee, books - making the lunchtime experience all the more enjoyable.

We traditionally stay at private villas as a rule (shy away from corporate owned hotels), however the W Retreat & Spa in Seminyak has us now questioning our choices in the future - it is so good. The W has so many things that it gets right; is so accommodating for singles and families alike; is so cool and is perfectly located. We booked into a Wonderful Garden View Room (two Queen beds for two adults and our 3 year Duke) and found that we had a spacious ocean facing room with a stunning view. The rooms are incredibly efficient in their layout, with a wet room including bath and shower a feature. The amenities, fittings and bedding all outstanding. You could write a book about how remarkable this place is and the hotel website provides a great entree to those considering it. Things that we love about this place (and can't wait to experience again):* the Spa - it is rare that a hotel spa is both reasonably priced, beautiful and provides great treatments - the W Spa gets all three right;* the Service - so many cool hotels around the world (Mondrian, Standard, Gansvoort etc) miss so badly on service; the service from everyone at the W is as good as it gets - it makes sense that they refer to staff as "Talent";* the Pools (and the floating beanbags);* the View and sunsets (it is possible that nobody that stays or visits at sunset leave without a photo with the W);* the Breakfasts and the Brunch - no point trying to describe how good they are - just make sure you experience them for yourself (Sunday brunch is a must - book ahead);* WOO Bar cocktails (LIIT please);* high tea (another must).This place is definitely kid friendly. Duke was made to feel like royalty.

This is the coolest place in Seminyak/Kerobokan during the day. Whilst it is very much a pool bar - cool music, cool (and very good) service, great cocktail, wonderful day beds - it is very family friendly. We bring Duke early enough to get one of the best situated day beds (it opens at 11). He is one of many welcomed kids at Potato Head jumping in and out of the infinity pool, running around on the large grassed area or lounging around with iPad at the ready while snacking on the (reasonable) bar food. We brig our nanny and she is made welcome as any in the family.

The hotel is very clean and peaceful, you can relax well specially on the lobby. We stayed to this hotel because it is near to the Safari World but if you want to go to the City of Bangkok, better not to stay here because it is far, traveling time will be less than an hour.

Better to go in the morning at 8-9 am to see and watch all the programs because every hour, you can watch some shows like elephant shows, spywar, dolphin and many more. We couldn't watch the other shows coz we came late at around 12 pm. We missed the other shows but still we enjoyed and took some pictures with the animals.

Our room is too small for us specially if you have big luggages. The price is quite expensive for 4 days and there are no bellboys also to carry the luggages/bags, i had carried our bags to 4th floor using their big troleys. The swimmingpool is so nice, my 2 kids enjoyed a lot.

It is very near to KL tower but we didn't go there coz of the weather, sometimes it rains but still the temperature is very hot. The room is very big but I don't like the smell when we entered the room. The location for breakfast isn't inside the hotel as well, you need to walk for a minute to reach the J&P Magic house restaurant (property of ABest)

A nice view on the beach and swimmingpool. We stayed for 1 day only. Better to stay near to the pool area. You can go to the beach as well and hire a surf board, it is a great stay for my family. The price is too high but it's worth it.

It's a nice hotel, a friendly staffs. Only 3 minutes walk to Festival Mall. It is near also to Star Mall. All hotel staffs are friendly. A 25 minutes drive from hotel to airport terminal 3.

A great room for family or couples. You can go to the mall easily in just 3 minutes walk. But one thing I don't like is the hotel parking, everytime you have to go out, we always go to the lobby and take a hotel parking pass.

Foods are ok, but the room which is the smallest one is not good which does not have a phone signal, i like the service specially when u book/reserved the transportation from hotel to the airport. A little bit noisy coz the hotel is located at the main road but its fine with me. ^_^

There's no problem with the transport, there's a pick up shuttle bus every 10 minutes going to tsuen wan mtr station. The service is very awesome especially on the front desk, they're very friendly and cooperative. We missed to use the pool, because of the climate. uhuhuh. it was around 9 degrees celcius that time. Hope we can come back to this hotel with my family again!

The best rides for excitement were Transformers (new), Cylon and Mummy. Other rides really for younger kids/families. Went before 10.00 (gates opened at 9.50 and took 20 mins to get in). Recommend staying in a close hotel, so when queues really long had a relax at our hotel 3-5.00pm. Went back and the lines so much shorter, stayed doing roller coasters until 7.00pm close. Had lots of fun but for the teenager go somewhere else with a lot more thrills.

There would be more atmosphere on quieter nights. I would recommend it to others and would do other ghost tours when I venture back to Melbourne.

Chris H|D57B8986F4AB93910A1795980CCB3F0A|Attractions|Shoal Bay: Tomaree Head|5| “Without a doubt the best views in town!”|review_504297739|If you have moderate fitness levels, this is a must do activity weather you're a local or a visitor to the area. You'll arrive at the far end of shoal Bay Beach to be greeted by a path beginning the ascent to the top. Take your time as you climb to the top so everyone can take in the views from the different angles overlooking beautiful port Stephens. A couple of hundred metres up the track, and it splits off with one direction heading towards some old army gun bunkers,and the other way heading to the summit. Both are well worth checking out if you have the time and energy! Keep heading towards the top and you'll reach the stairs. You're nearly there. Persevere... At the top take advantage of the near 360degree views. Try to spot some whales. Take a selfie on one of the viewing platforms... Maybe propose to your partner... Either way enjoy this special place. If you're really motivated you can leave just before sun rise or sun set and really get the most from this spot. Just remember to pack water. There is nowhere to fill up your bottles once you're on your way... And don't forget your camera!

The decor was clever. Made up to look like an old train strain, and was well laid out. There are enough sections that even though it's a large space, you don't feel crowded by other diners.
Chris H|D57B8986F4AB93910A1795980CCB3F0A|Hotel|Yagoona: Hume Hotel|4| “On the upper end of budget accommodation.”|review_499520161|With comfortable, clean, well equipped and recently renovated rooms, the Hume is a great choice if you're looking for budget accommodation around the greater Bankstown area. Check in is at the bar, and the staff are friendly and helpful. The room I had was spacious, with its own cavernous bathroom... I mean for any hotel room the bathroom was huge. Note that there's no restaurant at the pub, but they do make pizzas... There are also not many choices for dining options within waking distance, so you'll need to plan out your stay. The only thing that let down my stay is something you can't control... Other guests. No matter where you stay, if you get noisy neighbours, it makes for a rough stay. I would definitely stay here again.

This is my "Local"... I call in here for a beer with workmates on a Friday afternoon, I take the family here some weekends and I take guests here for a quality lunch out!It goes without saying that the beer offerings here are world class, but on top of this, you'll find great meals at reasonable prices.Bring the family along as well. The restaurant/bar is located on lush green grounds among a small vineyard. There's plenty of safe space for the kids to run around, and some organised kids activities.So, organise a designated driver, and get yourself along here if you're a local or a visitor to the area!

We had a compact size hire car, and it was still a squeeze to fit into the space.I'd still stay here again.

Fast and friendly staff”|review_489715709|My usual travel plan is to stalk out the nearest coffee shop to the hotel I'm staying at. A quick google search, and this came up closest.I had high hopes of this place delivering quality coffee, and when it came down to it, the coffee didn't disappoint.They made my usual coffee quite well, were speedy and served with a smile.

The meals were good, the staff were extremely friendly, and the beer was cold, however for a bunch of workmates meeting up for dinner and a beer, we felt we didn't quite fit in...This place looks like it'd be good for couples, group get-togethers, or families.... none of these were us.If you like a clean pub, and fancy meals, I reckon this place could be for you.

Ibis Sydney airport is everything you need for an overnight stay before an early morning flight. Comfortable bed, hot shower and a clean room. Beware that if you're going to park a car here, it will cost you $25 per night for the "privilege". Alternatively if you can organise getting here another way, there is a shuttle service provided. Meals downstairs are great value and generous portions.

Chris H|D57B8986F4AB93910A1795980CCB3F0A|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|3| “Fun Family Day, but expect things to be expensive!”|review_479613546|There's no need to explain what Universal Studios is... you probably already know!There are heaps of great rides, fantastic shows and other entertainment. My family absolutely loved going there! It is a quality park.We attended mid week in the middle of April, so thought it'd be a bit quiet... Ques were fairly reasonable, however for some rides we waited upwards of an hour even when the advisory signs suggested 30mins... i'd hate to imagine wait times in peak season!If your children are over 1.2m tall, they'll be able to go on every ride in the park! This thrilled my 7 year old son!Tip for buying your tickets... Head into China Town to the Peoples Palace Shopping mall (Big Old Green Building) head upstairs to the travel agencies and buy your tickets through them. It'll cost a lot less than buying at the gate. Just check for online deals first to give some slight negotiating power!Just beware, when you're in the park expect to pay close to four times the price for food and drinks as you would elsewhere in Singapore, It is after all on Sentosa!

Enjoy watching the dancers as you check in, then relax at one of the many bars or restaurants for a cold beer.This was a family getaway for us, so the appeal of the mini zoo, and the kids club were highly important, and did not disappoint.The kids loved watching feeding time for the Crocs, and highly enjoyed attending the Kids club activities.The huge pool is great, and not so crowded mid-week.Massive selection of restaurants, and great buffet breakfast mean there's probably something for everyone here.Just beware alcohol is quite pricey working out to about $7-8AU per can of beer... however when we were there, the resort was running a special, and during happy hour at the poolside we could get a pint of Erdingger for about $12AU.Highly recommended if you're travelling to Singapore and want to get away for a couple of nights.

This is a far better experience than economy on Scoot, with meals and entertainment provided, as well as larger, more comfortable, reclining seats.It made for far better rest on the overnight flight.Just a note though, business class on Scoot compares to premium economy on most other airlines (although with more leg room)
Chris H|D57B8986F4AB93910A1795980CCB3F0A|Attractions|Scoot (inc tigerair Singapore)|4| “Better than you would expect for a budget Airline”|review_479335375|There's no disguising the fact that Scoot is a budget airline! Your economy ticket gets you a seat on the plane and that's it!For meals, drinks, snacks and entertainment, you'll have to pay extra (Cheaper booking this ahead of time rather than on-board)... but in saying this, even after paying for every extra on-board luxury, you're still ahead of the competition for cost.The seats compare with every other airline I've traveled with for comfort, and the service is every bit as good as travelling on some more expensive flights.As long as you go into this knowing you're travelling a budget carrier, you'll be pleased...Only downside is my flights have been delayed a few times travelling singapore to sydney.

As a former local, I never had the chance experience any accommodation in town, so had no idea where to stay on a recent family trip there.We made the right choice with the family room at the Glen Haven. It easily and comfortably accommodated us. Having two separate rooms (one for us, and one for the kids!) was fantastic.I would definitely stay here again.

I didn't expect too much for $100 a night, but was pleasantly surprised by a clean, modern, well equipped family room when we arrived. There's great facilities on site as well to help tame the wild (bored) kids after a long day in the car!Overall I am extremely impressed!

Note though, if you wish to park off the street, there is a surcharge, otherwise (providing you can finds a spot) there is timed parking on the street right out the front. I was leaving early the following day, so decided to risk it with the timed parking.Once passed the 24 hour reception, you'll find yourself wandering through a dimly lit lane-way, and up a corridor to your 1980's inspired hotel room.I can't complain though. The room was clean, comfortable, and everything worked as expected. I got a good nights sleep!

But not the worst BY A LONG WAY.The room has everything you need for staying on a business trip. Free Wi-Fi is good, and not too slow. Location was handy for me (Close to Bankstown airport), but the trade off was being on a main road.The rooms probably would have been classed as luxury in the late '90s, but aren't so bad.The biggest complaint I have is the lack of secure parking... Make sure you line up somewhere secure to park if you're carting precious cargo!

Easy trips from here up and down the coast... Great if you want to take the "Scenic route" south down the coast, or drive along picturesque mountain roads with great views back along the coast.Facilities are everything you'd expect in a Family Cabin, and everything was neat and clean. There's even your own private BBQ on the deck right outside your front door.The kids playground is a great bonus if you're travelling with little ones!

AND HEATING!We stayed for a two night gettaway with the family to visit Dubbo zoo. While it's a bit of a drive from the cabin, (15 mins) it's close to shops / takeaway / churches etc.Only downside for us was next door is an indoor sports arena that shares a carpark with the cabins. When there's comp's on in there, it's packed and very hard to find a park!

Being close to the worksite I was visiting made it ideal. The staff were exceptional. Nothing was too much hassle for them to organise, and they were always professional. While I didn't get to make use of most of the facilities, I did make use of the sports bar on level 2. If you're looking for a relaxed 'pub-style' place to eat and grab a cold beer then this is for you. (just beware beer is not as cheap as it is in Australia!)Make sure you order a fruit platter to your room, and get in early for the grab-and-go breakfast, it goes quickly!

The pub wasn't particular busy due to it being quite late for lunch (3pm) It took them a little while to take our order, but when it arrived it was wrong. The waitress didn't seem to speak very good English as we must have told her 3 times that the order was wrong. She was just looking at us as if she didn't know what to do. We actually had to tell her to take it away and rectify it. They had put goats cheese on my burger, which is specifically told them I didn't want. When they 'rectified it' they had simply scraped it off. Good job I wasn't allergic to it and it was just a preference. Again, no apology offered when they brought the food back. The food was actually pretty good. It then took them a good 20 minutes to clear our plates & bring the bill. We sat waiting for another 5 minutes after that for the waitress to bring the card machine. We gave up in the end and walked to the till to pay. There needs to be some serious training offered to the staff here. Such a shame because the food was delicious.

The room was very nice. The bed was larger and comfortable and the shower was good. There are a few teething problems with it being a new hotel. The breakfast food wasReplenished quickly enough, so on one of the days we had to wait 20 minutes for it to be filled up again. The corridors look a bit like a prison because there are no pictures/colour. The pool area is a bit small for the number of hotel guests, especially at this time of year. They should have made it bigger as there is some kind of large generator/pump taking up over half of the roof. Bar prices are good and the snacks menu is reasonably priced too. Location is good, only 5 minute walk from the 'beach' (I expected better beaches in Split) and there are lots of places to ea nearby.

The 'fresh spring rolls' are actually cold and the pad Thai was a little sloppy. The dumplings were ok and my mum enjoyed her sticky chicken.

Communal areas were night and the room was clean. It was a little dated and the shower pressure was terrible, a trickle a best! I had to turn the other shower head on that was attached to the bath taps and use both to wash my hair. Bar was open late so we could get water when we arrived back from the wedding. There was a prom being held there the first night of our stay, so it took 20mins to get out the carpark. They need to look at the road system around the hotel so that guests aren't affected when there are events on at the hotel. Couldn't hear any noise from the prom the first night. Good location, near to plenty of shops, restaurants and supermarkets. It was absolutely fine for what we needed it for.

The pool area is lovely, food at the breakfast buffet was tasty and varied and the hotel is within a reasonable walk or taxi ride to some restaurants at the pier, if you wanted to eat out at night. Alcohol was a little pricier but that's what you expect from hotel bars, although the cocktails we had were good. We also paid a visit to the spa, which was reasonable priced and very relaxing. A must do while you stay here. Unfortunately, it is not a 5* hotel for me as there are some key areas where it lacks. The cleanliness is just not good enough. The problem with our initial room was that it was filthy. There was still makeup from the previous occupant in the bathroom and it looked as though the skirting boards and surfaces hadn't been dusted for months. They sent a cleaner to redo it, however, I am not convinced they did anything. We were upgraded the next day (nice touch from management) and the room was acceptably clean, however, still not at a standard I would expect from a 5* hotel. The hotel rooms were also quite tired. A lick of paint wouldn't go amiss! Other than that, a comfortable stay.

We ordered onion Bhajis, sheek kebabs, a chicken kadai and butter chicken with a garlic naan and rice. More than enough food for both of us and it was super tasty, especially the naan! It was a reasonable price too. All this food plus 2 rounds of drinks were £25! I just wish we had found it earlier on in our holiday.

Attentive staff and the food arrived quickly. Unfortunately, the food was only OK. There is better to be had in Fishermans wharf. We ordered a steak and the burger. My husband said the steak was ok. My burger was a bit bland. Chips were ok. Price was good in comparison to that in the hotel (staying at the Westin) and it is only a short 10 minute walk.

We saw some good reviews on Trip Advisor and the menu looked appealing so we gave it a try. We were definitely not disappointed! The food was delicious (we had chicken satay, claypot noodles and beef rendang) and the beer was a good price. The meal and 2 beers came to just under £20, less than half what you pay in the hotel. The staff were very friendly and the food arrived quickly. We will definitely be returning throughout the week!!

I can honestly say that the Mandarin Oriental KL is, without a doubt, the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Upon arrival, the lady at reception acknowledged my birthday and gave us an upgrade to a club room overlooking the Petronas Towers. This was just the start of the excellent service. Every member of staff greets you with a smile and go above and beyond to make your stay perfect. The food of simply phenomenal (separate review of Mosaic restaurant submitted) and the extras you get from being in a club room would 100% be worth the extra money. I would not hesitate to stay here again if I was ever back in KL, and I will tell anyone that will listen that they must stay here at least once!

Maybe we chose badly from the menu but 3/5 is us being generous. The positives:The atmosphere was good, the music in particular. The staff were friendly enough and tried to resolve our issues to the best of their ability. That is where the positives stop. When we first arrived we were sat just outside the restaurant. Outside is a busy mall where apparently you are allowed to smoke. As non-smokers, We asked to be moved and within a few minutes we weremoved inside the restaurant. My husband ordered pizza, which he said was OK. I ordered chicken fajitas. Although the filling was fine, the menu said they came with tortillas. They arrived with pitta breads. Not the end of the world, although you couldn't actually open the pittas to put the chicken mix inside. I asked for tortillas as the menu said, or for the pittas to be replaced so that I could actually put the chicken inside them. They replaced my whole meal, but this time instead of pittas, I got small pieces of chapati. I couldn't be bothered to argue so just tried my best to eat them. To the staffs credit, they took the fajitas off our bill. It didn't really make up for substandard food and the fact that my husband had finished his pizza before I even got my fajitas. Not really the couples meal we had planned. The dessert was, again, just OK. Wouldn't eat here again.

There was a broad selection of food and all of it was so tasty. For the price you pay (there is discount for hotel guests), it can not be faulted. Trying to talk my husband in to returning for a second night, however, we are still so full from eating so much the first time around! If you are used to all you can eat buffets in the USA, I would say this pips Caesars Palace to the number 1 spot

We ordered the fries, ribs and nasi goreng. More than enough food for 2 and it was so tasty. My husband said they were the best ribs he has ever had! The service was excellent too. The staff helped us decide what to have, made sure we didn't order too much and all looked happy to be working there. We also got a little souvenir :) Definitely would recommend it !!!

From here you can get to almost anywhere in the centre of Singapore. We got upgraded to an Urban room as the trip was for my birthday. We had more than enough space and the bed was VERY comfy. We had B&B. The breakfast was good with a wide variety. The only thing that let the hotel down was the service at breakfast. On the first day, my husband had to ask 3 times for coffee. It only came at the end of our meal. On the second day, I accident,y dropped a glass, which a waitress saw me do. I don't mind cleaning it up because it was my fault, however, she just walked away with no offer of help and no offer of towels to help. I had to clean it up with my napkin. Pool area was lovely & relaxing. My husband used the gym, which he found well equipped. We would stay here again if we were ever back in Singapore.

The first time I stayed here, I did get slightly disturbed sleep due to noises with the pipes when it rained. This time, there was no rain so my sleep was good. We also got a room upgrade due to it being my mums birthday. We had a lovely private terrace with a lounger. The hotel is still clean and has everything you need. Including a little area where you can get fruit juice, tea, coffee... all complimentary. The only slight downside is that the sink is in the bedroom, not the bathroom. This was ok except when you go to the toilet in the middle of the night, you end up waking up whoever is in the room with you when you wash your hands. This isn't enough for me to mark it down to a 4, it's just something for the hotel to think about... Enjoyed my stay and would stay here again.

We didn't get off to the best start. I had made a reservation over Trip Advisor, which they didn't know anything about. No matter, as they had space for us anyway. Food was good, with decent portion sizes. We had a bottle of wine, which was reasonably priced as well. Would return here.

The food is always good, especially the steak roll starters! However, the last time I went there was a very public incident between some waiters. We got no apology from Management regarding the disturbance caused and the delay to service. Not what I would expect with such a small restaurant. The manager was the one who took our money at the end and she didn't even mention it. I personally think that it was poor service. I will visit again but the management need to better understand what to do when there is a situation! 
RachelM087|E06A5122EA93831A97DC873EDF4BD9B6|Restaurant|Bicester: Wildwood|4| “Visit with friends ”|review_463873452|Visited Wildwood at the end of February with my husband & some friends. The waiters English was either poor or he had the worst memory. There were only 4 of us and probably another 7 occupied tables in the restaurant, but he managed to get the starter order and the dessert order wrong. They were more than happy to swap the meals and they did this quickly. The food was of a good standard for the price and the atmosphere was pleasant. We would go back but would suggest the waiting staff write down the orders that are being made as to avoid wastage! 
RachelM087|E06A5122EA93831A97DC873EDF4BD9B6|Hotel|Bordeaux: Quality Hotel Bordeaux Centre|4| “Great Location ”|review_456685686|We had an enjoyable stay. We did not spent much time in the hotel but it was clean and comfortable. The location is brilliant. We could reach everything we wanted to see by foot. The reason I can not give it 5 is because we had a corner room on the 2nd floor, as it was further away from reception, we were unable to connect to the wifi in the room. This made planning our day a little more difficult. I would also recommend ladies taking their own hair dryer. The one that is provided is not powerful enough, especially if you have a lot of hair!! We would stay here again if we ever found ourselves back in Bordeaux
RachelM087|E06A5122EA93831A97DC873EDF4BD9B6|Hotel|Nusa Dua: The Ritz-Carlton, Bali|2| “Disappointing”|review_424249707|I would normally wait until after I have left a hotel to write a review, however, I am so disappointed that I could not wait until I arrived home. My husband and I booked a relaxing trip to Bali, with a bit of peace and quiet in mind. We started off in Ubud and, quick frankly, we wish we had stayed there. The Ritz-Carlton bills itself as a top class, 5* resort and it falls quite far off the mark. For a beach front resort, it is impossible to swim in the sea. I could cope with the vast amount of seaweed but it is also full of rubbish and plastic. This can't be hygienic. That wouldn't be a problem if you could relax in the pool, however, the pool is way too small for the size of the resort. This meant that kids were screaming and jumping all over us (there are LOTS of children). During our time here we have had no relaxing moments. They need to create an outdoor 'adults only' pool to allow couples and honeymooners that quiet time alone. There is an indoor spa pool, but we came all this way for sun so didn't want to sit inside all day. We ate in the tapas bar on the first night. The food was average at best and ridiculously over priced for what you got. Breakfast food was ok, however, it feels way too much like a disorganised canteen rather than a 5* resort. The only saving grace for this hotel is the rooms themselves. The bed is really comfy and the amenities are good. The lobby is also stunning, with the most spectacular view over the resort. I would not recommend this hotel for couples looking for a relaxing break away. If you travel 26 hours for this resort like we did, then you will be disappointed.
RachelM087|E06A5122EA93831A97DC873EDF4BD9B6|Restaurant|Tegalalang: Aruna Restaurant|3| “Ok food with speckles of poor service ”|review_423668031|We stayed at the Tejaprana Resort for 4 nights. The restaurant was the only down side to our holiday as we thought everything else about the hotel was perfect, and I hate to be the first review of the restaurant and give it less than perfect, but here it goes... breakfast was included in our stay and was good. However, one morning my husband asked for extra bread with his breakfast. We waited 15 minutes and asked the waiter where it was, he said it wouldn't be long. Obviously by this time, my husband has eaten his food. Another 10 minutes went by so we left the restaurant, fed up of waiting (bread should not take this long). 15 minutes later we had a knock on our hotel room door... room service had come to bring the bread to us and seemed genuinely shocked that my husband no longer wanted it. Why would he want dry toast with no butter etc over 30 minutes after he ordered it? Afternoon Tea was also included with our stay. The same waiter that had served us at breakfast was our waiter again. He made no eye contact with me whatsoever and only took my husbands drink order and left without asking what I wanted. He returned with 2 coffees, one for me and one for my husband (this is what my husband ordered). I don't drink coffee so I didn't want it. He seemed shocked that I didn't want it but I didn't order it in the first place. Afternoon Tea then came, but only 1 plate for my husband! I couldn't believe it. It felt as if I had been transported back to the 1800's! We ate dinner in Aruna once, it was fine but we had better meals elsewhere.

What a view! There were also comfortable sun loungers to watch the come over the trees. The plunge pool was a little cold at first, but you soon adjusted to it. The staff, particularly those at reception, were lovely and could not do enough to help. Breakfast was good, although I am going to review the restaurant separately as we had a few issues but don't think this should impact on how we felt about the hotel. Complimentary taxi to Ubud was great and we used it most nights. If we were ever back in Bali, we would definitely stay here again.

When they arrived, it looked and tasted like dirty water. My husband asked whether they had forgotten to put the creme de cacao in the drink, only to be told by the waitress that they don't use creme de cacao like the menu said but instead just used chocolate flavoured vodka. That's not a chocolate martini though, is it? Beyond me how hey think it's ok to say one thing on the menu but give you something different! We sent the drinks back and they gave us different cocktails which were OK. The setting is lovely with a nice view but sadly would not return

We were not disappointed. The food was amazing! A bit of a mix with the traditional Balinese main course and French desserts but both courses tasted great. The seating arrangements were unique as well, sat on the 'floor', on cushions around a table. No complaints about the service either. We tried the get a table the first night but they were super busy, so we booked for the next night. Would definitely recommend

The room was great and the bed was so comfortable. The facilities were also good, pool, spa etc. Two things let it down for me. The showers in the room and by the pool were terrible, very little pressure. Breakfast was also a let down. The sausages were really gristly with large, hard, inedible chunks in them!! If I had paid £17 for it, I would have been annoyed. My husband enjoyed his eggs Benedict but, again, it would not have been worth £17.I would stay here again but perhaps skip breakfast!

It was our third visit in 6 years and is one of the only hotels we have ever returned to. Both our previous visits we gave it 5/5, however, a few things have slipped since our last visit (although we still very much enjoyed our stay) The food was the biggest issue for us. Breakfast was great but the selection at lunch and dinner is not as good as it used to be. The quality is still good but it gets very samey after 2 weeks. I also have a courgette allergy and they put it in everything!! We generally tried to sit in the same section in the restaurant because we found a waiter we liked. Jeremiah (sorry if it's spelt wrong!) is an extremely friendly and efficient gentleman and is a major credit to the waiting team in the restaurant. There were some days when his section was full and we had to sit elsewhere. On these occasions, we found the service slow and unfriendly. There were many times when we asked for drink refills that never arrived. The bar staff are great and are more than happy to make you something off the menu.As mentioned in other reviews, the trees around the pool do need cutting back a bit. We love the jungle feel to this hotel but the amount of sunny areas around the pool has declined over the last few years. Hopefully this will get sorted when it has a facelift.I do hope they leave the general feel of the hotel as it is. I love the authentic feel to the Tequila and changing it to the same style as the hotels across the road would be a shame. It only needs a lick of paint and a bit of love and it would be perfect again. We will probably return again in a few years times one the renovation is complete (providing they don't change too much!)

When it did arrive, the chips were over cooked and the burger tasted like it had all the burnt bits that had been left on the grill from all the other burgers coating it. They then took ages to clear our table and get us the bill. Would have had a better meal from McDonalds next door. Milkshake was the only redeeming thing, but even they were £5 each.

The hotel was pleasant and the grounds were well maintained. Great cocktails during happy hour while relaxing on the beach. Food in the restaurant was good too. The negative for me was the smell in the rooms. What ever the air freshener is that they use smells disgusting.

Not so. they take you on a tram that goes around the zoo for about an hour with an instructor talking relentlessly about the sleeping animals. Perhaps the trekking paths may be interesting.. but nothing great about this.

They have rooms with three themes for our choice.. We picked the Kingdom theme. Each room come with a bedroom for adults and a bunk-bed room for kids. The entire hotel is decorated with lego themes and there is colors everywhere. Looks amazing and so inviting for the kids to stay and enjoy the tons of legos in the hotel lobby. The breakfast spread is HUGE for a sumptuous food enough until 2pm at least. A must stay more than the legoland theme park itself.All of these come at a huge cost.. quite an expensive hotel.

I have been to many of World's best ones in US, Japan and elsewhere. I had low expectations from this Zoo due to that but was in for pleasant surprise. Some rare animals like otters, tree kangaroo, puma, mouse deer, tucan etc were an eye-treat. Loved the importance given to an Orangutan names 'Al Meng' that adorned the zoo for over 40 years until it died few years ago whose funeral was attended by over 4000 people. Shows the love for animals and how much it was celebrated in the zoo.

Check-in was a breeze and the double-bed room was quite spacious than I had seen in many hotels with all required amenities (wifi up to 7 devices). More importantly, they had a mobile phone that you can use for your local trips. I loved this arrangement and so thoughtfully made available for guests. Very good breakfast spread but mostly continental and chinese food. Amongst all the good points, couple of suggestions to the hotel: I would recommend to have a good mix of Indian food as well due to local population and many tourists from India. As I had booked through a third party site and hence I was deprived of IHG points.I highly recommend this hotel.

I had to complain about an Italian dish as it tasted and smelt very old.. they didn't care. Safely avoid this place.. but just climb up the stairs and take good pictures of the fort.. except the views there is nothing great to write.

Belonging to the Chokhi Dhani group of hotels.. they have recently renovated this place and the tents are very comfy.. don't expect A/c yet but the tent has all the essentials neatly organized... the interiors of the campus is full of local heritage. Suggest to go here only in the late evening, stay the night and leave next morning. Don't plan for day stay here.. incorrigible weather. Slightly expensive though compared to other desert tents around (there is plenty actually) but very decent place, food is served inside (both breakfast & dinner) and they arrange for desert safari. So you don't have to bargain nor go anywhere in search of pleasures.

The entrance ticket counter sells tickets not just for entrance, the elevator to take you to top level, camera and a local guide. I strongly suggest to get a guide (for one it is pre-paid and hence no bargain and a localite who knows his strengths).Great stories of how kings had a wonderful time with their family.. lots of wives, privacy and tons of expensive gifts given and taken, there is just opulence everywhere. The view of the 'Blue City' that Jodhpur is is breath-taking.. all of them are Brahmin houses just to identify themselves separately.. built long ago and still well maintained. The view of the Umaid Bhavan from here is equally great in a clear sky day. A must visit place.

The setup is on a lawn under the shade of Neem tree which is brilliant. The best part ends here. The service was found wanting with waiters just walking around along with their supervisors and not catering to guests. Order took a little long time than normal to get delivered.. so you better go early and order quickly if you are really hungry. Taste is just so-so but very pricey. If you have better options in the town, you can safely skip this.

The hotel exteriors are very deceiving with heritage looking building but it ends here.. the rooms are pretty ordinary like any other 3 star hotel. Nothing special. Drive to the hotel (as per Google GPS maps) took us through a small lane passing through an old graveyard.. so watchout. When I entered the hotel after a long drive in hot weather, entrance did look great.. checkin could've been better. I was asked to make full payment upfront.. not sure why.. never did it in any other star hotel before. I had booked through an online portal and had requested for a lake-view room.. I asked for it just to confirm and the lady at the reception did confirm that it is indeed lake facing room.. Got the keys.. entered the room.. cosy one.. eagerly opened the window curtains to look outside.. only to be TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED.. there were marshlands and the lake was quite far away and there is absolutely no 'View'. (check photos attached). I felt duped. Long story short - I wouldn't stay here again.

A small town about one hour drive from Jaipur.. enter the town, get past the new town houses until you see the old fashioned village of Nathdwara.. you will see Goshala, Gowri pond and after a short walk alongside the shops you will see the majestic temple entrance. Highly secure place- they will take away your camera, mobile and other gadgets. Weekends will have good crowd.. worth the wait to see the baby Shrinathji.. WHAT A WONDERFUL diety.. I couldn't take my eyes off.. until someone pushed me due to crowd.. Don't miss to walk around the temple to get the history of the place and the small jhoola where Kishenji is made to sleep by singing lullaby.

It was a great time. We have already been to Universal Studios in Los Angeles and Orlando. Although not quite as big, there was still plenty to do in 2 days. We took someone's advice from Trip Advisor and bought the 6 month pass with fast entry also. It is cheaper than buying 2 separate one day passes (there are no 2 days passes - only one day and then 6 months). We also got 10% discount on all F&B in Universal plus on any other purchases. It was worth paying for the fast pass otherwise the most popular rides you could be waiting for up to one hour to get on. We only had to wait a maximum of 5 minutes! I highly recommend Universal Studios, Singapore as a a great theme park that is well run.

It is a beautiful time of the evening in Cordova and I got some great photos. Next door is the 10,000 Roses cafe which we visited to see the LED roses lighting up as the sun went down.There were a LOT of people arriving for dinner at Lantaw. Surprisingly, we got a table for 2 straight away. Staff were very attentive and friendly. Our orders were taken quite promptly and our waiter told us that it would be ready in 35 minutes approximately. We thought that was unusual to be given a time and we wondered how accurate it would be. Well, they brought out our meals in about 25 minutes - except for our stir fry vegetables, which came 5 minutes later. I was very happy with the quality of the food, especially the freshly cooked butter prawns and stir fry veggies - very delicious!The view was spectacular at night. There was a pleasant sea breeze all the time which made the outdoor dining quite comfortable. It is a family friendly restaurant with lots of family and large groups eating and laughing together. My wife and really enjoyed visiting. It was difficult getting a taxi back to our hotel. We found out that other diners asked their taxis to stay until they were finished dining and of course paying them per hour to stay. Apart from that we had a great time.

We chose the Mercure Sydney because we are Accor Plus members and also because we were going to a concert at the Enmore Theatre and did not want to travel too far afterwards.We were very happy with our choice! There was a bus that left George street and dropped us off right at the front of the Enmore. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, going out of their way to serve us. The hotel was very easy to get to, being right near Central station. We were able to explore Chinatown the next day and walk up to Hyde Park etc. We were on the 13th floor so we had a great view of the centre of the city. Certainly not a harbour view but we didn't go there for that!We also ate at their 4 Elements restaurant on Saturday night and we REALLY enjoyed the meal. They gave us a free glass of champagne each because it was our wedding anniversary. In our hotel room there was a 375 ml bottle of red wine. We took it to dinner with us and we had it for free (otherwise if you drank it in your room you had to pay for it). I thought that it would be a cheap red, but it was a beautiful Hunter Valley wine.

We were NOT disappointed. There were no tables available outside yet they made one free all of a sudden! The restaurant was not too busy and but there were still quite a few people there which made for a great atmosphere. Right next to us was a table of Italian men who were laughing and eating non-stop. A man came playing an accordian looking for money which added to the atmosphere. The wait staff were very attentive, friendly and patient with us - they even provided a side table for us because we ordered too much food and drink at once. We had such a GREAT time there we didn't want to leave. Each course was great and even though we ordered too much we still managed to fit in dessert which was divine!

The meal was different because there was no pizza or pasta which was nice for a change. My son missed having pizza because that is what he loves (although there was plenty of bread) but the rest of us had a wonderful meal. I highly recommend an evening at Cibreo Trattoria. It was a great family outing and certainly a memorable experience. The photo is one of the main courses - stuffed chicken neck and head with a sauce.

It will depend on what flavours you choose of course.

If you are inclined, you can do a 'pilgrims walk' around the Basilica and surrounding grounds by following a map. The religious artwork is incredible. Very impressive. There were a lot of devout Catholics there, not so many touristy people. Definitely worth a visit.

After some research I decided on Vesuvius vs Pompeii tours. It was the BEST decision!Roberta was our private tour guide for both days. From the moment she met us Roberta took every effort to look after us, making sure we were okay. She included my 2 teens in everything and made us feel special. We were a small group so we could go places that larger groups could not go. Both Pompeii and Capri were full of large tourist groups from cruise ships. Without Roberta we would have been completely lost. She also brought Naples alive for us, taking us through the streets and explaining everything to us. We visited the underground Roman city that was only discovered in the 1980's!With Roberta's help Italy has become a place we will never forget and a place we want to return to. Grazie mille!

We had the most wonderful experience learning to cook traditional Italian food. Isa is SO warm and friendly - we felt at home straight away! She explained everything carefully and made sure we ALL learnt hands on. We were able to agree upon the menu before the day because we corresponded via email, discussing our likes and dislikes. The tiramisu we made with Isa's guidance was amaazing! I highly recommend Mama Isa as a great chef and teacher.Thank you Isa, we will never forget you!!

Both were amazing and well worth every Euro!Susan was our guide on the intro to Venice. She was very informative and engaging, especially with my 2 teens! There was only 6 in our group which was perfect, walking the small streets of Venice. I highly recommend this tour and Susan as a guide. The gondola ride at the end is also fun and relaxing.Moses was our guide for the After hours Doge's Palace and the Basilica. Moses was an incredible source of information! Also very enthusiastic about history and art. It was a great privilege to visit the Basilica after all other tourists had left.

We had to wait over 20 minutes on the street before a table was available for us. When we finally got in, the service was very prompt and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. We ordered drinks, including coffee, while waiting for our food and it arrived in less than 5 minutes. There seemed to be a LOT of staff around which was good. So customer service was exceptional. Food was enjoyable with generous portions but not amazing - I've had better food elsewhere for similar or less prices. But the decor was interesting and comfortable, it was easy to have a conversation as a group of 4 and we enjoyed ourselves. It wasn't a cheap eat but nice for a special occasion.

I had read about it in the Australian Good Food Guide and it sounded interesting, with the focus on fresh, local food.We made a reservation, which was just as well because the place was completely full with people waiting outside by the time we left. We arrived at 11.30 am, but there was already a large table of people seated at the front of the restaurant. We got a quiet table for 2 near the back of the restaurant which was very nice. The wall we were seated next to was stacked with 2nd hand books which you could buy.The ceiling had asian style umbrellas hanging upside down. There were also numerous drawings on the walls. It was quite interesting decor! Each table was covered with white drawing paper and crayons were supplied. My wife and I spent some time drawing some silly pictures whilst waiting for our food, We found this quite enjoyable!The food itself was absolutely delicious with a meditteranean influence. Delicious fresh salad and meat that was cooked perfectly! Extremely tasty. We also had a lovely dessert.We found the customer service good - the staff were friendly, helpful and attentive. They were able to advise us on the menu and recommended something that suited us. The waiter overheard my wife looking for a blue crayon and he brought it over without being asked. This is only a very small detail but it pleased my wife and shows that the staff are thinking of their customers.Overall it was a great experience for us and we recommend a visit.

It was very relaxing just to eat and talk as a family. Later our 2 kids (early teens) walked around the grounds of the vineyard whilst my wife and I visited the cellar door for some wine tasting which was also a nice experience. There was a log fire and arm chairs in the tasting room as well, which providing a lovely atmosphere. All the staff were extremely polite, welcoming and friendly.

It is extremely comprehensive and there is LOTS of memorabilia. It is a very practical and interactive museum, great for all ages. You could easily spend hours there, taking all that information in. It really is a MUST SEE when in the Southern Highlands even if you don't like cricket. I was very impressed with how the museum is set up and how it encourages people to interact and learn.

I discovered that every Monday night the Scottish Arms provides their Chicken Schnitzel meals for $15. (We were visiting from Sydney). The Hotel was easy to find in East Bowral. It had great Scottish decor and memorabilia, including bits of scottish history within the bistro itself.When the Schnitzel's arrived they were HUGE! Seriously! And they were absolutely delicious and well cooked. Chips and salad came with the schnitzel so we were all very full. But we all wanted dessert despite this. The desserts also were fantastic! I ordered the dutch apple pie which was FULL of apple and had a very light pastry. This was exactly what I wanted after a heavy protein meal. The rest of the family really enjoyed their choice of dessert as well. I also enjoyed their Scottish beer which they had on tap. Great value night and great experience.The staff were also very helpful and friendly!

We enjoyed our stay there, it was very comfortable. There was absolutely no problem with noise from outside or from other apartments. Despite the cold weather we were very warm inside with central heating which we could control and also a gas heater which looks like a log fire (the kids wanted a REAL fire so they were a bit disappointed!). The heated pool was great for us - in the afternoons we would go for a swim in the indoor heated pool which was fun and also good exercise.The apartment was very clean and neat on arrival with plenty of towels, spare blankets, quilts and pillows. It is not cleaned daily, but we had a midweek clean because we stayed longer than a week and the cleaners did a great job doing that while we were out for the day.The full kitchen was great and so was the full laundry with washer and dryer hidden away behind folding doors. We were able to shop at Woolworths (2 minute drive away) and keep the food costs down over the week. We still enjoyed visiting a few local restaurants of course!The only minor drawback was the WiFi which was very expensive - $10/hour or $30/day. It is a shame that free WiFi could not be organised for the apartments. I did not bother to use the WiFi because of the price - my mobile data on my phone was much cheaper!
qwertylinda|4ACF2B9E54E3AA9AEF9D6A6B6FBD73B0|Restaurant|Singapore: Old Chendu|1| “Turn around & get out!”|review_481028293|On my last night in Singapore I wanted to try there famous Chili Crab. Having stayed in Chinatown I decided to to head on in to Old Chendu. Worst mistake I wish I turned around & got out!So upon entering I was ushered upstairs & sat down. I noticed the chili crab was $7/100g, so I enquirer what was the smallest crab. The waitress said it was 700g. As I only wanted to taste this dish I declined. Miraculously the crab shrunk 100g so I decided to bite the bullet. The food started to come out, they brought out these mini bread rolls & said to eat them with the crab sauce. Neither of us ordered these so we thought it may have been included with the crab..... no it was not! (Only discovered this upon paying the bill). As most would know eating crab is messy & challenging. I was given a pair of pliers, chopsticks & one wet one.After what seemed like a long time I gave up in defeat. As I now had chili sauce all over my hands I asked for another set one, the waitress said no it was too expensive & handed over napkins. Mind you the fricking crab cost me $45!!!. The napkins did nothing to help. I decided to wait until the one toilet was free to wash my hands prior to paying. The wait was long & the wait staff looked eager to get rid of us. Eventually another waitress handed me another wet one. The service was terrible, one could say non existent. The chairs looked like they had been salvaged from a draught, moldy looking & all patched up. Well how was the food?... it was pretty average. I can get better quality from my local for far cheaper.Overall such a disappointing experience. Do yourself a favour, turn around & get out. Go somewhere else.

The team were lovely, very accommodating & friendly. The hotel was clean,the decor was very beautiful & nicely air conditioned. The hotel also provided complimentary water bottles daily, which was handy when venturing out. I can not comment on the meals as only ate there once for breakfast (which was pricey as we didn't not get it included). The hotel also had a small gym which had two cardio equipments, free weights, weight machine & a couple of fit balls. Suited me just fine, although air conditioned also can get quite stuffy. There was also an outdoor Jacuzzi available.The location was ideal for us. We found that most of the places we wanted to explore where close to Chinatown, such as Universal Studios, Chinatown Markets, Marina Bay & more. Fairly close to the airport & a 5 minute stroll to the train station. Overall a beautiful place to stay, friendly team, great location. Would stay there again without any hesitation.

So needed passport to enter, no big deal. As soon as we walked in the smell of cigarette smoke it you in the face. They allow smoking in designated areas of the casino. Again not a problem to some, personally I found it off putting. Comparing this casino to others it felt like it had no vibe. Left within an hour.Could not see anywhere to eat inside, you could go out of the casino into Marina Bay to grab a bite. You would need to line up again to show your passport.

The rides were great, The Transformer & Cylon were the best. We ended up buying the express pass which added an extra $50 onto the cost of entry; however it paid off for us on the day. Keeping in mind we went at off peak season. Easy to get the train there. As expected the food & beverages can get a little pricey, after all it is a theme park. Worth the $$, had a blast☺️

Cauvery Resorts had dormitory which could take care of this. What surprised me was, it has very basic amenties but everything working. For example, most common issue in these areas is hot water, they would have solar water heaters but due to weather conditions, probably 2-3 can take bath with hot water. Post that it would be cold water. But this place had alternate arrangements for it. Vidyadhar is the person who runs this place and made all his efforts to make our stay very comfortable.

Keep track of the different shows/events which happens in different places inside USS. Better to start at 10 am so that you have little less crowd. One major sour about the place was no options of Vegetarian food at all. We hardly found one place selling Veggie food. Probably something for the management to look out for. Better to buy the tickets online to beat the queue. Also if you are in hotels where they provide handy phones, then booking from it will also give discounts.

Unfortunately, every new experience is worse than the previous one!The rooms are shoddy, furniture worn out and the wash rooms cannot be more basic!My first room had a non-functional (split) air conditioner. I had to change a room and the second room (with central air-conditioning) did not cool either! After complaining to the Duty Manager, the filter was cleaned and there was moderate improvement in performance. When I returned late at night, there was no cooling again! I suspect the temperature was set high (or the condenser switched off) to save on costs! There are no air-conditioner controls in the room - other than switch on/off!To add insult to injury, extremely noisy renovation of the hotel was being undertaken on one of the floors. As a guest, I did not pay the hotel to bear this kind of torture!Moti Mahal is beyond it's sell-by-date!

Boating, sun bathing, carousel rides, sport matches, horse or bike tours, walks or just people watching. It is such a unique setting being perfectly rectangular and bounded by high rise buildings, as well as being so large. A joy and full of interest like the Alice in Wonderland statue and the John Lennon memorial.

The waxworks were as I remembered, some very lifelike and some not, but the experience is what makes it. The settings are well thought out to allow interaction - we particularly liked the ghostbusters section and the 4D marvel show and they have some good cocktails half way through for us adults. I enjoyed it much more than I expected.

We waited in line for nearly 2 hours to board - one poor lady fainted in line - in over 90 degree heat. They ran out of food before the last 40 people were served and therefore we paid extra and waited for 45 minutes in line for potato salad and a stale roll. They also suggest that you get a better view on this cruise rather than the cheaper one, but that is simply not true. I would suggest that you pay the cheaper price and bring a folding chair or better still, watch it on Tv.
itspji|3AFAB6275770C3C4AE8C2EE96BD469D0|Attractions|New York City: Gray Line New York Sightseeing|1| “The Worst !”|review_498729920|We bought the sightseeing pass for five days (of hell). We read the reviews and it seemed ok, but be warned that several of the attractions require you to queue at the gray line office to exchange your voucher for another voucher, which you then have to queue at the attraction to exchange for a real ticket - they don't tell you that ! If you are unhappy, don't bother going to their main office as they could not care less and simply treat you as an imbecile; telling you to read the book. We had read the book incidentally, which missed out many details such as when you redeem the passes, they have to be used the same day. After reducing my wife to tears they had the cheek to try selling us time share. Apart from that it includes the hop(eless) bus service. There are some good guides and drivers - Marty who did the night tour was excellent and almost made up for the two hours we had to queue to get on in 90 degree heat. The service itself is less frequent than the other companies, often full and involves you spending a good portion of your day in a queue. Being fair we visited in the Summer at a busy time, but Big Bus and Open Loop seemed to cope much better. If their buses are full, you go downstairs or wait for an indeterminable time period for another; in the heat being downstairs is unbearable as many have no opening windows and you cannot see out for the advertising painted over them. In short, don't buy a pass unless you don't sleep and like standing in line forever and use the Big Bus Company instead if you want a hop-on hop-off service that works reasonably well. It will be unlikely now that we will return to New York as a result of this company's inadequacies.

There is no pool but the setting is beautiful and the staff are really lovely. The restaurant is great and buffet style in the evening and there is really no alternative, given its location. Be aware that there is only wifi in the bar and reception and it is VERY slow.

You need two to three hours to do it justice. The ticket machine randomly assigns you as white or non-white and there are two different entrances to use accordingly. It is a bit of a maze, but there a lot of video clips, articles and information to read. Take your time and follow the story through, as it clears up the full horror of the regime and the reasons behind its rise and fall.

The hotel is movie themed and has lots of silver, white and black all around. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable with quirky open plan bathrooms - beware of sharing with someone you don't know well. The milkshake bar caters for adults and children alike and my wife can attest to the taste and strength of the adult ones - delicious. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Be aware that the pool is closed at the moment and it is a busy hotel in the bar and restaurant area. The hotel sits in a secure gated community with many shops and restaurants, so is very safe to walk around at night.

The rooms are comfortable and quirky, if a little smaller than at some Protea hotels. The outdoor pool is across the carpark and the only disabled access is in the carpark, which taxis and coaches cannot access - very silly and awkward. Most rooms have no real view to speak of. The complimentary internet has a very small daily cap and you really have to pay for unlimited access, which is a little slow. Our laundry was also not delivered on time and when I went to speak to reception, only half of it was initially delivered. Worth staying here, but a few minor kinks that the Hotel needs to work out.

There was only a twin available when I booked and the `person checking us in asked if we wanted a king sized bed instead, which we did. He organised a room change after we got up the next morning, into an upgraded room which was excellent. The hotel has 4 restaurants or cafes and a lovely little pool attached to the spa. The staff are all lovely and help in any way they can, but the thing that makes a real difference for me is when all staff, housekeeping, waiting staff, etc engage with you and chat to make you feel welcome. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a comfortable stay with a little bit of luxury and a warm greeting.
itspji|3AFAB6275770C3C4AE8C2EE96BD469D0|Attractions|Doha: Souq Waqif|5| “Quirky and interesting”|review_482873850|The Souq is a maze, but not so big, like some in Africa, that you could get lost. There are some great sections to it, like the bird Souq and it also has a falconry section. You really can get everything from tacky souvenirs to made-to-measure clothes, tortoises or falcons (although I don't approve) to food and drink. It is a must see in Doha and very picturesque at night.
itspji|3AFAB6275770C3C4AE8C2EE96BD469D0|Attractions|Doha: Doha Bus|4| “A good way to see what Doha has to offer”|review_482873098|We got a 24hour ticket for two at 360QAR ad it automatically had another day added, which was great. There is a second line with no audio commentary and a night tour, which is the day tour at night. It was a relaxing, if very hot, way to see what is going on. Be aware that most of the city is one big building site at the moment getting ready for the 2020 FIFA world cup and for building more attractions. The museum, Kataar village and one or two other parts of the tour are not built, although apparently they should have been 2 years ago. The tour is worth while and lets you see what there is at the moment. The only thing that would help, as one or two others have said, would be a timetable. I have to say that the staff were all really helpful and radioed to find out when buses would arrive. Your hotel can arrange a shuttle to get you there in the morning.
itspji|3AFAB6275770C3C4AE8C2EE96BD469D0|Attractions|Denpasar: Sunrise Bali Tour|2| “Saved by the dolphins”|review_482868366|We booked what looked like a great 2-day tour to see some of the culture of Bali, but our guide was disinterested in the temples and cut out two from the itinerary without mentioning it, then tried to talk us out of going to the holy water temple as well. He spent most of the time texting and using his phone and did not really act as a guide; more of a aid to getting us around. There was too much emphasis on visiting artisans who wanted you to buy, leaving little time for the more interesting visits. The jumping dolphins at Lovina are brilliant and should not be missed. The rain came down with a vengeance at lunch time on the second day and we missed the terraces, arriving at Tanah Lot early. There was never any suggestion of alternatives to replace what was missed and we returned very early without our second dinner. The trip is competitively priced although the guide tried to charge too much, they included dinners and our driver was excellent. Bali is beautiful and the idea of the tour is great, but make sure that your guide does their job.

If you have mobility issues, get there early and ask to be on the top level to avoid doing steps.
itspji|3AFAB6275770C3C4AE8C2EE96BD469D0|Hotel|Nusa Dua: Grand Hyatt Bali|4| “A beautiful Hotel”|review_482371717|This is a very large hotel set in beautiful grounds and on a nice stretch of beach. There are lots of places to eat and all restaurants are very good, although the Italian is a little uninspiring. The Japanese restaurant in particular is well worth a visit and VERY good. The rooms are a good size and the staff really cannot do enough to please. The only issues we found were that the drinks are very expensive and even in non-smoking rooms, people can smoke on the balcony which can get pretty bad in the humid conditions in Bali. We asked to move as we could not use our balcony due to a chain smoker and they were very good and gave us an excellent replacement within a couple of hours. The pool areas are very well thought out and have areas for adults and children alike and there is an excellent shopping complex over the road from the hotel entrance gate. Use the shopping area rather than the hotel shops if you are interested in saving a little money, although the hotel shops are very good. The spa is pricey, but well worth a visit if you are interested; we thoroughly enjoyed our treatments. There are a few bits and pieces that the hotel could improve on, but overall it is an excellent place to stay and we will definitely look to return in the future.

There are many small eateries outside to try like Kiliney, but the attached restaurant is worth a visit and makes a real effort with tasty breakfasts - make sure you get breakfast included. The staff are lovely and do everything they can to help your stay. There are parts that need a bit of a face lift, but they are working on that. The rooms are large and comfortable. The only potential issues are that it is set up more for business travellers so the Tv selection is very limited (typical for Singapore) and you need to grab a business card for taxi drivers to get you back. Overall great value and we thoroughly enjoyed our week.

It is ideally suited on the very edge of the cbd and right next to the iSight. There is an on-site laundry and parking, with complimentary wifi. The only down side is that the cleaning staff are a little forgetful and despite staying for a week, our bedding was never changed - hence the docking of one star on the rating.

The timetable was poorly thought out, so there were a lot of long waits at the connection points, although I have to say that the crescent tour on the palm was good. The night tour commentary was the same as for the day tours, so very disappointing and when we arrived at the stop for the river cruise, the captain let some of the passengers on, then seemed to get bored and left some of us standing in the heat. The bus driver had left before this, so there was no one to ensure that it took everyone. When we complained, the company response is that they take no responsibility for third party companies. Unfortunately it was too late in the day for us to wait for a later boat and we were leaving the next morning. Please also be aware that if you want to do all of the routes, you need to start as soon as they start running in the morning and it will take all day if you are on a 24 hour ticket. This is not clear in the company information.

We have always visited outlets, following our awesome experience when we visited similar concept outlet in the UK. Our trip up Genting was smooth, slow and steady. GPO is located nearby Awana Genting. The establishment is well planned in view of parking, for both cars and buses. The day we were there, there was an opening sale going on, hence there were many visitors as the day progressed. The eatery offers range of services from restaurant, to ice cream parlour, to food court. The locations of eatery outlet is convenient and easy access. My family enjoys scouting for value-added deals, thus our visit was a good bargain (since it was the opening sale). We found bargain for kids wear, mom's wallet, dad's perfume and kids chocolate treat. When we were done, we paid the parking fee, which in my opinion is slightly on high side. It was a pleasant GPO experience.

However, when we checked in, the staff assigned us different seats, because they say it us their policy to assign as group for 4 passangers travel together.Nonetheless, the ground staffs in departure area were considerate, arranged for family with small kids to board prior others. We had food on board. The packaging was difficult to pull apart. Food taste was ok. Legroom wise, for me was ok, but I suspect, not that comfortable for taller persons. Overall experience on Tigerair, was acceptable.

The food was good, mash potatos was nice, the salmon I ordered was delicious. The price, I reckon is in the normal range offered in SG i.e main dish in the range of SGD 16 to SGD 28. Waiting time for food to be served is around 10-15 minutes. Overall we were satisfied customers. Tq.

We searched for a venue that would offer easy access to halal food and transportation. We found this hotel meets both requirement. From Changi airport, we travelled MRT on the East West Line to Bugis station. We got ourselves the Singapore Tourist Pass which was perfect for a 3D2N holiday. We pay SGD 30 per person for unlimited travel for the duration. The pass will be refunded SGD10 each, if we return with receipt. Keep the receipt intact! When we arrived Bugis station, there was signages to direct us to the hotel. It was a meer two minutes walk, which is good for us. The room is clean and equipped with essentials. We enjoyed ourselves with the Nescafe Dolce Expresso, complimentary from the hotel. Other facility at the hotel include gym (opens 24 hr), swimming pool and self service laundry & dryer at SGD 10 each machine/cycle. Around the place are eatery such as meat joint, western and local food. 2 minutes walj brings us to the Sultan Mosque and Haji Lane which are famous among tourist.Tq Village Hotel and SG!

The restaurant is located in Ampang, a fairly busy place with some difficulty to find parking slot. When we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff who have us the menu card. So the way its done here, you have to choose the meat from the nearby freezer. On each meat, you will find information on type of meat, the weight and also the price of the meat. This way you can manage your budget wisely. The drinks are bottomless, to me that is a plus point. Nonetheless, the restaurant will penalise, if customers put the drinks to waste. We ordered lamb and grass feed meat, both were ordered well done. After 15 minutes, food arrived. The presentation is standard. But...the taste of each course, divine. Lovely taste and texture. Really satisfying with capital S. The price is affordable, and we highly recommend this place for a decent western dinner. Thumbs up!!

From the movie, the scene looked spectacular. We know that this place is only 45 minute -1 hour drive from our town, hence we decided to give it a try.The Boh Plantation is located in Sungai Palas, a small area in Cameron Highland. We used GPS to help us finding our way. When we reached the junction into the plantation, we were surprised to see that the road ahead was narrow. Driving along, one must exercise extreme caution. We were short of breath through out the 7 km ride. But alas, when we reached the site, it was breathtakingly beautiful. No wonder many took the pain on narrow road, just to capture the beauty of the tea plantation. No entrance fee on this one.Beauty and serene made us forget the narrow journey we had earlier.

The park is in Tanah Rata, roughly about 1 hour drive from Simpang Pulai, Perak. Ample car and bus parking space available.The park charges an entrance fee of RM3 per adult and RM1.50 per child. My first impression of the park is how much it resembles the concept of Araluen Botanic Park in Perth, Australia, minus the tulips of course. The park boasts the colourful flowers from daisy to hyderangea. In another part of the park, we can see grapes and strawberry along with some cafe that serves strawberry based menu ranging from ice cream, yogurt and pies. For muslim traveller, there is a solah venue for both male and female. This is great place to spend a lovely evening.

There were a lot of family rides with really awesome decorations and the scenic landscape of the disneyland castle, is the most magical above all. We were here end of summer, to our big surprise they opens at 8 a.m and close at 10 p.m. We bought our tickets online and it was a breeze at the entrance. Tokyo Disneyland allows food intended for a picnic, such as sandwiches, fruits, biscuits, your bottle of drinks etc, but I suppose not heavy meal. We could not find any halal food, hence please bring your picnic and tid-bits, ok. The one thing we enjoyed was the popcorn, they had many flavours, salty, butter, caramel, mocha, chocolate and surprisingly, curry too. Apart of the entire magical atmosphere, the parade is simply the best!! They had a really long and colourful parade despite the rain, earlier of the day. (You should see the dedication, the staff put into clearing the traces of rain from the parade track, it was an overwhelming experience). Tokyo Disneyland, you are simply the best!

It was end of summer, the weather was a hot. I was told, hot is good, :-). We travelled from KLIA to Haneda International Airport. Accessibility to township can be made via Metro or JR Lines. These are all trains, by the way. You must choose a mode to suit your budget. We bought Suica Card and took JR Line. The travel time was about 1 hour and we arrived the hotel, safely. The hotel is nicely located a 2 minute walking distance from the subway station and 5-7 minutes walking distance to JR station. The staff of the hotel are very polite, the spoke English very well. The room is clean and comfortable for our family. There is a swimming pool which we did not manage to enjoy. They have a nice cozy cafe which serves till dinner time. Speaking of food, there is one halal restaurant at the Cubic Plaza (5-7 minutes walk), located at level 9. The cost of dinner is in the range of 1200 - 1700 yen per person. The serving is good enough for an adult. Should you bring your own packed food, you can buy ready to eat rice at the 7-E store, some 3 minutes walk from the hotel. There are other convenience store nearby too. The tourist attraction nearby the hotel is the Ramen Museum where you dine in and vegetarian ramen menu is available too. Another atteaction would be the Nissan Stadium, home to the local footbal team. Tokyo is about 45 minutes on train rides. Worth it for muslim travel to Japan.

We booked the apartment via online but we were sure that it is located within the free bus service (CAT). The hotel is on the Red CAT route. It would be a great bargain to at least save some money to go to the city. When we reached the apartment, we were greeted by a friendly reception staff and quickly processed our check-in. The hotel is clean and considerably attractive decorations.The rooms are clean, equipped with 1 unit of washer and 1 unit of dryer. The only thing unavailable is the machine's manual or instruction to use the washer. I had to google the instruction over internet and luckily it was available. The utensils were all clean. We were satisfied with the condition of the hotel. The hotel has other facilities which we did not enjoy (due to sightseeing activities) such as gym, pool and free car park for guest. You can also purchase detergent for the washer at the reception. Now, the reason I say that the apartment offers value for money for muslim travel is due to the availability of a grocery outlet which sells halal meat i.e chicken, beef, sausages and such. Along with it, it sells rice, fresh vegetable, you name it. You can get just about anything from this store. That is if you intend to cook. If you don't, there is also a halal kebab outlet with great taste two or three doors away from the grocery outlet. Also available is a pharmacy, just in case you need PCM and such. Overall, my family and I have enjoyed our trip to Perth and would recommend to stay in this apartment. oh by the way, our family consist of 4 adults and two children.Thank you. Job well done.

The best ride for me was the Cylon, one of the Battlestar Galactica rides. It is a 2 seater ride with your feet dangling in the air. The first drop is scream worthy. I went on a weekday and was at the entrance 15 min before opening and got on almost all the rides in less than 5 minutes. We were able to ride all the man attractions except for the Jurassic park rapids adventure. Made the mistake of reserving it for last and had to wait for an hour. Unfortunately, the ride was cancelled due to inclement weather (lightning). It's pretty pricey but worth it if you can get on all or at least most of the main attractions. Sing$76, express additional $30. If you don't mind riding alone, take the single rider. Its free. The park is clean. Most people seem to come in the late afternoon when it is not too hot.

The standard rooms are small. We were first given a really small room with no desk space. The sink was right beside the bed and partly blocked by the night table. When my husband requested for a room with a desk we were immediately moved to a slightly larger one which was comfortable enough for 2 people. However, if you are a larger sized individual (6ft, 200 lbs) it will be a tight fit for 2. This room has no separate room for a full bathroom. The shower and water closet are separate and the sink is in front or beside the bed. No closet, just a small open cabinet to hang your clothes. Comfortable bed and pillows. Best part, all items in the mini bar are free and replenished daily. The hotel is very clean. The pool is a small lap pool, about 20m in length. The gym is tiny but complete. They also have a mobile phone with mobile data that you can bring around with you.It is located right in front of a mall called Vivo City where you can catch a train to Sentosa. I walked to Sentosa. It is less than a kilometer and is a nice place to walk. Well maintained. The train stations are nearby and it is very easy to get a cab in the area.

It is located just at as you enter the town. Parking is directly on the street in front of the restaurant and requires timing to get in and out as it is a main street. It is an old house (about 100 yrs if i remember correctly) and is now used as a B&B. The restaurant is small, quaint and gives you a feel of life in the days of old. One of the receptionist gave us a guided tour of the house while we waited for our meals. The food is very good. Pricey for the location. I believe it is the fine dining restaurant in the area. Prices range from over P150 to P400. Servings are only good for one person, not for sharing. We tried the hot choco and some pastries as well. The chocolates are good but I was not impressed with the sans rival. Yes I wouldn't mind having a meal there again. Best though to reserve if you plan to go during peak hours. It is a very small restaurant.

It is very clean and well-maintained, We stayed in the Santol room which is one of their deluxe rooms with en suite bathroom. The room was cozy with a very comfortable queen size bed. It faces the garden/restaurant so if there is a large crowd I can imagine that it can be difficult to sleeps. Fortunately there were no noisy guests on that day. I am happy to say that the hotel has no karaoke which is one of my criteria when choosing a hotel or b&b. We had dinner and, of course, breakfast in their restaurant. The food is good. The only flaw was in the morning when they served our breakfast late. We had made arrangements for breakfast at 8am. We passed through the back instead of the lobby so the front desk personnel didn't see us come down and inform the kitchen. Still, their restaurant staff never asked us what room we were from. At any rate the food arrived and the owner was very gracious and apologized to us personally. He admitted that it was a flaw in their system that they would fix. Very hands on, personal management. I highly recommend this b&b. We plan to come back here with our kids and tour the town. Now if what you're looking for is a resort and spa, this is not the place for you.

I heard that the food was good and wanted to try it out. Yes, they were right. The food is very good. Pricey but the servings are good for 2-3 people. The service though is another story. The place wasn't full and yet it was difficult to get the attention of the waiters. Worse, after they finally arrive and you tell them what you need, they completely forget about it. They didn't serve water until we asked for it. We asked for ice and it didn't arrive until we asked for it 3 times. When the food was served there were no plates and utensils on the table. And don't order their cocktails. It tasted like gasoline.I would have rated this restaurant much higher because the food is delicious. But you can't enjoy good food if the service is terrible.

Most tourists only go through this tunnel of shrine gates, but if you have the time, take the trails and walk through their bamboo forest and other paths. It is not crowded and for nature lovers, it will be enjoyable. Wear the right shoes though as these nature paths can be muddy and slippery.

Check in was relatively fast although you can get lost looking for the counter when coming from basement parking. The guards though are very efficient and courteous and will direct you where to go immediately. The place was pretty crowded as there was a company event, and yet it only took us a few minutes to get checked in.We stayed in the deluxe room. The room was spacious. The shower stall though is very small. Although there is a bath tub, you can't take a shower in it. I would not recommend this type of bathroom for big people as it was a tight fit getting in the stall and closing the door. I am petite, just 5 feet tall and 55 kilos. They also only provided us with one set of shampoo, conditioner. We called for an additional set but it was never delivered.They provide shuttle service to and from the restaurants and malls. Breakfast buffet was very good. Lot's of choices and the food was delicious.

You can see the chef preparing it as they have an open kitchen. Quite costly which is expected as it is a high end hotel. Their breakfast buffet had enough choices and they served fresh fruit, not the canned ones.

The staff are courteous and efficient. The concierge, Denise contacted me via email to address my concerns and answered all of my questions immediately. Excellent service from her end.The food in the hotel restaurant was very good and the bar complete. You have the option of going to Starbucks instead of the hotel restaurant too. They also provided packed lunches which we could order thru the seminar staff to save us time as our sessions were very tight.The room was spacious. They really have the best pillows, comfortable bedding and their toiletries were complete. I would have given it 5 stars except that on my last night (I only stayed 2 nights) the room was freezing as the temperature outside had begun to drop. I raised the temp to a comfortable 23 deg C but it didn't make a difference. I even raised it to the highest 32 deg C in desperation to get warm but it still didn't work. As it was 1 am and I didn't want the hassle of calling housekeeping and waiting for them to fix things, I just wore my thermal gloves and socks and covered myself with the blanket and comforter. Otherwise, it was a pleasant 2 days.

We got the weekend package for locals available til the end of the month. A standard room with a king size bed inclusive of breakfast buffet was P3000.  The room was a good size, very clean. It's a business hotel so don't expect a lot of amenities. The floor has no rug; just tiled but they do provide hotel slippers. 4 pillows which is great. Some business hotels only provide 2. Not much toiletries. Just shampoo, soap and tooth brushes with toothpaste. Very basic. Bring your own conditioner, lotion, shower cap, etc. There is a safe, a ref, a hairdryer and, FREE WIFI.Breakfast buffet was okay. Decent selection. There are restaurants in the area about 5 min walk. You have to cross a busy main road. Service is good. Very polite and accommodating.

The first thing you will see are the temple gates and all the stalls. Don't be discouraged by the stalls. If you are a traveler who includes local food as part of your adventure, then you will enjoy looking at the stalls and trying the different Japanese snacks. Unlike what you get in the grocery/convenience stores, these snacks are fresh and cooked right there in the stalls. You will notice that the Japanese don't eat the snacks while walking around as that is considered impolite. They stay at the side or in a few steps from the food stall until they finish their snack. There are also many stalls that sell all kinds of trinkets, souvenirs, scarves, etc. The temple is a quiet place. People buy ornate pieces of wood or tokens where they write their intentions, incense for praying, etc. There is a fountain where they wash their hands and mouth before praying. They don't allow pictures or videos to be taken in the prayer area.If you walk around the side streets you will see the rickshaw vendors who will take you on a personal tour around the temple. It only takes an hour to see the entire sight. You will spend more time looking at the stalls.

One gets to admire the masonry work of the 1800's. We were there in the winter and it was snowing so we didn't really get to see the grounds. I can only imagine how beautiful it would be in the spring. The artifacts are quite interesting but most of the descriptions are in Japanese.

A lot of open spaces, beautiful boardwalk and view. If you like shopping, there are many malls. There is an amusement park for children. The malls are connected via a walkway with a large open terrace in the middle. Be prepared to walk as the malls are not side by side like Shinjuku or Shibuya.

We had the Superior twin room. Bathroom amenities were complete except for the body lotion. It is not located in a convenient location. The train station is about 10 min away. Not too bad except that we had to pull our luggage all the way there. Shinjuku and Shibuya are not very close by.

Guests are provided a Japanese yukata robe and slippers which is to be worn in the hotel. We were served a full course Japanese dinner. My husband and I had a shiatsu massage which was very relaxing and hit all the right spots. The public bath and hot springs is an experience. Men and women are separated. If you are shy about bathing in public, you needn't worry. No one will stare at you as it is considered rude. You are only allowed to bring in a small hand towel which most women put on top of their heads while immersed in the pool. The indoor pools are huge. I tried the outdoor pools even if it was below 0 and still snowing. It was fantastic. since the pools are very hot, the freezing temperatures actually help you cool down.The flooring of the rooms are tatami and the bed is a Japanese futon. Very comfortable. The room can get quite warm but you can always leave the window slightly open. The en suite bathroom is modern and complete. If you don't want to go the public bath, you can just bathe in your room. It was a good experience and I wouldn't mind coming back again.

Spacious enough for 2 people. The bathroom amenities were very good but they didn't provide any body lotion. Very clean but they do need a new carpet. The hotel is well located. There is also a good ramen place nearby if you want a traditional Japanese evening snack. Breakfast buffet was complete. I loved the espresso machine.

As all the reviews state, the location is great. It is a block away from the Shinjuku station which is a major hub in the city. It is a maze!! It took several trials for us to find our way in and out of the station but once we got our bearings, it was pretty easy commuting all over Tokyo. Their mass transport system is highly efficient. Tip: Get a "passmo" card so that you can just load it and not buy tickets for every destination. The card also has no expiration date so even if you don't use up all the load, you can use it anytime you go back to Tokyo. Don't take a cab unless you miss the last train at midnight. It is soooo expensive.We stayed in a double economy room for 4 nights. It is small but since we were out from 10am to 11pm, it suited our needs. The bathroom is small and functional. Amenities are complete except for body lotion. The breakfast buffet was good. The hotel is very, very clean which is a major requirement that I always look for. And the wifi is fast!!The staff, speaks English well and are very approachable and helpful. You can always approach the information desk and they will provide you with maps, directions on taking the trains, etc. Take the airport shuttle so that you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for cab fare. The airports are an hour away. The shuttle will pass by the hotel.. Best to buy your ticket when you check in as it gets pretty full.All in all, it was a good stay and helped make our vacation enjoyable.

But getting to the the view deck is a struggle. They have built so many buildings for the stores that it covers whatever view you could see from the street before. Too many people, too little space to move around. Vendors everywhere.

Good beer, friendly staff, quaint restaurant, and good location. They have different kinds of beer. You can get a sampler of 6 for only P330. Their fruit beers (strawberry beer, kiwi beer and raspberry) were really good. Different, sweetish and not bitter at all. Their wheat beer is also okay but, of course, not in the same category as German beer. They also have a dark beer which I ordered in a glass (1 pint) which costs P170. The best place to sit is on the roof deck. Great view, windy and unpolluted (except for the cigarette smoke). Best to go at in late afternoon or at 6pm. The place gets packed after dinner, and since it is small place you may end up drinking on the steps.

For the adventurous, go for the superman, canopy and silver surfer. we did the package of superman, canopy and funicular. I wanted the silver surfer but it was unavailable. You have to wait a long time though especially when there are a lot of people. One ride can take as long as an hour in line. It will take at least half day to go through the package we went through. You can opt not to ride the canopy and funicular, but be prepared to walk. Walking isn't a bad choice as the trails are well kept and safe. Best to go in the morning and be the first in line. The packages will depend on what activities you choose. It ranges from P400 to P1000/person. The staff are friendly and efficient.

We are a family of 4 with 2 teenagers. There are 2 areas in the hotel, the newly renovated wing and the old one. My sister had the deluxe room with 2 queen beds and 1 extra. The room was very spacious and definitely more luxurious than the old wing. I chose the room with 4 bunk beds which was in the old wing. We actually liked this arrangement. Each bed space has a it's own cubbyhole with a socket to charge your mobile phone or computer, and a reading lamp. Very cozy and it makes you feel like you have your own private space. Perfect for a group of teenagers, for a group attending a conference, etc. There are enough cabinets for 4 people. No refrigerator though and you have to ask for a hairdryer. The wifi service is very strong.The bathroom is functional. Just a shower, no tub. The TV though should be bigger as there are 4 people sharing the room. There were also very many sockets in this room so there was no competition for charging our appliances. I liked the location of this room which is better than the deluxe of the new wing (front part of hotel). This room is located in the back, away from the street so we could keep the windows open and it was quiet all day and night. Since it was cold (12C), we didn't need to turn on the aircon and the room stayed comfortably cool, even on the top bunks. The hotel is very clean and well maintained. Although there was no safe in the room, nothing was stolen. The breakfast buffet had quite a small selection but the food was good. I would recommend though that they include more kinds of breads for the continental area. The hotel is well located for moving around the city by foot or by car. The traffic and parking though in Baguio is terrible so we would walk in the evenings instead. All in all, it is a good, clean hotel in the center of the city.

We were a group of 15 family members. From arrival to departure, 2 guides were assigned to take care of us and they were efficient, well trained, knowledgeable, courteous and always looking out for our safety. My mother and sister have knee problems, and all throughout the trip, they were assisted by the staff. The moment you arrive at the resort, a staff member in charge of activities works out your schedule. Your days will be packed with a lot of activities from snorkeling, diving, island hopping, sightseeing, lunch in their private islands, hiking, bird watching, etc. It all depends on what you want to do do. This is all included in the package so, be prepared because it is quite costly. Every meal is buffet style with a pretty good selection. Only the drinks are not included. We stayed in the garden cottages. The room is spacious enough to accommodate 3 people. Very clean, modern bathroom, complete toiletries. The pillows and bedding were very comfortable. Our only complaint was the catamaran (hobie). My husband and I both sail. Unfortunately, they only have one boat and it is apparent that they lack parts to replace those that get damaged and weakened by wear and tear. Despite the valiant efforts of their staff to repair the boat, management must realize that they must be provided extra parts to keep the boat in good sailing condition. Guests will be very disappointed when they find out that the boat is constantly under repair even when it is included in the list of activities. We really enjoyed our vacation and will not hesitate to return another time.

We arrived at 1am and there was someone waiting for us. He carried our luggage and immediately escorted us to our rooms. It is a basic hotel, only 4 floors with 15 rooms and no pool. We had 2 standard rooms with twin and king size bed on the 3rd floor. The rooms are large. The pillows were soft and the bed firm which is how is how we like it. The bathroom was very clean and had a complete set of toiletries, even more complete than the business hotels I have stayed in in Europe. Wifi was fast and consistent. The frontage is not that nice as it is located in a side street and our rooms did not have a view of the city. But it didn't matter to us as it was very safe. It is very near MBK, the National Stadium, BTS, and the Jim Thompson House. It is also near other shopping places like Siam Paragon. You can easily take any mode of transportation: water taxi, tuk tuk, taxi and skytrain. Very convenient. It is also quiet as it is not on the main road. Breakfast was good. We all liked the Thai congee. The restaurant serves good food at very reasonable prices. The staff was helpful. Not all of them could speak English well though. The managing director is Pui. When making reservations, it is best to deal directly with her. She is very accommodating and is fluent in English. We had no problems with the staff. I left my mobile phone in the room when we left in the morning. when we got back at 10pm, it was exactly where I left it even after the room had been cleaned. We enjoyed this hotel. Comfortable, clean and in the center of Bangkok. We will definitely stay here again.

Best seen with a guide who can explain the history and importance of each structure,as well as the cultural and religious significance. Very well preserved. It is a walk through centuries of tradition and culture. When we got to the Temple of the Emerald Buddha we were very lucky to see the ordination of a monk. It takes at least half a day to go through the entire place. Bring lots of water. Shorts are not allowed for both men and women. For women, long pants or skirts are required and no sleeveless tops. Preferably wear long skirts if you plan to use the same ticket to see the Throne Hall. Do not miss this heritage sight when you go to Bangkok.

What makes it interesting as well are the impressive artifacts and antiques JIm Thompson collected. The structure is made of teak and some of the doors are part of his collection as well.The shop sells beautiful handwoven products. You get to see how the silks are collected. It is a short tour, just 30 minutes.

It is not within the palace grounds and may be missed unless you are aware of it and include it in your tour. The building is of european design. Beautiful. You are not allowed though to take pictures of it even from the outside. Even our guide didn't know why. We were lucky though because it was graduation day and they allowed the graduates to have their pictures taken in front of the building. So we were able to take some shots.The inside is like walking into a European palace but the frescoes on the ceiling are all Thai. The building houses many works of Thai art, commemoration gifts to the king and queen. It is a testament to Thailand's culture and arts. The craftsmanship is so impressive, exquisitely detailed from the silk tapestries to the gold and silver palanquins and sculptures. I really enjoyed this place.

We are a family of 4 from the Philippines. We wanted a tour of the old city, to see the palace and temples in the area. We also wanted to move around via public transport so that we could get a feel of bangkok. It was a great experience. We moved around via taxi boat,bus, tuk tuk and cab. We were able to avoid the rush hour traffic and got to see many sites in one day- the palace, Wat Pho, the marble and teak house. We were lucky enough to see a monk being ordained. Joker explained the process to us. He also gave us not only historical facts but details about the customs, traditions, and the significance of each place which we would not have learned from a big tour group. Our teenage children enjoyed the tour and the experience. I highly recommend Joker to any english speaking tourist. Absolutely worth it.

Since we were taking my German nephews there, we joined the tour of Carlos Celdran. You can check his schedule and his style on the Google search engine. He is quite a character and will keep you entertained throughout the trip. His humor is witty and sarcastic. However, he is very blunt and will not cover up the atrocities during Spanish and American colonial years. Some foreigners may find him offensive.Be prepared to walk. Wear your most comfortable shoes and wear light clothing, Do not go during the monsoon season as the Manila area gets flooded and some areas become a lake during heavy downpour. Bring lots of water. This tour is not for small children. They will be very, very bored.

What they don't highlight before you spend your money to go into the park is any heavy rain / thunder then lightning they stop the rides, yes it is a safety risk and I understand that but when they don't have many thrilling rides which are inside and you have a teenager, then this is not the park for you. We had paid extra for a fast pass. I know you can't control the weather but you can control notices to inform people so they can pick a better day to visit, being given an umbrella from guest services is not the answer or go to the shows that was suggested as well!

The 5 towns were pretty amazing. Lots of free time to walk about and explore. However, the tour guide said nothing to us about these places.

They accommodated us with an early check-in and the concierge (GianPaulo) was great. He assisted us with many bookings and arranged a breakfast pack when we left really early for a day trip. Hotel breakfast egg options only included boiled eggs and scrambled eggs. You needed to pay extra for a fried egg. That's the only complaint. I would definitely stay here again!

Furniture is basic and is gloomy. The dinner buffets are good, but the breakfast is average. It would help if they bought other Christmas cd's as the one they had seemed to be on a loop every 30 min.

The concept of grilling your food at your table was really good. The buffet gave us a chance to try different traditional dishes - small amounts at a time. A really good way to sample a variety of meals.The highlight was the kulfi ice cream. Absolutely amazing. Do yourself a favour and try the paan flavour. Yummy.

The hotel staff dumped our clothes into bags and moved the bags between rooms.There is a lack of security around the astro turf area. I had an unfortunate incident when another parent assualted my 11 year old boy.On the seond last day, one of the staff cleaned out my room, taking my kids toys, my kids books and all the food in the fridge.

Pick up is at your hotel and then you meet your guide at the base and set off for Hilo and the volcanos picking up people along the way. The drive is long but broken up by a stop for lunch and a stop a rainbow falls if you are lucky. Our guide Justin tailors the tour a bit depending on the weather and we got a great deal of experiences from waterfalls to lava tubes, a great hike up to Makaophi Crater summit, 2700ft high and 5ishkmsAs well as seeing the volcano by day and night. This tour seems expensive but worth every dime. The traditional stories and facts about Hawaii's volcanic history, the different places you visit, the food, the comfy vans and of course the staff make it very special. Highly recommend this outfit.

We googled and rang a couple of places that were booked out then we came across Ball and Chain. They didn't require bookings and said if we had to wait they had a nice bar which is clever. We arrived, ordered a drink and waited less than 5 minutes (bar needed stools as it was standing only). Staff were lovely, but more importantly the steak & pork belly dishes were unreal. Being our last night of holidays we splurged on desert and well I can recommend the berry meringue & the cheesecake.

Rooms have been modernised but still look old, pool was too cold to enjoy, no spa either even though there is loads of room in the pool area. This hotel is over priced for the experience.

SharathMK|F75A970709FEA1371AA02E135DDBA804|Hotel|Bengaluru: Mango Mist Resorts|3| “OK Place”|review_493457419|We went there as a group of 22 members from our company, the place comes on the a few kms after the Bannerghatta national park, accessing the place was not too much of an issue.First Impression, the place was neat and clean so that's a thumbs up there (behold, it was only the first impression) ;) You have to take a token for everything, the token counters were restricted to only 2 places which made it quite irritating to go buy tokens for every activity. They didn't even accept money directly in any of the activity counters.Coming to the activitiesPaintball: We were a solid group of 14 members hence we split up into 2 teams of 7 members each, each of us paid INR 350 for 50 paint bullets (totally not worth it), the guns were in an ok condition but the gear was pretty pathetic, since i was XXL size i had a tough time finding a body suit for myself. The instructors were good and helped us around. Overall we did have a bit of fun trying to shoot each other silly. A few tweaks in the rules are required, instead of eliminating a person who gets shot, just give the team certain points and let the person continue playing till he finished his bullets that way everyone is still involved in the game and they don't feel ripped off after paying 350 and surviving only for 10 seconds. Fish Spa : This was my personal favourite, since it was my first time i didn't know what to expect, the experience was quite different and relaxing.Archery / Shooting : We had great fun here as a team, some of the instructors were good and taught us how to hold the bow where as some didn't do that. Never got around trying the other activities like Zorbing, Zip-line etc, but from the reviews i got from some of my friends who tried it, it was average, all the activities seem to be cramped up into one small space, the zip-line was too small especially if you compare it with the one in Shilandara.Food / Beverage : There were many issues with food and the location of the food area, variety was quite limited, there were 2 dishes for non-veg, the biryani and a chicken gravy , both were ok, instead i liked the fried gobi, also the curd rice was not cooked well at all and seemed like old rice. The service was good, no issues with that. The place again left us wanting, it was right next to a pretty contaminated lake with lot of debris, there were stray dogs moving about and creating quite a ruckus while we were having our lunch, though this place was covered with a fence it didn't help much with either the ambience or hygiene, suggestion would be to move the food area somewhere in the centre of the property. The Roti counter was pretty far away from the main dining area, many people infact didn't even realize that there was a roti / naan counter. Cocktail beverage was a ripoff again, totally not worth the money they were charging. All the cocktails were different flavours of Tropicana mixed with Vodka.Swimming pool was large, spacious and good. The shower rooms around the pool area were also good.Overall it was an average place to go have fun with friends. There is however a lot of scope for improvement, and i hope they do consider some of the suggestions.Pluses: Good Service, very good ambience in certain parts of the property, some of the activities (Fish Spa, Archery, Shooting)Minuses: Token system, food, location of food area, rules of paint ball.

SharathMK|F75A970709FEA1371AA02E135DDBA804|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|5| “Awesome experience”|review_478783077|Very well maintained and organised, the attractions were awesome, suggest you to wear light clothes (short and Tshirt are best) with a good walking shoes, wait time is too much (thanks to the overwhelming number of tourists on weekends), best avoid weekends and public holidays. As much as you may be tempted to take photos, keep that for the end, focus on finishing as many rides as possible it takes seconds for a queue to fill up and hours for it to clear up.Recommended rides > Transformers : Please please please do not miss this one, the experience is totally out of the world, though it is a short ride, it will leave you literally on the edge of your seats.> Madagascar : slow ride but totally worth it, the whole of the first Madagascar movie is recreated as an awesome exprience> Galactica : Not for the faint of heart, this ride provides great adrenaline rush, you will go all over the place even after you have stepped out of the ride :)> Jurassic World : It took us 1.5 hrs standing in the queue to finally sit on this ride, but the wait was worth it, especially once the rough part starts, great experience.> Far Far away (Shrek) : this is a good one as well, lord farquaad tries his best to torture you, its quite funny actually.> Revenge of the Mummy : i missed this one and i regret it, have heard great reviews of this one, but if you have a kid that doesn't match the required height then you will not be allowed, this is the reason we couldn't take this ride (though we could have taken turns, but it would have taken a lot of time)> Water World : slightly cheesy, but the actors put a lot of effort into this one which makes it really great, no special effects what so ever, hats off to the energy of these artists.Overall as i said, keep calm and complete all the rides first, it would do really good if you go early morning, the place opens at 10:00, so best be there by 9:30, get inside, take the first right and complete Transformers :) .. you surely wouldn't want to miss this one

Great rooms, very clean and well maintained, the flora and fauna inside the property was also very good, very friendly and polite staff. No wifi or any kind of connectivity, it is good to a certain extent but after sometime it gets anxious. Other than that the resort was soo good that we didn't feel the need to go outside the resort and experience Yercaud.

This is a very kid friendly place, it has a kid pool, kids play area, they also have another play area where there is PS4, air hockey, carom, billiards etc, we spent 2 nights there, the buffet breakfast was good, only thing missing was some desserts in the buffet breakfast. ;) The room was excellent and well maintained and so was the bathroom.Negatives:The only negative feedback i have is the choice of music, looks like they have only one playlist with 10-15 odd songs and this plays throughout the day, at times i felt it would be better if they didn't play any music.Also you need to be a bit careful with the bathroom door, there is a good chance that you might press the lock and come out, it happened to us, had to call maintenance to have them open the door.Overall its a great place to stay especially with family or friends, we had a great time and it is great value for money.

You need to enter Taipei 101 building in 4th floor and take elevator to 2nd floor then receptionists will approach you of which restaurants in 85th-86th floor you're going so they will guide you to lift you up. You will take elevator again to 60th floor then transfer to another elevator to 85th floor, then here you go! The place is perfect for a couple, family and friends. The ambiance, staff, food, view and service is great. But the price is very expensive. We spend 16k just for the dinner but it was worth it. Around 6:30 to 7:30pm, they have band that will serenade your evening.

The concierge asked me if I had a laptop in my bag and wanted me to sign a waiver releasing the hotel from any liability. This tells me they do not trust their staff, they do not want to be responsible for their staff, and they want me to absorb that responsibility. Does this Make me feel comfortable in leaving my belongings in the room???The positive encounter that I had was in the restaurant. The breakfast to your server Luis did a great job...

My experience is in the Philippines there's generally a lot of service but it's not great service. At the raging bull the service is great. My server was Mia however, it is a collective effort.

Arrived there at 10 am opening time just as the heavens opened. Thunder, lightening and torrential rain. All rides were suspended. Not good we thought. However, this turned out to be a blessing. When the rain stopped the place was mostly empty and we could go on every ride with no queue's which was great. Went from one ride to the next very quickly. I paid extra for the 'swimming with dolphins' for which I paid approximately 80 SGD. I think the price can vary dependant of the weather and how busy it is. It was a very pleasant experience with the highlight being pushed across the pool by two dolphins. The only downside was the fact spectators are not allowed which meant the only photos you can obtain are taken by an official photographer. They can only be bought from the park shop. I had to pay SGD 70 for two 10 by 8 photos which although very nice were rather expensive I think. All in all a very pleasant day if a little expensive.

The hotel is in a fantastic location at Clarke Quay if you want nightlife of bars, clubs, live music and restaurants. We had stayed at a different hotel in a much quieter location week or so before. So this was a very pleasant surprise. The hotel is rightly a four star and quite an imposing structure situated right on Clarke Quay. On first entering the hotel its colour scheme of mainly sky blue walls and white ceilings everywhere is quite hard to take in, although after a day or so you don't notice it as much. The hotel has a bar, pool bar, gym and quite a good size swimming pool with sun loungers. We had breakfast in the restaurant each morning. Quite a wide selection available buffet style which we enjoyed. The staff were always pleasant but clearly the biggest selling point to us was the great location of the hotel. Very close to the MRT Station which we used on most days. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Swissotel

At night time the area is well lit up and buzzing with people out for a great time. On our 4 night stay we ate out and had a few beers at various places. Prices are not cheap for drinks but most bars have happy hours or various deals. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and entertainment at Clarke Quay. A must go to place on a visit to Singapore.

The outside of the building is truly impressive especially the front entrance even though renovations are taking place. I hadn't realised how big the hotel is. Very nice chap on the door pointed us in the direction of the Billiards Room to obtain the famous Sling. A few people were there obviously doing the same as us. Two Singapore Slings and a Mocktail for the 13 year old. Nuts provided on the table. Whilst the Sling was very pleasant and service very nice it cost us in the region of 85 Sg dollars. Needless to say we just had the one as I would guess most people do. Another item ticked off the bucket list.

I am no spring chicken myself but 2 old dears were behind the bar. This is noticeable in Singapore that older people are employed which is great. However I don't think this would happen at a Hooters in say Miami. To be fair the service was good and various deals on drinks are offered ie buy two get a third free etc. All in all not quite up to the standard I would have expected.

You are taken on a guided tour of the area to see a small part of the 250km of tunnels used by the Vietnamese to evade American troops and bombs.there are a series of intricate, narrow tunnels which made it practically impossible for the US attacks. Apart from the Tunnels there are various booby traps which were extremely well hidden to inflict as much damage to the enemy as possible. You can also go to the firing range where you can fire live ammunition using various types of guns including an AK47. There is an opportunity to go into the Tunnels which were dark and cramped for the small Vietnamese. I am 6ft 2 and 100 Kgs. They were definitely not designed for anyone of my stature. I travelled about 100 metres and found it very claustrophobic. I couldn't wait to get out of there with two grazed knees and sweating profusely. I cannot imagine what it was like with heavy gunfire and bombs flying around. It must have been terrifying. If you wish to sample a bit of what it was like during the Vietnam War then this experience is must. You will not forget it quickly. Be prepared for a long day. It takes 2-3 hours from Saigon depending on the traffic.

Beware if you buy off one you can guarantee another 10 will suddenly appear. Good fun and we actually got good deals on t-shirts etc. Cheaper than the markets.

Plenty of places to eat including a 50's style American Diner. Film shows and parades. We spent the full day at Universal and there was just enough to keep us entertained. Prices vary depending where you obtain your tickets. You can expect to pay around 75 Sg Dollars on the day although we managed to get them for 60 beforehand. Shop around for the best price. There are other attractions on Sentosa Island but Universal is probably the most popular for tourists. Queue's for the ride's can be very long ( up to an hour) so get there early to get on the best one's. You can get a Fast Pass to all ride's for which you have to pay extra. Well worth a visit if you have children.

We booked Residence Club Deluxe rooms on the 11th floor. You have full use of the Club lounge on the 10th floor. Complimentary coffee, tea, cold drinks and a selection of nibbles are served throughout the day and evening. Complimentary Cocktails, Wine and Beers are available between 5 -7pm. Rooms are spacious and clean with a good size bathroom. There is a good size pool with numerous sunbeds. Also a gym. Breakfast is available in the Club rooms but a wider selection is in the restaurant on the ground floor. All the staff have been very helpful although some have very limited knowledge of English. This however is not a big problem. There is a park opposite the hotel to sit and watch the world go by. The traffic outside the hotel is something to behold. Horns tooting is the order of the day. Crossing the road is an event in itself. Don't dither just go for it is my advice. The hotel is in district 1. Nearby are Ben Thanh Market, Notre Dame Cathedral etc so plenty to see and do. Taxis and Motorcycle Taxis are readily available and very cheap. We have come to Vietnam from Dubai and Singapore. Everything here is so much cheaper than either. I love the hotel and Ho Chi Minh City. Its a great place to visit with many sights to see. Brilliant

Bus Stops and MRT conveniently situated within a couple of minute walking. Service in the hotel is very good especially the Concierge who has been very helpful today with a problem I needed to sort with the Airline we are using tomorrow. Breakfast room is very nice with a good choice of buffet. One small issue is because the hotel is so big ( 31 floors) there is usually a queue. Only once have we been able to eat inside. Most days we have had eat outside although that has not been a major problem. One day they set up extra breakfast facilities in the hotel bar. The good size swimming pool and gym are situated on the 4th floor. Plenty of sunbeds and complimentary towels. Complimentary iced water is brought to your sunbed from the pool bar very regularly and is much appreciated in the hot humidity. One down fall is the pool is in the shadow of the hotel until 12.30 ish each day. Sun worshippers need to be aware of this. Rooms are spacious and cleaned daily. Overall a very nice hotel which we have thoroughly enjoyed.
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Attractions|Dubai: The Dubai Mall|5| “Amazing”|review_475436599|A visit to the Dubai Mall is amazing. The carpark alone is the size of a small country. The Mall itself is enormous with every type of outlet you can think of. It is so big some people were chauffered around on a Mall Taxi. Never seen that before. Gucci, Swarovski, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Cartier and many more top brands which are beyond my pocket unfortunately. I can only window shop. There are fountains, aquariums, restaurants and much more. There is also a full size Ice-Hockey Stadium. The place is unbelievable the only problem I could envisage is it may be easy to lose the girlfriend and probably take a week to find her. Then again it could be an advantage lol. Go to the Dubai Mall and be ready to be amazed.
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Attractions|Dubai: Desert Safari Dubai|5| “Excellent ”|review_475434141|The Desert Safari is well worth a visit. You are driven across the sand dunes by a chap who thinks he is Lewis Hamilton. Plenty of screams from the ladies sat in the back as you are driven at speed up and down the dunes. On arrival at the venue you can ride a camel or a horse. Short rides are free. Longer rides on a camel are at a cost. There are also quad bikes at a cost of 50 UAED. I paid 20 UAED to hold a jolly big Falcon which was an experience.in side the venue you can enjoy barbecue food, fire-eaters and belly dancers. For an extra 50 UAED you can sit in VIP seating where the food is brought to you rather than queue up. Soft drinks are included but a pay bar is available for alcoholic beverages. The show lasts for 90 minutes and then Lewis Hamilton chappies drives you back across the dunes in complete darkness. More screams from the ladies in the back. Well worth doing this excursion on a visit to Dubai.
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Attractions|Dubai: Wild Wadi Waterpark|4| “Excellent”|review_475429601|Had a very good day at Wild Wadi. Some very good water rides which are thoroughly enjoyable for youngsters and grandad's alike aka yours truly. Plenty of changing rooms with lockers to keep valuables. Also quite a few eateries for burgers, pizzas etc. Good swimming area with a wave machine suitable for all ages. Prices are not cheap but also not too expensive. The best ride is the Jumeirah Splash which entails you standing in a tube at the top. Operator chappie counts down 3...2....whoosh you don't hear 1. The bottom opens up, you are gone and for what seems an eternity you have no idea where you are. Then you hit the water at about Mach 2 and your trunks end up around your head. Only joking about the last bit. An excellent ride for anyone completely mad. Wild Wadi is situated very close to Jumeirah Beach and Burj Al Arab hotels which you have superb views of from the top of some rides. We were a party of 6 adults and a 13 year old. I can honestly say every one of us enjoyed Wild Wadi. Well worth a day there
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Hotel|Dubai: Movenpick Hotel & Apartments Bur Dubai|4| “The right hotel in maybe the wrong place”|review_475427873|Good points - Very nice hotel. Staff very welcoming and helpful. Spotlessly clean. On arrival at reception we were given a room upgrade. Unfortunately there was no bed for Mast A although we had booked a room for 3. Called reception and this was sorted immediately with no fuss. Breakfast in the restaurant was good with a wide variety of choice and excellent service. A sports themed bar is on the first floor as well as an Indian restaurant. The 4th floor pool was a good size and also had a small bar. Again pool area staff excellent. Our room was very nice although with the extra bed a little cramped. Taxi's readily available outside the hotel doors. Also a Starbucks next to the main entrance................................................Bad points - the hotel is situated in the middle of nowhere. It used to be a thriving area but now due to building work elsewhere has very little to offer nearby.other than a few restaurants and very few shops which seemed to either be hairdressers or empty. One shopping mall nearby was closed due to repairs. Bar prices were excessive with a pint of Stella costing 52 UAED which equated to approx £11.50. To be fair a happy hour operated from 4pm until 7pm when prices are reduced by 25%. Overall we enjoyed staying at the hotel but there are far better areas of Dubai with more facilities within easy reach.
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Hotel|Emirates|5| “Super Emirates”|review_473345560|Flew with Emirates for the first time yesterday on the A380. I have travelled on all sorts of planes to many places around the world but I was very impressed with both the magnificent A380 and the service provided by the Emirates staff. Check in at Heathrow was fast with no queue whatsoever. The lady was very helpful indeed. I had checked in online 2 days before but could not get seats together for the 3 of us. Check in lady immediately sorted this as we had a 13 year old with us. Marvellous service. On entering the A380 I have to say I was gobsmacked. It truly is an impressive plane. It always astounds me how something that big can get off the ground. Seats were very comfortable with plenty of legroom. Its the first time I have flown economy class and not had my knees pressed up against the seat in front. The Cabin staff were very friendly and extremely efficient. The food on board was also of a very good standard. I would have loved to be able to see upstairs but my wallet doesn't stretch that far unfortunately. We will be flying on to Singapore on the 13 th and I must say I am looking forward to travelling with Emirates again
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Attractions|Florence: City Sightseeing Florence|5| “Beautiful Firenze”|review_415374810|We travelled to Florence on a day trip by high speed train. Travel time approximately 1hr 20 mins. The tickets were bought over the internet at a cost of just over a hundred Euro's for 2. Left Rome on 7.30 am and returned from Florence on the 5.30 pm. On arrival in Florence we immediately bought tickets for a bus sightseeing tour as time ws of the essence on a day trip. There were numerous stop points to get off and walk about. If you wanted to get back on the bus they came round every 15 mins. We probably did the bus tour 3 times during the day and got off at different points each time. Florence is a beautiful city with many interesting sights. On one stop above the city thr views are quite spectacular. We were told that the best T- Bone steaks are to be found in Florence and i must say i cannot disagree. We were so glad we visited Florence rather than revisiting places in Rome again. Well worth the trip
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Attractions|Vatican City: Citta del Vaticano|5| “Incredible Vatican City”|review_415368281|We visited the Vatican City on an organised tour that we pre-booked before leaving the UK. We had a tour guide and were armed with earphones to hear the information he provided in very good English although the sound failed a few times during the tour. We visited the Vatican Museums, Sistene Chapel and St Peters Basilica. First piece of advice wear good walking shoes as the tour takes about 2 and a half hours. The artwork, statues and sculptures are quite breathtaking and withe the help of the guide we were given all the information and history of each that we needed. If you try to get tickets on the day there are long queues. The temperature in August was around 30C so it is advisable to get the quick entry of the tours. After the tour we sat in St Peters Square taking in the atmosphere. You cannot visit Rome without doing this tour. On the Sunday we went early to the Square to attend the short service given by Papa Francesco as the Italians refer to Pope Francis. This again is not to be missed. Many thousands attend meaning it is difficult to get a good sight of whichever window the Pope chooses to use. Get there early, wear comfortable shoes and a hat is useful particularly in August. A memorable experience not to be missed.
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Attractions|easyJet|4| “Nearly a disaster”|review_413048870|Checked in at gatwick. Tried to use the automated machine to obtain boarding passes but it wouldnt work. Had to go to check customer services which only had 2 people working. Took a while to be served and was advised to go straight to check-in which we did. Tried to go through security gate. I was ok but girfriend couldnt. It would not accept boarding card. When we checked they both had same name and seat number. Had to return to check-in. Easyjet girl didnt even apologise. Sorted problem then had to run all the way to the gate which seemed to be miles away. Not a great start. Just about got flight. On board the plane seats were comfortable, food good, service good. Chief steward was excellant and very amusing with his announcements. Made the flight enjoyable. On the return flight evrything went a little more smoothly thank goodness. Apart from the initial problems we enjoyed the flights.
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Attractions|Rome: Pantheon|5| “Spectacular”|review_412766377|Anothe of Romes amazing sights. From the outside it looks as if it is on its last legs. Step inside and you feel overcome with the magnificent paintings and statues. It really is spectacular. You should not pass up the opportunity to visit the Pantheon. Entry is free as are most of Rome's Churches with only a few exceptions.
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Attractions|Rome: Trevi Fountain|5| “Fontana Di Trevi”|review_412470419|One word to describe the Fontana Di Trevi is amazing. We went back at least four time day and evening. Big crowds gather there purely because it is a wonderful sight to see. Truly beautiful to look at. If i had to pick favourite sites in Roma this would be very close to being number one.
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Attractions|Rome: Colosseum|5| “Spectacular”|review_412467774|Queued to obtain tickets and had to pass strict security measures which is a good thing. You stand inside and just imagine gladiators fighting each other or lions. Quite unbelievable that this was the norm in Roman times. Well worth the visit
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Hotel|Rome: B&B Beside The Vatican|5| “An absolute delight”|review_412464294|Upon arrival we thought the taxi had driven us to the wrong address. It looked nothing like a hotel or b&b. Turned out he was correct. Went to the 3rd floor to be met by Franz the owner. He offered us a drink and sat with us for an hour with a map telling us where everything was and how to get there. By the end of the hour we practically new everything there is to know about Roma. Usually you waste a day or so learning how to get around. With Franz's expertise we were immediately on the ball and raring to go. Franz and his good lady wife have been fantastic from the moment we arrived. We are really disappointed to be leaving tomorrow because we have had such a good time. The accommodation is 5-10 minutes walk from The Vatican which is probably the first priority for most visitors. You can book taxis if required from the B&B. Bus stops are nearby. We walked every day to the Vatican and caught the City Tour buses from nearby. The room we have had is spotlessly clean and has all facilities ie shower, wc, bidet, wardrobe, air-con and TV. We have loved every minute here and if and when we come back we will stay with Franz and his wife.
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Attractions|Patong: Patong Beach|3| “Great beach, very noisy nightlife”|review_361919991|This is my fourth visit to Thailand but first to Phuket. Although we enjoyed our week it has not been the overwhelming, great experience of the previous trips. I have visited Bangkok, Cha Am, Hua Hin and Pattaya plus various excursions. On my first visit to Thailand i was here for an hour and felt at home and absolutely adored the place. This time is a little different. I feel the people of Phuket are not quite as warm and friendly as other places. The Baht is king and they want yours. I will say as our week ended we did become to enjoy it more. The beach is big with beautiful views. Plenty of watersports available. Thousands of shops which seem to sell all the same products ie t-shirts, shorts, souvenirs etc. Many Restaurants of different nationalities with varying quality food. Massage parlours seem to be every other shop. A bit like Blackpool with Sun. The nightlife centres around Bangla Road consists mostly of pole dancing bars, sex shows, ladyboys and very loud music. You are pesteref every two steps by someone shoving ping-pong show cards under your nose. If that is your thing great but it becomes very tiresome. Of the seven nights we were there we only went to Bangla Road twice mainly due to the fact my girlfriend had never seen anything like it. The other nights we went to various other places and enjoyed it more. We went to some smaller establishments with live music or just for a meal. There are numerous excursions you can do but you must barter for the cheapest price. Do NOT pay brochure or leaflet price. We went to James Bond Island by Speedboat which included various swimming stops, canoe ride and lunch. The following day we went to the Tiger Zoo which also included an Elephant Ride plus a Monkey Show. Plus a zip wire, rafting and ATV ride. I believe Tigers are beautiful, fascinating animals but never in a million years did i think i would sit next to and touch one. One of the most exciting experiences of my life. One i will never forget. There are many other trips you can do. Plus on the excursions you also get to see much more of Phuket. If you like quiet resorts maybe Patong is not for you. There are many more resorts to stay. Would i return to Patong again? Maybe one day. There are so many places in the world to see and experience
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Hotel|Patong: Deevana Plaza Phuket Patong|3| “Room for improvement”|review_361912225|I was a little underwhelmed by the staff at check-in at the hotel. They were pleasant and efficient but this is my 4th visit to Thailand. A country that i love and i was expecting the wonderful enthusiasm of hotel staff i have received on previous visits. Room 328 was clean, spacious with a balcony overlooking the hotel next door. Small tip book a pool view room for a much nicer view. Bath room had both shower and bath. Water hot every day.TV was a good size but picture and sound not brilliant quality. Breakfast buffet had a good variety to cater for different tastes although sometimes cold. My favourite apparatus was the pancake making machine. Need to get one at home.The young lady who cleared up tables at breakast worked so hard with a wonderful smile and always gave a lovely sawadi ka. She deserves a big payrise. Also must mention security guards who were also excellent. The swimming pool is excellent with plenty of sunbeds and towels are provided. The only downside if you are a sun worshipper is that by early afternoon very few parts of the pool area get sun because it is surrounded on all four sides. A tip to the hotel is that sunbeds could be placed on the upstairs terrace with possibly a small pool. The hotel is 5 mins from the lovely beach and 10 mins from the nightlife of Bangla Road. Hard Rock Cafe and Hooters bar are opposite the hotel. There is an abundance of shops, eateries close by. Taxis are easily available but agree a price first. Bartering is the order of the day at all shops. After our underwhelming welcome, by the end of our 7 nights stay we did enjoy the hotel and Patong a lot more. We were quite disappointed to be leaving Thailand. If you book any Excursions from the many outlets available do not accept the prices on the printed leaflets. Again bartering is the order of the day. We did the James Bond trip which we enjoyed. We also visited the Tiger Zoo where you actually sit with and touch a Tiger. I have to say that is an experience i shall never forget.
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Hotel|Makati: City Garden Grand Hotel|4| “Super hotel in Makati”|review_358052198|Very nice hotel in Makati close to Landmark shopping mall. Bars and eating places nearby. Friendly reception staff who initially gave us a room on the 10th floor which had a view of a brick wall. We asked to be moved which was immediately sorted and we were given a room on the 26th floor with spectacular views of Makati. The pool is on the 32nd floor with a very nice bar. Very pleasant for sitting and watching the world go by below. The only downside is as i speak all the sunbeds are taken. Need to get here earlier as there are only 8 beds. Breakfast is included in our rate and is very nice. Plenty of choice for all nationalities.the sevice staff are very attentive and extremely pleasant. We have stayed in Makati before but find this hotel a big improvement on our previous one. The hotel is very clean with very pleasant modern decor. Obviously being in Makati roads surrounding the hotel are very busy 24/7 but we had no problem sleeping. No real complaints at all regarding this hotel. Would stay here again
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Attractions|Lindos: Acropolis of Lindos|5| “A very interesting experience”|review_312781414|We drove by car to Lindos. Upon arrival we were impressed by the mainly white buildings in the town, it is very picturesque. We parked the car easily. There was quite a steep 5 minute walk down the town square which was quite busy. There are numerous shops and restaurants selling a variety of goods. The passageways through the shops lead up towards the Acropolis which stands impressively on top of a hill. You can either walk up some steep steps or take a donkey ride for 5 euros each way. we decided to walk. The Acropolis itself is very impressive and there are plenty of opportunities for some nice photographs. it was a very pleasant day and very worthwile
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Hotel|Kolimbia: Lydia Maris Resort & Spa|5| “A superb hotel”|review_312777929|We arrived at the Lydia Maris after transferring from an absolutely awful hotel at fanes. We were nervous as to what we would find. On arrival we were greeted by the friendly face of the receptionist who seemed extremely pleasant. We arrived late at the hotel. We were asked if we had eaten and we replied no. The receptionist said the restaurant was closed but there was food waiting for us. After our experience at Fanes we could not believe the difference in the hotels. We felt we were in good hands and that the rest of our holiday would be more of a success. This indeed turned out to be the case. The staff couldn't be more helpful. The restaurant was excellent with a different theme each night. The restaurant was very clean and the staff excellent. The highlight was the superb cake stand. We have never eaten so many cakes. The chap serving drinks in the restaurant was extremely friendly and jovial. The pool bar also had very helpful staff. Unlike our previous hotel the drinks are certainly not watered down. Evening entertainment was put on each night which the children enjoyed. Daytime it was lovely to see so many people using the clean swimming pool. The pool was inspected by staff regularly each day. After our previous experience it was so pleasing to see people obviously enjoying themselves every day. There were various entertainments around the pool each day provided by enthusiastic staff. We could not actually find anything to complain about the Lydia Maris. We really did not want to leave at the end of our stay. I can thoroughly recommend this hotel
Jeremy F|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|Hotel|Fanes: Aegean Breeze Resort|1| “Hotel from Hell. The Medblue, Fanes”|review_307536985|We arrived at the Medblue, Kremasti on 19 August. On arrival we were told a disaster had happened which was not explained clearly by the extremely rude Reception chap. we were advised that we would have to transfer to the sister hotel Medblue, fanes. we were told to wait 15 minutes. 2 hours later we were still there. I suggested they provide us and the other families with taxis as transport did not seem forthcoming. We were told we would have to pay ourselves if we wanted taxis. Not a great start to the holiday. We were eventually transferred to Fanes. On arrival we were met Jerry on Reception who was quite helpful and welcoming. We thought things were looking up. As we were tired we went straight to our room and could not have foreseen the disaster that was awaiting us. The room we had was not good enough and we asked to be moved which the hotel eventually agreed to. We were in a rather large queue to complain about the room. We later discovered that there was a constant queue day and night with people of various nationalities waiting to complain about everything and anything. Lack of cleanliness, awful food, poo in one of the pools, hotel ran out of drinks ie beer, vodka etc on numerous occasions, watered down drinks, lack of sunbeds. There were so many things wrong it was unbelievable. I worked in holiday retail for 26 years and have stayed in all sorts of places and hotels. We were told the hotel was 5 STAR but I would struggle to give it 2 STARS. In fact that would be quite generous. We had to hire a car for 5 day to get away from the place as the hotel is very isolated with nothing but a couple of beach bars outside. We eat out because the food in the hotel was absolutely atrocious and could not face a bunfight with the Russians and Poles that the hotel seemed to cater for. This was all added expense that you do not expect when you book an All-Inclusive Holiday. we had a considerable cash outlay that we did not budget for. I have to say quite categorically this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I spent 5 days from the 23rd trying to get Thomas Cook Holidays to move us to another Hotel. We eventually ESCAPED the Medblue on the 27th. We were moved to the Lyda Maris Hotel in Kolympia which was superb from the moment we were greeted by the lady on Reception. Other people we had talked to at the Medblue were not as fortunate and stayed. I really don't know how they survived.

We hit this place during May 2016 and we timed our visit to a little before the local school holidays and therefore we did not have to wait long in queue for almost all the rides. A day is not enough if you intend to make full use of the place. If you are planning only a day visit, suggest you do a survey beforehand online and pinpoint the rides and shows you wish to go to. As you enter, if you go left, you start with Madagascar zone and if you go right, you start with Hollywood. Considering that we had a senior citizen and two kids with us, we had to be very, very selective. Out of the seven zones, we could spend time only on four zones and had to miss out on the other three. Most of the rides are fun but some are very intense so do proceed with caution. Almost all zones have restaurants so food is not a worry.

The paneer banjara gravy was a nice green masala gravy with the paneer being roasted in a tandoor and then added to the gravy. We also had the paneer tawa which was not very much to my taste. The roti was hot and soft. For the service, I would give a 4.5 on 5. The servers are very humble and accommodating.

Considering that the strength of catholic families are so less here, any repairs to be made needs financial assistance from generous donors. It is a small structure but so beautiful. It has a beautiful grotto of Mother Mary, inside the compound. The church has rooms which they let out to Catholics at a small price.

City is just 5 mins drive away from the resort. We visited during the Diwali holidays away from the Noise and Pollution and this time it was only for relaxation and not for any sightseeing. No disturbance and you are left by yourself unless you ask for help of any sort. Smiling service at all times, be it the ground staff, room staff or the restaurant staff. Check in and Checkout were quick and easy. We liked the room given to us, a family of 4 (2 Adults + 2 kids), on the first floor. It had a double bed + a single bed + a loft which too had a double bed. so the room was spacious. It does not have a kitchenette but the staff will provide you with a microwave if you desire. A la carte and buffet both were served at the same restaurant. Buffet meals were not very expensive. Rs. 900+ taxes for an Adult and Rs. 430 + taxes for a child --- this is for a package of breakfast and one meal i.e. either lunch or dinner. Dinner is always preferable as the spread is more varied at that time.

However, make sure you reach this place before 11am as they then finish their stock of fresh strawberries. This dish comes with a good two scoops of ice cream i.e. Vanilla and Strawberry icecream, with a generous dose of cream. For a price of Rs. 150/- this is a real steal.

It has a restaurant which serves only Veg snacks though slightly overpriced. Most importantly, it is very clean, separate counter for water with used/unused glasses kept separate on either side of a filter. Counters and tables too are clean. For Snacks they have Sandwiches (Rs. 126 for half a sandwich which they call a mini with a few fries and Rs. 216 for a full sandwich which they call classic, again with a few fries). They use bread which they bake in-house which is not your normal size bread. A single slice covers your palm and still spills over so you can imagine the sandwich too to be quite big. They also serve Veg Pizza's which range from 399 to 599 which are enough for 2 people. They also have a Soup in their Menu and French Fries. For Dessert, they have Chocolate Walnut Fudge (Rs. 199), Thick Shakes for Rs. 180, Mocktails for Rs. 79. Strawberry with Cream, their signature dish, made from Strawberries which are grown in house are for Rs. 210/- However, ensure to reach there before 11am to get this dessert item. Sizzling Hot Chocolate Brownie (Rs. 240) too is on the menu. Ice Cream Scoops are for Rs. 129 which is taken in Waffle Cones will cost Rs. 30 extra. Mapro has a secondary restaurant which is not very populated as it is a little away from the entrance. Mapro allows you to view their bread baking and chocolate making process from outside through a glass wall. They offer a tasting of all their products.All Mapro products are offered at a discount of approx 10% i.e. their chocolates, crush, jam etc. This discount does not apply for the restaurant.

This restaurant was referred by a colleague who praised the place to the hilt and man, he was so right. Satkar serves great seafood thalis. Common in all seafood thalis were Solkadi, Chapati, Fish fry, fish curry with one piece fish, Rice and green chutney. We ordered Prawns thali, surmai thali, halwa thali and tisrya thali and a couple of plates of bombil fry (my way of measuring the tastefulness of a restaurant). a couple of us exchanged our chapati for Rice Roti and some of them with Wade. the Rice Roti was nice and soft. Wade were piping hot and tasty. Fried fish piece was sizably big. Fish Curry had half a piece of a big fish but was sliced very thin. The Tisrya and Prawns too were tasty. Bombil is one of my favorites and it is my personal opinion that the restaurants that serve fresh bombil fry usually caters to tasty seafood. I am known to have walked out of restaurants that do not serve fresh bombil as that is one fish which is not very expensive but if not sourced right, it can taste awful. this is after I experienced horrible food served after having eaten a stale bombil fry. As I repeat, this is my personal opinion.Needless to say in this case, the fish was fresh. I however am a curry person so the curry fell short when I had to eat the rice roti and the rice with it. Also, no finger bowls, only wash basins. The place is clean with attentive waiters. a little congested but otherwise great. Parking is difficult here what with a Rickshaw stand right outside. There are 2 icecream parlours right next door to round up your lovely meal :). Expense wise, we were 5 of us and the bill came to approx Rs. 280 per person.

The view of the snow capped mountains is so very lovely. This journey for tourists is best made on the local vehicles though rickety, the drivers who are locals know their way through the Pass (anyways, Non Himachal Pradesh bearing vehicles are banned on Manali-Rohtang highway). The road is slippery due to the ice and the road snaking around the mountains is best known to them. Be aware, as you go higher up the pass, breathing for some becomes a little difficult. You need to rent the snow clothes to go to the Snow Point. check the rates at a few shops before you rent as there is a tendency by the vendors to quote astronomical prices. Do not go to vendors directly referred by your driver. Gloves are usually not added to the set so suggest if you can ask for them, especially for kids. We learnt it the tough way. My young one was enjoying the snow thoroughly, after a point where his hands went numb and he was terrified. He went back inside the vehicle and refused to come out. As a result, we had to cut short our stay. Make sure children are wearing thermal wear or layered clothes. Best if you carry a set of thick socks and change them once the children are through playing in the snow as the snow tends to creep into the gum boots and wet the feet. Best if you start early in the morning. We visited this place on 31st August 2013 and were we lucky!! It had started snowing just as we reached the Snow Point. Though a short trip, it was just wonderful.

The fort is surrounded by a moat and can be reached only through a wooden drawbridge. The entrance had small hidden gaps in walls from where arrows could be shot without exposing the archer. These holes in wall were also used to pour hot oil if anybody dared to climb.Diwan-e-aam pillars were built in such a way that the emperor could see all over without obstruction.

Sorry to say I was not so very impressed with the food. It was very average. The Biryani was fine but not over the mark. I possibly missed the Biryani made by the person a generation or two back. Egg Prata was ok. Mutton Liver too was fine. I would have however appreciated a better combination of spices for the Mutton Liver. Biryani was not the dum biryani variety but where rice and chicken curry are prepared separately and then mixed while serving. The stall is messy/dirty and so is the seating place outside. We can lower our expectation considering that it is a small stall but it is the method/taste that matters.The people serving at the stall needs to adjust their attitude. They maintain that they serve the best biryani but it is the overall experience that forms in the minds of the customer and this customer aint satisfied :(

We tasted the Biryani, Prata and the curry. they were good but the attitude of the people at the stall needs a little working on. we also tried the biryani at another stall and found them to be equally good. Pricewise most of the dishes at any of the stalls are in the range of SGD 4-7 so not very expensive. Each serving can satisfy one person's huge appetite or can be share by 2 if they are not very hungry.We also tried the Hainanese roasted chicken rice. I liked the roasted chicken but I am not used to bland rice and I think the lady who packed our food missed to add the spicy sauce. this dish costs SGD 4.

Both the bird shows are very interactive and informative. each show is for 20-30 mins. An absolute must for kids and for a nature/bird lover. For a relaxed visit, keep aside at least 3-4 hours.

The two domes are very impressive. one is a flower dome which had an amazing display of tulips among other flowers. The second dome was the Cloud Forest which was like a mountain with a huge waterfall. It displayed the plants which you would find on mountains. Most impressive was the Children's Garden which my son enjoyed it to the fullest with the water sprinklers, slides and numerous games. We also tasted the satay's at Satays by the Bay which were quite tasty. Unfortunately, we were not there for a longer duration and could not enjoy the place to the fullest.

Staff were cordial and helpful. But I was very much floored with the locals who work there. they ALWAYS HAVE A SMILE ON THEIR FACE which really helps when a traveler visits an alien country. Rooms are very clean but of course for the regular wear and tear. it is a big hotel with 19 floors. We stayed on the 15th floor. The rooms are spacious. When I had read the reviews of many hotels, I was a bit apprehensive as many of the hotels had very small rooms. But Village Hotel at Bugis did not have this issue. Also, the rooms would be cleaned and toiletries replaced everyday. They provide a hair dryer, coffee/tea maker with supplements replaced everyday and an iron. Breakfast is served on the 5th floor. It has a swimming pool on the 5th floor. The breakfast spread is quite elaborate with 3 three types of menu - local, Indian and continental. Wifi is free. The hotel is at a walking distance of 2 minutes from the Bugis MRT. Good eateries close by. It has a 7-Eleven shop opposite to the entrance. A 24 hour supermarket round the corner on North Bridge Road. The Church (Church of our Lady of Lourdes) across the street. Bugis shopping (Bugis Street/Bugis Junction) is at a walking distance. I would recommend a stay at this hotel.

We had Veg Grill Sandwich, Dahi Puri and Mango Milkshake. Food quality, I would say, very good. Mango milk shake was awesome. Price, a tad costlier than other joints. Dahi Puri - the puri was oval shaped, something different and looked very tasty but for someone like me who does not like curd this will be difficult to review but my hubby found it good, more like the Punjabi style of Dahi Puri. Service can be improved a little. the wait staff takes a little time to attend to the customers. We had to ask for water twice before one of the wait staff could serve us water. not that there seemed to be a shortage of wait staff as there were plenty of them just moving about but at a very leisurely pace. I would definitely like to come again, this time with my family for a leisurely dinner.

Ambience --- very so,so. Attitude - very arrogant, which would be justified if the experience was excellent but in this case, not justified at all. Food - we ordered Afghani tandoori chicken, The Mutton Taka Tak platter, Mutton Salli Boti (Full), Dum Ka Murg (Half) and Roti. For Dessert, Firny. Afghani Tandoori chicken was very dry and obviously made much earlier so not fresh and juicy at all. Roti too did not seem freshly made. Mutton dishes were tasty. A full main dish is enough for 4 people and half dish for 2 people. Firny comes in a small plastic cup enough for one person. We went on a Friday evening. Table booking is not allowed, so you need to go and wait. All in all, I would say -- a one time visit only, and do ignore the arrogance if you want to enjoy your meal. avoid the tandoori items. mutton dishes are much better than chicken. My verdict - I was not so very impressed.

I got to know about this from Zomato as I was searching for a good place that sold Waffles. He opens only after 8.30pm and is placed on Salunke Vihar Road, opposite Fat Cat's Cafe. We have so far tasted the waffles with toppings such as Dark Belgian Chocolate Mousse, Strawberry compote, Blueberry compote and Bananas with caramel. I personally preferred the belgian Chocolate Mousse topping. The Strawberry and Blueberry compote was too sweet for my taste and I would have preferred the bananas if they were caramelized which they were not. Cons: Henny's opens up anytime after 8.30pm. Too much waiting time (can go from 30 mins to an hour of waiting time). Worst of all, too many stray dogs around the truck. I, for one, am pretty scared of dogs and stray dogs are worse. It was only the smell of the waffles that wafted towards me that kept me waiting. You can take a parcel but I would not recommend it as the waffles go soggy by the time you reach home and the toppings get all messed up.

It serves a limited menu of Seafood especially in a 'Thali' form. In a thali, they serve 2 chapatis, rice, fish curry (with a small piece of mackerel irrespective of which thali you take), green coconut chutney, solkadi and a fried piece of fish of your choice. In addition, they also serve Chicken Thali. they do have a very small 'a la carte' menu of fried fish and masala fish. This restaurant is just trying to find its footing in this business so food is extremely fresh but on the negative side, menu gets exhausted very soon. When we visited, the masala menu was over and only the fried menu was available. We ordered Surmai thali, prawns thali and chicken thali. The curry and masala chicken in the thali was spicy to my daughters taste (since I relished the spicy taste, I more or less polished it off). We were however very impressed with the Surmai thali. The Fried piece in the thali served to my husband was huge. The piece that was served to me however was of the stomach side which I was not at all happy to get but the restaurant replaced it when I asked them to change. Ambience -- a little congested with not much elbow room. It however is bright and more importantly, Clean. Service - one server running about the place. he is the order taken, the server and the cashier so you can imagine how harried he would be. Food - The owners wife herself cooks the food so you can expect good taste and personal attention. The prawns however were a little undercooked to our taste. The chicken masala served to my daughter had a neck piece and a joint piece whereas she usually prefers meat pieces. We met the owner and let him know our feedback and he was open to suggestions. Price -- not too expensive. Surmai thali was for Rs. 220 and prawns for Rs. 240. I would like to visit this place again more for the taste and quality of food.

I had been to the Amanora branch twice before but wanted to check out if the other locations gave the same experience. Pros: Food has the same quality except for the prawns which we found too bland for our taste. Ambience somewhat the same. Since we had booked a table, we did not have a long wait. Valet Parking was a big plus. Cons: Service, I did not find the service as quick or as proactive as I found at Amanora. The tables were short of plates for the main course, short of spoons for dessert and we had to ask for it twice before we were provided with the same. The seating place is kind of divided. as you enter, there are seats to the left and to the right. We were seated on the left side and there was a live salad counter on the right which we were not aware of nor it was mentioned to us. We noticed it when we went looking for the Kulfi counter. A suggestion to BBQ Nation would be to check with the guest if they are first timers and if they are, then guide them accordingly. All in all, we did not get the feel of being to BBQ Nation (kids included), a place which we otherwise immensely enjoy.

For a new comer to know --- it is a good Udipi restaurant but has only snacks. Parking - a big problem especially for four wheelers. Very easy to find and is known to almost everyone in Pune. Waiting time for a large group is very long. For 2 to 4 people it is not much, maybe 5-10 mins if you are not choosy about where you want to sit. Vaishali has seating space within the restaurant and in their garden area. Many prefer to sit in the garden area and therefore the waiting time is too long. if you dont mind sitting inside the restaurant then the waiting time is not much. as far as food is concerned, I could not find fault with the South Indian items, the masala dosas are crispy with the masala simply being yumm.... Idli wada sambar too taste very good. Bhel items --- have always loved the taste of their Sev Batata Puri ( I dont relish curds so that is one ingredient that I dont add in my SPDP) but the puris over time have degraded in quality. they are at times burnt and tough to chew --- not crispy as they are supposed to be. The taste of the chutney is still the same so the burnt and tough puri notwithstanding, I still relish the SPP without the 'D' :)Tea maybe not an item which anyone reviews over but I have liked the Tea that Vaishali serves. Service is prompt --- the waiters have to rush as the place is always very crowded at all times of the day so do not expect the waiters to give you leisurely time to order. Cost - high but that is expected from a restaurant which is a landmark. All in all, a good place.

Voice carries here as it is a small place and the lights are kept very dim, so dim that I had trouble reading the menu card. The burger tasted good, fries were crispy. though mentioned as hot and spicy, for my taste, it was not that spicy. I for one like the chicken in burgers as steak pieces and not mince so I did enjoy the burger. not very expensive but not very cheap either.
indianfoodlover2015|3A90DE07A1CA6B516407BE380580C486|Restaurant|Pune: Konkan Express|5| “awesome, lip smacking food”|review_308817814|visited this place once again in August 2015. possibly the time was right but whatever it may be, the food was simply tasty and awesome. we ordered the crab thali, shimpli thali and prawn thali. the sea food was very fresh and we relished it so much that we polished it all off. in fact, one of us requested the chapatis to be replaced with 'wade' which was piping hot and tasty. The thali is too filling for one person and the curry provided though looks little but is more than enough. Will highly recommend this place to anyone who loves Maharashtrian seafood. in fact, as I am writing this review, my mouth has started watering and mind has started making plans for the next visit :).

Initially in fried rice, we used to get good quantity of chicken in it and the gravy was tasty. Now the gravy is more water and cornflour. Burnt garlic fried rice barely had any garlic taste in it. we asked for well cooked Tandoori chicken and were given slightly charred chicken. since it was home delivery, it could have been chicken that was cooked way before and then just reheated (chicken was very dry). Lasa's is covered under foodpanda.com and offers discounts to a max limit of Rs. 150/-.

indianfoodlover2015|3A90DE07A1CA6B516407BE380580C486|Restaurant|Pune: Barbeque Nation|4| “Lip smacking food and awesome service.”|review_283772538|we visited BN at Amanora. Beautiful ambience and awesome service. the servers are very courteous and polite. They make every person visiting very special. I appreciate this especially because they do it without any intention to get anything out of you. if you have visited BN anytime you will know that TIPS ARE NOT ALLOWED. Food --- Starters are yummy and they keep coming till you are full. Fish, Prawns, chicken, seekh kabab, chicken drumstick, paneer, mix veg, soya, mushroom - they all were tasty. however after a particular point you feel that the marinade for all seems to be the same except for a few items. Main course too was lovely. Even though I was full from the starters, I had to taste each part of the main course. Since I am purely Non Veg, I headed off in that direction. from the salads, I especially relished the Peanut salad. the bhel taste to it was simply awesome. Main course --- Chicken biryani, fish in hunan sauce, mutton gravy, chicken gravy, egg curry all were tasty. I especially enjoyed the egg curry. Kaleji and gurda dry was good. Manchurian soup was good. Drinks - we were served unlimited rooh afza and one complimentary drink which included beer as well. Dessert -- Icecream in 2 flavours, chocolate cake, brownie, phirni, shahi tukda were great. Kheer was served as it was the Ramadaan period but the taste was not upto the mark. The kulfi counter was the best part. 6 types of kulfi with topping of your choice was lovely. We also celebrated my sister in law's birthday with a cake courtesy BN at no additional cost. The servers all gathered together to sing 'Happy Birthday'.Saturday meal for one costs you Rs. 575/- inclusive of taxes. though it seems to be expensive when you actually think of it, it turns out very reasonable. try calculating the same amount of food consumed at any good restaurant on ala carte prices. i would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone open for suggestions. If you are planning on going here for dinner, and open air is an option then try to get a table in the balcony which has a view of the water fountains.

But the one dish that you MUST TRY at this place is the 'Hollige' also known as 'puranpoli' in marathi and if you have the time, do take some time to see how the cook makes it as he makes it in front of all. it is a technique which I am not sure any of us can master. he so beautifully makes this totally round with just a sweep of his hand (and I mean this literally). the hollige totally melts in your mouth. just writing this review has made my mouth water.....
indianfoodlover2015|3A90DE07A1CA6B516407BE380580C486|Hotel|Bengaluru: Ashraya International Hotel|4| “Centrally located but average hotel”|review_281987596|we stayed at Ashraya in May 2015. we had asked for a triple occupancy room and got the corner room on 1st floor. Room was pretty huge and decent layout. very central location and we considered it as pretty safe as the Commissioner's office was bang opposite the hotel :). Jokes apart, the hotel is at a central location (Vidhan Soudha is at a walkable distance). however the hotel road is pretty deserted in the evenings with not much activity. there is however a road parellel to the hotel road (cunningham road) with a mall and your usual restaurants etc. The hotel itself has a good restaurant attached to it and a couple of restaurants next to it. I can however recommend a very nice restaurant a couple of buildings away from this hotel - Nisarga Veg restaurant. do give it a try. Breakfast was complimentary with your usual paratha/idli/dosa/bread/eggs. please ask for fresh stuff while you sit for breakfast as the breakfast on buffet has been prepared for some time and it does tend to lose its texture and taste if kept out for a long time. this is a good place for business travellers. For people travelling with family, do check for a location which is more active --- my two cents here :)

The palace, like in all palaces, is huge, beautiful exterior and interior and has a lovely collection of artifacts. this one is well maintained. reasonable entry fee. On display is the darbar area, gifts received by the Maharaja, photographs and paintings, glass work etc. You are not allowed to touch or go very close to any of them. you are not allowed to click photographs at all. there is a separate wing which is the residential wing. separate entrance and fees are collected for entry to this wing. it has the clothes worn by the royal family, the palanquins used by the Maharanis, their family photographs etc on display here. the place is clean especially in view of the fact that you have to deposit your footwear outside the palace. they do have a place allocated for depositing your shoes which you can collect on your way out and yes, though mentioned as 'free' the caretaker does tend to ask for 'bakshish' (a token for having taken care of your footwear).

Zoo is clean, well maintained and the cage or animal holdings too are clean and well kept. A must visit if you enjoy animal like and absolutely must if you have kids with you. However, do take into consideration that this is a huge place and a very long walk. they do have battery operated vehicles if you dont want to walk this long distance.

indianfoodlover2015|3A90DE07A1CA6B516407BE380580C486|Hotel|Mysuru (Mysore): Hotel Jade Garden|2| “An Ok experience”|review_279649830|Location: Very central. easy accessibility. very quiet with not much traffic noise. Convenience: There are restaurants, convenience store close by at walkable distance. Rickshaws are easy to find (but beware as they charge astronomical prices. Ricks dont ply by meter and for the closest of distances, they charge Rs. 40). Checkin/Checkout is quick. The Hotel has a pretty decent foyer. Rooms are decent in size. Bathroom definitely needs to be in much better shape than what it was. Shower curtains, I tried my best to avoid actually touching it. the toilets used to stink possibly due to some drainage issues. we had to ask the Housekeeping to spray some room freshener every time. The best part was the view from the room. The room that we were given on the second floor had a building very and I mean very close to the hotel window. if we open the curtains, we can actually look straight into the other building's window. so you can understand my paranoia about keeping the window curtains closed at all times. The hotel has a restaurant (Curry Leaf Restaurant) attached, which I found pretty decent and reasonable too. Buffet breakfast which was complimentary had a pretty good spread (though more or less the same every day), served at this restaurant itself. They provide room service and the food was good. I particularly liked the Chinese. Service however leaves a lot to be desired at the restaurant. You have only one person available to assist everyone at the buffet counter during breakfast for taking your orders, refilling the empty containers, tea/coffee refill or bring fresh etc. I would not blame him if there is a delay as there is only so much one person can do. Service at the hotel was good. Housekeeping would clean regularly, refresh toiletries Just next to the hotel is a travel agent who has a tie up with the hotel (Hotel Airlines building) who can help you with your travels. My suggestion: if you want a place only to spend time in the evening with easy accessibility to all sight seeing places and reasonable + decent food, then this hotel can be considered, albeit with a little compromises.

Enjoyed the experience. it is a very clean place and colourful. it has huge statues of Buddha. Though to enjoy the experience, it is said that you should burn an incense stick inside the temple, sit on a carpet and feel spirituality but frankly speaking, that is quite not possible when you have kids with you. however, i did feel a sense of calm inside the temple. if you are visiting alone or with your partner, you might want to visit this place at leisure and spend some time in silence. the interiors of the temple are very beautiful.

After reaching, you need to take a boat to cross a shallow river (Ticket price approx. Rs. 30 per person). Then take a ticket to enter the camp (approx. Rs. 30 per person). You can feed the elephant here (Feed cost Rs. 20 per feed). Feed consists of grains wrapped with hay. The elephants are led into the banks of the river where guests are allowed to bathe them at a charge. The visitor gets an opportunity to come close to the elephants who are well trained and it is also safe for kids to be close to them. There is however the nuisance of stray dogs in the vicinity.

Each of the 1BRs have a balcony that open into nature which you can truly enjoy with a cup of tea. Rooms are large in size. these rooms have a kitchen with a Microwave oven, toaster and sandwich maker and the usual cutleries. Very clean. there are activities each day. coincidentally, they had a kids party when we visited (about 2 weeks back) with magic show, games, snacks et al. My kids enjoyed it.the rooms are at a distance from main area but there are vehicles that take you to and fro if booked in advance. we also experienced pre-monsoon showers and the resort provided umbrellas which was very thoughtful. The resort has an in house shop which offers items such as honey, bread, butter, cold drink, mineral water etc. on mrp rates. they also sell sarees and dress materials at reasonable rates. the resort is away from the city as it usually is. however, there are auto rickshaws that ply on those roads. also, club m offers transport facility. In addition, right opposite the resort is a travel agent who can help you with cabs for city to and fro plus sightseeing. however the quality of the cabs and service is much better @ Club M albeit a tad expensive. a definite visit again.

Pork Chilly was good. My kids enjoyed the thai crunchy chicken, I however found it to be too oily. Fried Rice --- they offer a large portion so do check before you order. 1 Fried Rice is enough for 2 people. I would suggest other guests visiting this place, telling the waiter when you visit, to ask the chef to go easy on the oil.

I have been going to this parlor for more than 5 years now and a visit to Mangalore is not complete without a visit to Ideals. we visited Ideals about 2 weeks back. just so that we can gorge on the ice creams we went there during lunch time and started with a sandwich and then went berserk ordering the ice creams. we ordered our usual favorites ---- gadbad, parfait, dilkush. we also ordered cake ice cream but found the cake to be very dry. we had tasted American choconut on one of our previous visit. it is a slab of vanilla icecream loaded with roasted dry fruits. that too was great.

The location is good as it is in the heart of the city with good restaurants close by. the hotel itself has some good restaurants. Our room came with complimentary buffet breakfast and the spread was lavish. Room size was decent enough as all hotel rooms are. however, suggest if you confirm your booking before you land here. when we visited the hotel was overbooked and for a triple occupancy they could manage only a room with 2 single beds which they had to then club and give us a mattress. also we overheard a guest having booked in advance and was told there was no room for him. he however managed to convince the hotel to give him a room.

The best that I like at this place is their Thali. they are reasonably priced at approx Rs. 250 and consists of a sumptuous but limited meal. They offer rassa, fish with rassa, chapatis, fish fry, papad and rice. our menu is usually set when we go to Konkan Express. we order Bombil fry for starters, solkadhi and sweet lime soda with it. For main course, surmai thali and prawns thali. when this is done there is absolutely no place for dessert. My husband has to round it up with a magai paan to digest this lovely meal. Pomfret we usually avoid as once when we tasted it, it was not fresh. did not try it again. The ambience is very basic but comfortable. it is usually full during the weekends and you may have to wait for a little while to get a table. This itself proves that the restaurant is worth going to.

The rooms were large and clean, and the bathroom was new and also had a bathtub. However, the floor had a carpet that was not comfortable to walk on barefoot, and the beds reminded me of dorm beds! Breakfast was decent - limited spread but the cakes were wonderful. The surrounding area is quiet and nice place to walk around.

The staff were attentive to our needs and many were eager to chat up a conversation, offering advice and taking feedback. It's they who make the experience very memorable. And the breakfast, this is truly the best hotel breakfast we've had. The highlights were the pastries and the specialty coffees. We do hope to return here the next time we are in Bali.

So, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the menu at White Sands had a few vegetarian options. We went around sunset and most tables were full. I had Jaffles while my wife had grilled fish with rice and most played with his French fries. He finished the tomato ketchup though! The food was OK but I'll recommend the place for the gorgeous view of the bay and the sunset.

So, finally my organization gave free tickets for employees and subsidized tickets for family members, we decided to go. I was wrong on both my initial assumptions. We decided to cover USS clockwise so we avoided the crowds and queues. And there were numerous rides and sights that we (and our 2 year old son) enjoyed, namely the boat ride at Madagascar, the 4D ride at Shrek, Transformers and especially Waterworld.

But considering our son just turned 2 and is becoming a 'little unmanageable', I thought 'why not go somewhere nearby without all the hassle of travelling?' So, we opted to spend 2 days in Sentosa and settled on Le Meridien. It was a good experience. The hotel is clean and the room was comfortable. Our son really enjoyed the bathtub and swimming pool. breakfast was good, but not exceptional. The hotel is situated conveniently near a few attractions, namely the Sentosa Merlion, Siloso Beach and iFly. There are numerous dining options too. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel for a short stay of 2-3 days.

What an amazing sight! It's impossible to describe the beauty of the gardens. A lot of effort has been placed to create and maintain these gardens and the results are wonderful. We spent a good 7 hours exploring each area of the garden and though there was a large crowd when we started our visit, the crowd began to thin after 5pm. So, we also had the benefit of exploring some sections just by ourselves. It's truly worth spending a whole day, and even multiple visits. If we visit The Netherlands again in spring, we'll certainly return to Keukenhof.

It's a well-run family hotel that is located near Bacharach's centre. They maintain a very nice garden and surrounding houses are very pleasant. They offer an excellent breakfast that came with the best coffee we had during our trip. Furthermore, the family running the hotel are very helpful and attentive to our needs. On our 2nd day, after we returned to the hotel, my 1 1/2 year old son started vomiting. We approached the hotel and since the doctor in Bacharach had already left for the day, Daniela quickly called several places and found a hospital in Bingen that is open and that will attend to children, and also booked a taxi for us. Her timely help made all the difference. Thank you

It was if we were transported back by 200 years. The halls, rooms, staircase, corridors all contributed to this feeling. The staff were informative and helpful, particularly the gentlemen who attended to us upon check-in. Furthermore, the location is just minutes away from the Markt. The breakfast was served in a beautiful room with a gorgeous chandelier. And adjoining the hotel building was a beautiful garden. My 1 1/2 year old son really enjoyed the breakfast and playing in the garden!

Since it's a business hotel and there were no major events when we visited, we managed to get a good deal. The room was spacious and very pleasant. My 1 1/2 year old son really enjoyed playing on the very comfortable bed ;-) As for nearby amenities, there was a subway (Schumann) and train station (Bruxelles-Schumann) within 10 mins walk. There were also several good restaurants, a patisserie, 2 convenience stores (Carrefour and Louise Delhaize) and a pharmacy. We truly enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning.

We were welcomed by very friendly and attentive staff. What we first noticed was that the restaurant had an amazing ambience. Their wine collection was displayed artistically on the walls, with a circular pillar stacked with wine bottles all the way to the high ceiling! We started off a Cream of Porchini and Cream of Pumpkin - both were excellent. This was followed by the main course of Penne with Genovese Pesto Sauce where the highlight was the sauce that brought out the full flavour of the dish; and Grilled Sea Bass with Sicilian Sauce. Again it was the sauce that made all the difference. Then we had a surprise birthday treat by the staff who sang a birthday song for my wife and brought a complimentary apple crumble with ice-cream. That was very touching for my wife who is not usually used to attention. I had a Panna Cotta with fruits which was definitely the best I ever had. The taste stayed in my mouth long after I left the restaurant.It was a truly memorable visit, with great food and service. We'll definitely be back.

We stayed here for 4 days and it was a truly enjoyable and relaxing experience. The views of paddy fields and Mount Agung were magnificent. And Nyoman, his wife Wayan, and the staff were both friendly and provided excellent service. This is an excellent place to chill out for a few days as it's pretty remote and offers no distractions - this is the only resort in the area, and it's surrounded by village houses. There are no major attractions, restaurants or shops within walking distance, no TV in the room and there's Wi-fi only in the reception area. So, it provided the rest and relaxation we were looking for.It's also good base to explore the paddy fields of Sidemen and Iseh, climb Mount Agung, visit Besakih, and go rafting at Telagawajah.

That said, I didn't have much expectations while going there. But it was a pleasant surprise. The staff spoken reasonably good english, the resort was clean, the rooms were a bit spartan and old though. But on the plus side, we had an excellent snorkeling trip organized by the resort; and the best of all, we had very good food. Even the vegetarians had enough options at each meal. Overall, we had an excellent trip and our students had a fabulous time.

But curiousity got the better of me and we decided to walk on the bridge. And it was a good decision, somewhere near the middle of the bridge, you get excellent views of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour. I got some of my best pictures here. One thing to note: The winds are strong, so don't wear hats!

It is historic hotel with friendly staff and clean rooms. But the things that stands out is the location, which is very convenient for transportation (in between Wynnard and Town Hall Train stations, countless buses on the next street i.e.George St); food (Subway McDs, food courts); and even the attractions. On our first day, we walked the Botanic Gardens, then to the Circular Quay and then we walked back!

The immediately noticeable feature about this hotel are the staff, especially the counter staff. They are very helpful, offer good (and opinionated ;-) advice, and make the necessary bookings as required. One good example was the deciding on the Blue Mountain Day Tour. If not for their advice, we would have chosen a more packed and tiring option. With their advice, we had an excellent day out!

It is just so amazingly beautiful with the Opera House, Harbour Bridge and the Circulr Quay. Whichever angle you look at it from, it's scenic. My only grouse here is regarding the food options - either you have pricey restaurants or reasonably priced unhealthy food ;-)

The apartments are located at the edge of Chinatown and are less than 100m away from the nerest bus stop. So travelling within the city is very convenient. The apartments thenselves were brand new with all the required items and utensils. It's a great choice for those who like to cook.However our stay was marred by poor service at the reception. We wanted to extend our stay for another 3 days and told the reception staff and we were told that the room would be booked. But about 2 hours later, we received a call from another staff stating that no booking was made and we need to pay much higher rates now. So, we moved out. I expected better service from a place rated so highly.

Not far from the Royal Palace, this place serves great Khmer and Thai food at affordable prices. And excellent seating too (upstairs). First time I tried raw crab -average, and amuk (fish) - excellent! The deserts were excellent too, especially the mango with sticky (glutinous) rice.

I spent over 2 hours going over every single exhibit. There are a lot of statues from Khmer period and other items from later periods. it's just amazing how much of our ancient practices, architecture and sculpture have traveled so far from India and developed a unique from in Khmer. It was cool to see Sivalings similar to those in India. It was even cooler to see statues of Vishnu, Shiva, Ganesha, Durga and Karhikeya with local features. Vishnu looked more like an Egyptian king ;-) And there were numerous other items like drums, conch shells, plates, prayer items which are very simialr to those in use in the present day. Truly a rewarding experience.

We needed an affordable hotel that could house all 20 of us so we chose Starwood. The hotel is located in a side lane off Sihanouk Boulevard, a busy main road 15 mins tuk tuk ride southwest of the main tourist attractions (Royal Palace, National Museum) The rooms were clean and very affordable at USD 18 for a double en-suite but some rooms (on Level 2) faced assault from mosquitoes! Furthermore, the hotel did not have a restaurant. So, if we are hungry at night, we needed to trek at least 10 minutes to the nearest 24-hr minimart. Also breakfast wasn't provided so finding a place to eat in the morning proved difficult as most of the eateries offered only local and Chinese food. There were few tourist geared facilities in the area. Next time, we'll probably stay closer to the action!

It was extremely busy on a Friday night and you have to line up to order your food. There was only one person taking the orders and the line was really long. It took forever.The food came out pretty quickly but it was average. The pork belly was chewy and cold and the ribs lacked flavour. The food is also overpriced for pub grub.A good pub to socialise but that's about it.

We arrived at 7pm on a Friday night, the check-in was easy. The room was clean and had a romance package set up ready for us (wine & cheese in the fridge, chocolates and rose petals on the bed.) The sunken bath was lovely and relaxing and overall the room was well kept.The breakfast is probably one of the best breakfasts I've had at a hotel in a nice open dining area looking out at the pool. It also lasts from 7am until 11am which is later than most hotels.What I like most about this hotel is how central it is. You can walk across to Roche Estate where there are bars and food, or go to the Hunter Valley Gardens next door or stroll to Harrigans Irish Pub.I would definitely like to stay here again.

It's location is stunning, it's hard to imagine they used such a beautiful spot as a convict camp.It's definitely worth strolling around and learning about the site.The only downside was the free 40min walking tour. We had limited time so decided that we'd use this tour as the best way to find out the most in a short period of time. However it was less of a walking tour and more of a standing tour. We literally stood for the first 20min of the tour in the one spot and listened to the guide talk. I think it would have been much more effective if we walked and talked. As a result we didn't get to explore the site as much and felt we'd wasted time.

Creamy, delicious. Spot on.Entrees were crispy pork belly= heaven. And a lobster pate with hot crusty fresh bread *drools*For mains we got sirloins with mushroom gravy and they rub the skin of the steak with this coffee rub and, whilst it sounds weird, it just worked!Every single bite of every dish was a 10/10.This was also a birthday dinner so it made it even more special to go somewhere that aced everything.

It is in such a picturesque part of town, lined by old buildings, giving you that real European feel. We were there right on opening and grabbed one of the best sausage hot dogs I have ever tasted in my life. We washed it down with some delicious vanilla milkshakes from a different stall and then waddled up the markets and bought ourselves some nice woollen beanies. A great start to the weekend, such a lovely and vibrant atmosphere. Well worth a visit!

My partner and I sat at the bar downing wine and beer for an entire night chatting to the patrons, bar staff and listening to the live music. We also got peckish around 10:30pm and discovered that they have a take-away menu that we ordered chips and gravy from and someone cooks it down the road and delivers it to you right in the pub. The best thing for a drunken night!We didn't use the restaurant but I looked at the menu and if I were to go back I'd give it a try because the pub grub looked very appealing.

Well, maybe not the chips- they're just thick cut chips, but the FISH! I ordered beer battered flathead and it was crispy and salty on the outside and the flesh of the fish was creamy and melts in your mouth. Yummy! HUGE serving sizes as well. My partner ordered the fish burger and he was also happy with his pick.Good spot, we ordered to eat in and sat at one of the outside tables in the sunshine watching the sea and washing it all down with a crisp pale ale.

My, my my!! I felt very spoilt as I settled myself into my plush lounge with cushions and was immediately brought over a glass of sparkling. They also serve wonderful canapes that vary depending on what time of day you're in the Posh Pit. In the morning we received a collection of tarts and quiches and in the afternoon it was a tasty platter of dessert delights!The staff are friendly, the boat ride itself is quick (30min) and smooth.A great experience!

We went when it wasn't snowing and got to see the rocky mountain terrain which was just as picturesque. It provides great views of Hobart and surrounds and has little tableau's of information to give some historical context.A great spot for a decent selfie, too!Make sure to rug up because even on blue skied, sunny days the wind can provide a chill factor.

The options at the bar are fine, the front of the pub is ideal for watching sport and they often have a big screen in the beer garden with games playing.I was terribly impressed by the menu and would probably only recommend the burgers, which were quite good.I would rate this place as ideal if you just want to watch a game and drink a beer.

We had steamed pork & leak dumplings which were to die for. Followed by chicken and rice and Japanese katsu udon. Washed down with freshly squeezed mango and pineapple juices.The food here is amazing and everything costs between $3-10. Definitely worth a visit.

We got ramen and kway teow noodles and the food was delicious. It's always nice to watch your food get made in front of you. Prices were around $6-8 per dish and you can score some pretty cheap beers here too.No air-con so prepare to sweat whilst eating but it's all part of the Singapore experience!

They just ushered us straight in.We ordered fried rice, egg prawns and of course, the 1kg chilli crab. They warned us that the food may be a 45 min wait but it came out really fast.The food was delicious but it was pretty expensive. All up- 3 beers, small dish of prawns, small fried rice and the chilli crab cost us around $200.But it's well worth eating the Singapore signature dish by the seaside at least once :-)
Tori S|81F2CFAC94822F1E3466B702C3354B61|Attractions|Singapore: Orchard Road|3| “Overrated”|review_478365606|Meh. Unless you are a millionaire and actually plan on spending your fortunes in these stores than it is pretty boring. Sure it is glitzy and glamorous but window shopping items with price tags at a minimum of $10k is only entertaining for 20 minutes before you feel a stiff urge to start drinking. Definitely take a stroll but don't plan your whole day around it.

There's nothing too special about it. I think it's just the novelty that you can buy perfume, clothes, food and watches all in one go at the one location.It was interesting to walk around and have a look but it isn't going to blow your mind.

Grabbing lunch here was the perfect way to end a day spent at Universal Studios.It was really busy but for some reason there weren't any queues to line up for food. It all just flowed along nicely. I had Kway Teow (which is a delicious noodle dish) and my partner had a lovely wanton noodle soup.Prices were cheap too! Both dishes were decent in size and only cost $8
Tori S|81F2CFAC94822F1E3466B702C3354B61|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|4| “Express is the best!”|review_478363593|Look out for cheap tickets online and make sure you pay extra to get the express pass.Get there early (as in, before it opens) because queues to enter the park start forming really early.We were at the front so when the gates opened we were first in line for the rides. My tip would be to only use the express pass if the wait for a ride is 10+minutes. Otherwise just line up and use the express pass later in the day when you want to go on the ride for a second time. That's what we did and it meant that we got to go on every ride twice without lining up.My second tip is to make sure you do the Cyclon rollercoaster first (it's the most extreme ride in the park) because the lines are huge later in the day. Even if you have the express pass it is still a 45min wait.Drink plenty of water as some of the lines get really hot and don't wear loose shoes because they make you take them off for some of the rides.

We stopped in for dinner and had satay chicken, lemon chicken and these awesome rolls that you dip in custard. All washed down with some (reasonably priced!) Tiger beers.It's medium price (if you want super cheap then go to the Hawkers Centre.)Well worth a visit just for the experience of wandering around.

The Long Bar is closed for renovations so we were seated in the Billiard Room. It's a lovely old place with all of the original finishing.The first thing I noticed was how the floor was COVERED in peanut shells. I was just delighted- it doesn't get much more authentic than sitting at a bar shelling peanuts.The Singapore Sling itself was tasty but prepare yourself for the bill as they are $37 each!!Well worth the visit for the heck of doing it- definitely a novelty.
Tori S|81F2CFAC94822F1E3466B702C3354B61|Attractions|Singapore: CE LA VI Club Lounge|3| “Good views”|review_478358475|We came here after watching the light show in the Gardens. You pay $20 and receive a $20 voucher that gets you up to this bar and then you use the voucher towards your drinks. The bar location has great views, it's nice to see the pool too, but the bar itself is pretty small and the cocktails are very expensive. The margarita I ordered was SO potent. It was so alcoholic and poorly mixed that I couldn't finish it, which is a shame considering the price. Don't get me wrong, I can handle strongly mixed cocktails, but this one wasn't mixed well at all and it was not pleasant to drink.I feel like this bar is a great novelty to come up, have a drink and see the views. But it wouldn't be my top pick overall. Like I said, more of a novelty bar.

Everything is tall, beautiful, lush and amazing. Walk to the centre, sit down on the ground and lean back and look up!We went there for the free 7:45pm light show. It runs for 15minutes and every second of it was impressive. It was a definite highlight of my trip. I felt like I was on a different planet and I was nearly moved to tears by the music and timed light displays. A trip to Singapore would not be complete without a visit to the light show in these gardens.

It was easy to get to, fairly central to everything (but taxis are cheap anyway so it doesn't matter.) The rooms were a decent size, well air-conditioned and always clean. There is also free WiFi which is a must in this day and age.I found the hotel staff really friendly and helpful. The check-in and check-out process was very quick and easy. The buffet breakfast is marvelous with heaps of options.It should also be mentioned that the hotel bar does some pretty good 2 for 1 happy hours. I would definitely stay here again.

But alas, to not share this beautiful place with the world would be a crime. Sure it's swanky- it has a bar, cinema and spa's and an infinity bath that I had to extract myself from after successfully turning myself into a prune. But the great rooftop views, plush beds and luxury feel of this place is not what makes it great. What TRULY makes your trip amazing are the hosts- enter Rob & Ian. As soon as my partner & I met them we felt we'd known them for years. When we drove away on our last day we looked back at them waving in our rear view and my partner turned to me and said "I feel like I'm leaving the in-laws."Rob & Ian are so warm & make you feel instantly comfortable. They are the perfect balance between being social and also leaving you alone to explore and unwind.Stay here. You'll come away feeling like you've added two new members to your extended family.

So surprising!We had a 5-course dishes and the food was so good! We really like the salad in the beginning which the Chef used Asian white mushroom as part of the dish. The Chef actually delivered the dishes to our table for few times and explained the idea and concept of the dishes in details. The Chef actually invited us inside of the kitchen and gave us a mini tour.

The lines for the rides are quite structured. And they set up normal line, express line and single rider line (to fill up empty seats). The new transformer ride (indoor; 4D) is fun! Must try!

We had a plate of fresh fruits which was arranged just like a piece of art masterpiece. Then, we got the ham, the meat, the cheese, the dry fruits, the fresh bread, the coffee and the pastry... Oh Carmen and Joan, you really set the bar too high for breakfast now! Service: Carmen and Joan were just great and too friendly!!! We did zero research prior the trip...Carmen and Joan actually planned and arranged our day trip to Douro Valley (private tour to two vineyards for Port wine tasting), made reservations for the best restaurants in town (lunch AND dinner) and offered us Port Wine whenever we come back to the room! Thank you Joan for your dinner arrangement on our last night! We were literally dine with the sunset right next to us on the beach. Amazing!

We took photos on the rooftop around 6-7PM. No one was there so we can enjoy OUR TIME. Overall, SATISFYING EXPERIENCE!Only for RM130s when we booked online on traveloka.

I never came here with my Malaysian friends, yet.But I will never come here for the "air suam". As in some places, a small glass of it would be charged for RM0.20. But there is another place even worse, RM0.50/glass, and it is not even a restaurant.Once more:Bakso Bihun, Satay, Nasi Goreng, Gearbox (soup). That's what we usually came here for.

WiFi: was having a problem.”|review_471471600|The location is very strategic. There is a mall, petrol station, eateries, etc.We were there for two separate nights. A friend gave us that chance, thanks to him. It was a room in 6th floor (if I'm not mistaken), the window is facing the parking area of Aeon Bukit Indah and Petronas station. There is a tv, small fridge, safe-deposit box, kettle, etc. We don't know whether all of those things are available in all the rooms or not. Because you know, we didn't book it.There is a password for the WiFi on the same card for the breakfast record, we connected to the WiFi successfully but there was no internet access. Useless, maybe there was a problem with their internet facility at that time.

Order nothing and pay RM15 entrance fee, OR order cheaper-than-RM15-food/beverages.”|review_471175687|The place is classy, good, nice, tidy, and clean. Unfortunately... we came for the cats but CAN'T HUG/CARRY them, yet we still CAN PET them. If you come but order nothing, you have to pay RM15/person as the entrance fee (it is to help them to "maintain the cats and cafe facilities at its best condition" as they've said). That's why we all chose the cheaper than RM15 foods/beverages, so we don't have to pay RM15 but got no food/beverages. If we muslims want to pray then we have to go to the nearest Masjid (Masjid Kolam Ayer).

But we don't know the schedule, sometimes there is no show at night when we came or passed through this area.We usually see people gathered here, whether for some sports or just hang out maybe.And when we were circling on this park, we see that this place looks like an "abandoned place" in some spots.

Three times staying in KL, All of it was here!”|review_470931609|It is cheap. The cheapest we found, compared to other places. We stayed at the bedroom with Air Conditioning (5pm-9am if I'm not mistaken). Shared bathroom. Price before GST (April 2015) was RM 30 or 32 / night. After GST it became RM38/night (last time was January 2016). But now I see the price for A/C Room with shared bathroom is RM56.Last time was January 2016, I just reviewed it now because I just have the chance and remembered. But I still remember it well. So unwillingly I have to choose "April 2016" for the "When did you travel?" question. If TripAdvisor is going to remove this review, okay I can't say anything but "You said you want us to review places, I still remember it well and I am sure about it, so please consider to keep this review".

Allowed half a day for the water park followed by a day at the Legoland park itself - a good amount of time to see everything. Was definitely worth the visit. Had a lot of fun. We stayed in the Premium pirate themed room which overlooked the park and was just as pictured on the website. The disco lifts with music and lights were a novel touch. Hotel foyer was full of activities for the kids (it was a little crazy at times but all manageable and lovely to see so many active, happy kids). Our daughter is aged 7 and I felt it was perfect for that age group.

Both times we have purchased Unlimited Express Passes. We visited mid week and found it not to be too busy, however if you're a thrill seeker and want to hit the more popular rides more than once then I would recommend spending that bit extra on the Express Pass to skip the queues.

We needed to spend another night near airport and this hotel was listed. When we got here the checkin was smooth. We asked for a room on the highest floor. There is only 3 floors. But there is also no lifts. So if you have a lot of luggage your going to have a hard job getting them all up the stairs so ask for a room on the ground floor. There is a person here who helps with the luggage. The room itself is ok. Basic. You have a shower and toilet in the bathroom and the wash basin is out on the balcony!! Strange one that. There's everything you need in the rooms so you can't complain plus it was only about £80 for the night. So you get what you pay for I suppose. Breakfast was hardly any choice. So that was disappointing.

If your British stick with channel 33. Plenty of movies every day.. hotel breakfast Was nice and fresh. Really tasty coffee out of the machine. The hotel is a 20min walk from Chinatown and the Clarke Quay bars and restaurants. Just up the road there's a huge shopping mall aswell. I'd recommend this place.

They do a kava ceremony to invite you into their family. The Kava is like dirty water and as no taste but it does numb your tongue for a few seconds. But if your in Fiji you need to try it. You then go over to the mud pool where your cover from head to foot in mud. You wait for about 15mins for the mud to dry. You then wash it off in the mud pool. After that you go into the thermal pool which is as hot as a bath. If your sun burnt it does sting a bit. After your cleaned off you go for a full body massage. They women use real coconut oil. It's amazing after. There is cold drinks and fruit included. Worth the experience

Darling harbour as a sea life, wildlife on the docks. There's a maritime museum across the bridge with a huge warship in the water outside. There's plenty of shopping and food courts. And just up the road theres the Chinese Garden. It's definitely a place you should visit. The hop on hop off bus also stops there.

Waking up to the sunrise over Sydney harbour was a picturesque view. Amazing. The room it self is very spacious with 3 large windows. Check In was smooth and fast. The Buffett breakfast as everything you need to set yourself for the busy day ahead. Great hotel with a great location.

It lasted just over 2 hours. But well worth it. The guide Robert was brilliant. He explained everything we needed to know. We got up close with kangaroos and koalas. The zoo itself is well layed out and there's so much to see.

There was a slight problem but that was our own fault. Our flight with British Airways landed 5.20 in the morning but we was unable to check in until 11. The receptionist took our cases and said we can use the spar/pool or pay to have a breakfast. We went out into the city instead to look around. It was early but it was quiet and we took the sites in and enjoyed our stay. We stayed in Room 1920 with balcony. It's nice and high and great view. Amazing shower, also desperate bath. Comfy bed. With coffee and kettle. The buffet breakfast was the best breakfast I've ever had in a hotel. Everything you could imagine was there. Even a honeycomb for fresh honey. Pancake maker, the lot. I will be back here to stay.

Sydney buses showed us everything we needed to see from the opera house to Bondi beach. The driver gives you head phones and when you take your seat you can plug your headphones choose your language and it will tell you everything you need to know about certain parts of the city as your driving past. You can have a 24 hour pass or 48hour. Good idea if your in a rush to see everything.

The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. We had to print our boarding passes out for our next day and the staff was more than happy to help. We had a few drinks and food in the restaurant. The chairs are not the comfiest but they are not to bad. We paid for 2 tiger beer, 2 meals and a can of sprite 100 RM which is about £40 gbp. The food was nice. Breakfast in the morning was good aswell. It's a buffet breakfast with plenty to choose from, I couldn't get around having chicken curry and rice next to beans on toast. We would stay again.

The place is just amazing. So much history. You can walk all the around the stadium. There's a tunnel there and shows a lot of history from before I was born. The Munich clock and plaque on the walls is sad to look at. The mega store is huge and so much you can buy in there. Trust me it's worth a visit even if your not a Man Utd fan.

The cenotes was a great experience. They are sink holes with fresh water. The was is amazing to swim in and the bats flying around in the cave is great to watch. From there we went to the beach to swim with Sea turtles. That's something on my bucket list that's now been ticked off. The beach itself is one of the best beaches I've ever walked on. Mexico should be very proud of their beaches. After the excursion Sebastian took us to have some traditional Mexican food.. Highly recommend

It was a bit of a disappointment as there isn't much there. The good thing is if you go there while on a cruise you can use your sea pass from the boat and all your drinks are free just as if you was on the ship. I took advantage of that to be honest. But the place itself is beautiful.

It's right on the beach and some amazing views from our balcony. It's only a short walk to shops and bars. The breakfast buffet was lovely and a reasonable price. I will recommend this hotel if you are staying in Miami. I will be back in the future.

Nice size TV on the wall of the living room and bedroom. We went over to the bar/bistro for food and a pint of Carling is £3.50 which is a good price and the food was really nice and reasonably priced. But the portions are big. I'm drove down from South Wales and the staff at the bar was really welcoming, saying welcome to Cornwall as I ordered a drink and food. Great place to bring children of all ages.

When we arrived at the island we could see all the Dolphin swimming in the sea. I liked the look of it straight away as the Dolphins was in their natural habitat. As we walked towards the shops etc we could see sea lions and manatees swimming as well. Swimming with the Dolphins is an amazing experience. There's so much to do here, you won't get bored. The boat ride back to cancun is perfect timing for the sunset. Amazing!!!

Great night with lots of people around, Music was oldies. The only problem is the price of drinks there. Not sure if the locals get discounts, but once you bought a bottle or two you only get so many mixers with each bottle, so if you want to add on a mixer it will cost you about RM60.00. Crazy money for the poor! Lots of bars outside that looked happening which i will try next time. Guys ensure you wear long pants and proper shoes, sandals and short pants will be denied entry.

It did not let me down, and for the price was pretty good. This place does not serve duck but the chicken and pork was really tasteful. If you like chicken rice then you should try here. Try to get there between 10.30 - 11am after the breakfast and before the lunch rush hour. Watching the TV about the chefs story was quite good too. SG$3.80 for chicken rice, SG$10.00 for 3 types of pork meat.

Yes the wings was spicy, I took the level 4 Lancaster wings and I really can take spicy food, but these actually burnt your lips and was the only reason this place got 2 stars instead of a 1 star! Also order the BBQ ribs and this was like the worse ribs ever, how can people say the food here is nice. meat was not tender, just over cooked, tough, and no taste, had to leave the ribs behind. One pint of Stella was SG16.00. I would recommend everyone to stay away from here!

You must come here and try the following: Mushroom Pepper Fry (SG$6.00), Mango Curry (SG$5.00), Chicken Tikka Masala (SG$13.00) and the Garlic Naan (SG$3.00) was to die for. I really wish I was back in Singapore eating here right now! Keep up the good work. Service could be a bit faster though!

You can get cheaper tickets from Travel agents and not at the park itself. The unlimited access pass to all rides is an extra sg$80 per person or for a 1 time access pass to each ride is sg$50.00. Great place for kids and even adults. A Lot to do to keep you entertained for hours. Transformers 4d show was really good and good to go in although everyone runs to the roller coasters first up so I worked my way round clockwise and pretty much had no queuing time for anything until the roller coasters. Jurassic park opens at 11am so enough time to get there. Food was pretty bad inside the park so eat a full breakfast before going although you can get stamped out and eat outside and then come in again. If you get an mrt there is a free train ride to the main entrance!

Lots of routes to go walking so wear proper attire. This place is used by lots of locals for exercise and the lake in the middle is used by lots of youngsters doing sailing. The smallest trail is 3km per way so it should take no longer than 2hours to complete back and fourth. The bridge is around 4km from the start but its closed on mondays. You could spend a lot longer here and I would return here for running when I return to Singapore.

Pie was tasty but need to serve better mash potato. Drinks were flowing all night long, reasonably priced but the shots are very expensive. 10 shots at rm350. At that price took the bill well over a grand with the food and drinks we had.Staff were nice although the boss didn't want to give me the hat, I got 1 from the staff and had a real good night.

I got a special rate through booking.com but the Hotel said was not valid and the price was more, complained but to no avail! Checked in, room seemed a little light with not all the room amenities which were usually provided. Breakfast was just a Crazy scene. Day 2 morning. Got given a table, put my bag down, went to get some food, come back and the table was given to someone else. I had to wait around whilst looking for another table. I skipped the breakfast the next morning and went local, thought I'd give a go the day after, almost the same thing happened. I got a table, put my bag down, went to get some food, then whilat Keeping an eye out this time the waitress come over to my table took my cutlery and passed it to another table leaving me empty. Didn't bother going back the last day for such bad service. Can get a real good local breakfast outside for less than rm10. Only stayed here as easy access to the exhibition halls and easy to get to the shopping centre opposite for food and shopping. Train station is really close and if your getting a taxi please make a booking the day before.

Even though the restaurant was closing up they still let us continue on and finish off our Drinks. Staff was also very friendly. Will definitely go back.

Small tv screen incase you get board and I was even provided free 30minutes Wi-Fi on board. Staff was very polite and well mannered. Only thing Malindo needs to sort out is the business lounge room at KLIA as since they moved from KLIA2 there isn't any lounge Access and you just get a rm20 voucher to use at 4 different locations.

It didn't disappoint. Although we were the first table in the restaurant, we got a little worried but another 2 tables did come in later. Took a little while to be served dinner but it was worth the wait. Tasty and authentic northern Indian food in Kota Kinabalu. Will be back so hopefully they can maintain the standard.

We didn't make any reservations and got a seat very easy, there wasn't many people there though on a Tuesday night. Ordering of food was very easy and staff was happy to assist. Fish and Chips and Hot Dog for the boys and Mac n Cheese and combo Fajitas for the parents. All the food was very delicious. Unfortunately the menu is a little misleading for the kids. It states RM21.00 for a kids meal and upgrade to a milkshake at only RM38.00, so I ended up paying RM59.00 plus service and GST so it was a pretty expensive kids meals. The milkshakes actually took around 30 minutes to be sent to the table which we received halfway through the kids meals, not sure what happened in the kitchen that night!I ordered an Ice Tea at RM12.00 and the menu stated after 10.30pm its RM24.00 so do make sure you order your drinks before 10.30pm. We took our own birthday cake for my boy which the staff was very friendly in taking and putting in the kitchen fridge, however when we received the cake back one of the sweets were missing on top, not really a big thing but I think it's quite rude to take something off of someone's cake without even asking! I tried to find the waitress that sent the cake to our table but she never returned after that.When you visit other Hardrocks, kids normally get coloring pencils and a book to keep them entertained, they must have been out of stock this time round. A little disappointed but overall the staff was very friendly and personal, and food was very delicious. I would return.

There is a nice room of all the insects that probably at one time been in the park. Hard to imagine all the different kinds of bugs you can see. Nice short walk on the butterfly path although not too many butterflies there are lots of flowers around. If you keep heading down you get some small treks off the path which has some more flowers. Great for photographer's. Even my kids of 4 and 7 really enjoyed themselves. Not too many staff around but when we did see someone they was happy to answers out questions in English and Malay.

A few small restaurants and snack food with Drinks after the 30minute drive from kundasan. Tickets are rm3 to get in and the shallow river runs in a boomerang shape. Getting in deeper greets you with the bigger friendly fish whereas ankle height you get the small fish where some say it bites (no teeth) more ticklish though than anything. Can go swimming here and if you take some fish pellets you get lots of fish around you. There are some local staff telling people off if they are trying to grab the fish and are on watch.There is a local style bridge that goes across the river and it's blocked off when you reach the other side. Needs some maintenance as a lot of the wood is broken. Spent about 30mins here which was more than enough. If you have some spare time then go for it but if your limited you can avoid this place.

It cost RM5.00 entrance fee which was well worth it. Lots of facts about what happened to the Australian and British Prisoners of War. There is the gardener sitting there happily to talk to you about it all and he is selling a few souvenirs. There are three different gardens, The Australian, The British and the Borneo Garden to walk through and all have their own plaque, lastly you get the name list of all the soldiers that died during the three Death Marches from Sandakan to Ranau. My children found it a little boring but I really enjoyed it being British.

There are some entrance fees to pay which were no more RM10 I think and for children it was free. Wedding photography costs just over RM200.00 and to commercial Video's was over RM2000.00. On arrival you can walk straight to Barn 1 & 2 which is where they keep the adult cows which they are just feeding. You also have the calf's where you can feed them Milk (RM1.50) and Grass (RM1.00). The calf's didn't take the milk but enjoyed the grass. Great scenery around of Mount Kinabalu and nature. If you wait until 2.30pm they have the cows go inside where they deposit their milk which you are able to watch through big glass windows. There are stalls inside where you can buy local Desa Ice Cream for RM5.30 and the fresh plain or chocolate milk which is slightly cheaper than the local supermarkets, also on offer, is cheese, simple food like waffle and sausage and some t-shirts to buy. We spent just under 1 hour here relaxing. It is around 21C so if you do get cold take a jacket.

Common beers like Tiger and Guinness is served for RM19.00 (Happy Hour All night Long) plus 16% - service charge and GST. A few TV's around the place playing some live/delayed sports. Its a smoking pub but open front so non smokers are not really effected. Serves British food and the menu looked tasty but I didn't try any. Staff were friendly but not too many, two servers and one behind the bar!

Ive been here on many occasions when I visit KL for business and never got round to reviewing this place. So glad it's coming to Kota Kinabalu soon. This time I had the Jack Daniels rack of ribs for around RM65.00 and 3 pints (Special promo) of beer at RM90.00. The ribs are very tasty and fall off the bone and if you are a bit messy you can wear the napkin provided by the staff.No toilets inside the restaurant but they are just round the corner, but there is a wash basin inside if your hands get a bit sticky. Staff were all friendly and smiling. Around a 15minute wait time for the food. Smoking area inside and outside the restaurant, advised to book a reservation if there is a big group as limited tables. Definitely will return be it Kl in September or when it opens in KK!
hedger9uk|10E7962DA8D7588A7449E0E34D9F1026|Hotel|Kuala Lumpur: Fraser Place Kuala Lumpur|3| “Expected more from the great reviews”|review_400646951|Firstly my usual place was fully booked so I found this and hoping for a hidden gem but I was a bit let down on Fraser Place maybe because the hype but when I made the booking I paid a hefty sum for one King bed and two Twin beds (Same Room) including breakfast. On Check in it was rather busy and you couldn't really queue up in line because there is a bird cage directly in front of reception and ignorant people just cut the lines. On check in, there was no formal introduction to the hotel facilities and I got told that my room was only for two twin beds and that breakfast wasn't included. Hugely disappointing which meant I had to book another room elsewhere and I didn't get to try the food people recommend! However the room was pretty tidy and I had cleaning service in every day. Towels were a bit on the shabby side so bring your own! Full kitchen facilities in the room if your in to cooking but the only thing I found good about this hotel was the location, it had bars and clubs a stone throw away, more bars along Changkat 15minutes away, Pavilion less than 10minutes and KLCC 10 minutes the other away. TV was too small, my computer screen is bigger, so I never bothered to watch the TV!I wouldn't recommend the car park either, the lanes are too tight when your driving a big car and if your going to invest that much into a hotel, then you should really have bigger lanes down there. The car I was using sounded noises that I was close to the pillars on both sides and you need to take extra caution, no wonder there is so many scratch marks on the walls down there.Security guards were pretty friendly late at night and were doing checks.If my usual is fully booked I would look for another place to stay when I return.

Table was set and the staff was very inviting, friendly and accommodating. I ordered the small seafood soup for starters which was a meal in itself and was delicious, the roast lamb for mains, was cooked to perfection and a big portion again - would have liked more potatoes on the side though!My father and mother had the set meal for 2 priced at RM399.00. There was two things wrong here which wasn't to their taste (they should have read the ingredients though) the buffalo cheese dip which was served with a few tomatoes and salad and the risotto rice with duck liver. I personally tried the duck liver and I rated it.The kids meals - pizza's was great size but the chicken and vegetables was too small for a 10 year old. He had to share some of the adult food to be full.Good selection of wine.There is a piano in the corner and the staff let my two young brothers play some music (they go to piano lessons) and some of the other diners commented on how good they were - maybe an idea to have someone play a few songs each night to entertain the clients?A tip if your staying at the resort. We noticed some people kept coming in to the restaurant to order pizza's takeaway, one of the staff mentioned that it was cheaper to order pizza direct in the restaurant rather than get room service!I would definitely return as a local here in KK!

I would recommend they invested in some new menus to go along with the new vibe as the current ones are worn and tattered and should show some pictures next to the dish names. If you like north Indian food and don't have transport out of KK then this will fix your hunger. Most common dishes which is great, and you are able to choose your level of spice. The nann bread here is really great, and if you can't resist the small portion of poppadoms, ask for more and you get a bigger plate. Get some mango chutney to go with. The mint sauce comes with all starters and tandoori dishes so hold out on that if you can. I normally order the cheese tikka which is out of this world but opted for the tandoori chicken leg instead which was a great alternative. Some chicken tikka masala, bombay aloo and the vegetarian tandoori platter along with butter and cheese nann, scrumptious!I would definitely return as this meal always puts a smile on my face and the young male boss always does a great job on ensuring his guests are happy.

My wife and kids showed their Malaysian identity passes but still would only give them international passes. No information provided about the train ride which would have helped us out with small children. It took about 2 hours to walk round which is normal to my previous vists. I didn't see any zoo keepers around to provide further information to the small signs at each cage. This place could be booming if they invested wisely and made it a real good attraction. Like previous posts if you don't have enough time to visit sepilok in sandakan then go for the orangutans, but bear in mind this is a zoo and the animals are kept in cages which seeing hornbills and proboscis monkeys like this is disturbing. Otters were great to see but one of the sunbears kept running around in circles.If you want to visit here go for 1.30pm, walk round and then you have the feeding times for the sunbears, tigers, orangutans, Otters and proboscis monkey from 2 - 2.30pm and then the show at 3.15pm.

I was in patong for three night's beforehand and this was what I needed for a relaxing comedown. I stayed in the 2 bedroom suite which was the only one there and the suite was huge. I had two doors to my private bathroom, a walk in wardrobe too. Aircon worked very good. Had a kitchen, private TV room, and a telescope for night. Lots of water provided and towels. Swimming pool was great, beach was nice, bar and restaurant served cold beverages and nice food. Had the ribs, nachos, Thai green curry with rice. Did not let me down. Staff very friendly and accommodating. Great to go as a couple or if your working out as there was a gym with a few people in each day. Rawai is very quiet and you need to get a taxi to go anywhere. A few bars down the road for cheaper drinks and entertainment. There was a great market out on the main road in the afternoon which sold real cheap and quality local food.Definitely will return.

They have special offers on buy 1 beer and get 1 free from 5.30 - 6.30pm. Chefs are from uk and serve Greek and Indian food.

Only thing I didn't like was the towels needed replacing and the bathroom was a tad too small. Non smoking hotel so it was fresh. A fruit shop and supermarket just outside, great Vietnamese restaurants and bars everywhere and the Chinese restaurant right on the corner called Eastern Wind sold cheap beer and had great food. Very easy to get taxi's.

Because really you don't want to wait 2 hours for their food that is nothing out of ordinary- just like any other diner.If you are not in the mood for lunch/dinner, it's near Central Park so you can have a stroll then go back after 1.45-2 hours.The frozen hot chocolate is good though.

This was my second visit to Universal Singapore and it did not disappoint. There were new rides included too!It does get very busy from Friday to Sunday, especially over Saturday and Sunday, so I would highly recommend getting in early (opens at 10am). If you can afford to, I recommend buying the express pass. There are two types available, one to enjoy unlimited rides and another to enjoy one ride per attraction. I would recommend the latter, it is cheaper ($40ea) and there are so many rides you won't necessarily get time yo do them twice. You save so much time not having to stand in lines which can have a wait of anything from 45min to 2 hours!We bought our Universal tickets as a package (with a additional day to enjoy over 19 activities on the island on day two) and then got the express pass at the entrance itself.You will need to take some extra spending for drinks and food, not to mention to buy some mementos from the many novelty stores available. Also, don't forget the sunscreen, it can get pretty hot in Singapore... and if it does be sure to ride the Jurassic Park rapids ride which will certainly cool you off.My top 3 favorite rides include:TransformersJurassic Park rapidsBattlestar Galactica Human

We are extremely disappointed with the hotel, particularly since it's on Sentosa, and would not return nor recommend Siloso to anyone.Check-in is only at 3 however our room was only ready after 6pm!On arrival I needed the toilet only to find the floor covered in 'water' and toilet unflushed - disgusting! When I told the reception staff they didn't seemed perturbed nor did the rush to organise it to be cleaned.There is no hand soap in the bathroom. You are expected to use the conditioning shampoo as hand soap which is situated permanently in the shower! The bathroom is also very small. The shower is a loose handheld shower that when on fitting, you have to stand in the corner of shower to get wet and then shower water hits you smack in the face and can't be adjusted.Our kids' bedroom (totally separate room) was very dusty and had a TV the size of a PC monitor screen.The beds are rock hard and pillows hard and high.Our safe was loose which I feel holds security issues.The hotel is understaffed and not kept up.The eating area is often full of leaves and not big enough for all the guests. We had to eat breakfast, which I don't rate highly, whilst getting splashed by the rain!

We were apprehensive about the resort from the pictures and reviews. However we were pleasantly surprised by the resort and the area. The resort does need upgrading and more maintenance. My opinion to would be travelers is leave any expectation behind. It's a great area to visit and this resort is the best available accommodation. It's definitely worth experiencing the magnificence of the area.

The resort is good and rooms and facilities are adequate with good sizes of rooms and very nice beaches. It can't be marketed as a 5 star resort as it is lacking that extra touches that make it a truly 5 star experience. The food is below average and the chefs tried to assist with making more variety meals for us personally. Breakfast meal is the same everyday. Dinners are very bland. There's a reason why it's cheaper than other 5 star resorts and it shows if you like the extra touches. We won't be returning.

We required an early check in which which was arranged without any issues. Staff were incredibly friendly and understanding to their guests needs. We were skeptical especially regarding the rooms and the other negative reviews however it proved not to be an issue. We had an amazing stay. 2 Adults and 2 kids aged 11 and 1 were utterly enchanted by the marvel of the hotel and its waterpark and aquariums. My son swam with the Dolphins which he loved. Could fault it for much. We will go back when our toddler is older. We stayed at the hotel when it was not at full capacity, if you planning to visit in a peak period it will be more busier and crowded.

Universal studios have some normal rides and some fantastic shows and rides.. don't miss Tranformers experience and water world show. Depending on the rush at that point of time, it is advisable to take premium pass .. advantage of this pass is not only it saves time at long queues, one can go for repeat rides and shows using this as many times as you want. We enjoyed repeat for Transformers ride as we liked it a lot and also to some other rides depending on kids demands. :) Lots of eateries available and so food is not a problem . People with big pockets can even venture to the casino. Overall, it was just awesome time spent there.

We thought we booked a beach facing chalet but we were given rain forest chalet. Though we were disappointed that we didn't get beach chalet, the following days compensated our disappointment. We got connecting chalets and so 4 of us ( 2 kids and us) were comfortably placed there. Balcony view was awesome as it has trees all around. Noise of crickets was giving us good company all through the day and night. Excellent Pool, Spa, service of the staff, sports bar, lot of attractions in Langkawi are near to Berjaya (Cable Car, Sky Bridge to name a few). It saves lot of time to travel and hence one can enjoy the nature more. The resort is amidst beach and mountains and hence it is awesome to enjoy nature. Beach is clean and well maintained. If climate is not sultry, it is perfect for strolling out . 24 hours reception and service of shuttle is convenient. Being a famous place to stay, it's crowded when we went, but staff were very polite and service was good. Since we wanted to enjoy holiday, we didn't bother to complain on negatives written below. But next time if we visit Berjaya, we hope they will improvise on feed back given. Mainly, the food and room interiors and furniture.Areas of improvement :The two single cots in kids room were pretty old. The mattress was not comfortable as it was going down in the middle and it became difficult for me to sleep there. Kids can manage but that's not what we expect from highly rated place like Berjaya. King size bed in the other room was ok. TV reception was pretty poor with lots of dots and blur on the screens. No one bothered to come and check it though they knew it. The intercom phones were outdated and were dirty. No one cleaned them too. Air Conditioners and ceiling fans were making lot of noise in the night. Complimentary breakfast had wide spread but we being vegetarians had to be contended with bread and paratha with same oily potato curry all the days. Dinner was ok. I guess they give less emphasis to Indian vegetarian food there. Chef can take some clues from the near by restaurants Maharaja and Delhi Bhojanaalay which are with in 2 kms from Berjaya. Those 2 restaurants are saving grace for vegetarian food lovers and there is a Pizza place next to Delhi Bhojanaalaya. That's good too. Vegetarians can forget good food in Berjaya unless they improvise based on feedbacks given. Sea food lovers will enjoy i guess. Furniture in the room was not upto the mark. Too soft pillows, too old mattresses. Switches were a confusion. You think you switch on the fan, light is on though it is written as fan. Reading lights are a puzzle. The fan regulator knobs were missing and hence it was a tedious job to increase or decrease fan speed to avoid loud noise of fan and ac. If we keep aside the negatives for 3 or 4 days stay... it's a lovely place for family.. A definite revisit to Langkawi from us and mostly stay at Berjaya . Cheers!

Accessible location. Dated but comfortable interior. Tables could be a bit larger. Very friendly and fast service staff. Good menu and selection of medium priced quality wines. Antipasti which is recommended for two will be enough for four. Tasty. Primo (Bucatini con le Sarde) and secondo piatti (Involtini) arrived simultaneously. Unfortunately the quality and consistency of the latter was bordering on disgusting. Thus I send back - a tepid, greasy, tasteless concoction, .. a pity as I had higher expectations. Although I been charged nevertheless. The chef's absence thus lack of oversight might be the cause. Will try one more time during "rush hour"

Initial rooms were not matching our booking, hostel level, overall building under renovation with scaffolding. Next rooms (after arranging and relocating for two hours) were just about acceptable despite having not seen any upgrades or thorough cleaning for years. Breakfast requires to queue and is low average. Service staff is generally disinterested to serve customers as they prefer to chat with one another or immerse themselves in their cell phones (e.g. being one of four guests at Laguna cafe translated into five minutes wait for menus - while four staff were in plain sight; ultimately left after another prolonged wait to order). Conclusion. Overpriced. Underperforming. Outdated. Badly managed.

Request to open further booths was left unanswered.Note: You will save a lot of time if you buy the express pass (but beware it does not apply to all attractions)Rides were fun. Especially Mummy, Galaktika and Transformers. Waterworld show was cancelled as it started to rain (given high ticket prices something that park management definitely want to fix by either offering a discount or voucher or by modifying infrastructure).It was also the rain that highlighted the park's major shortcoming. Once it starts, you are stuck wherever you are. No transport, no covered walkways. Only option is to buy a S$ 39 umbrella (!) or a S$ 5 cape both of which will leave your lower body exposed while wading through the elements.You will find many food choices. Qualitatively, none rise above average (except for price tags which approach the zone of usury).Better management and customer focus would make this a fun experience.

If you have waterproof cameras- you can bring it at your own risk- but the AWOL guides will take photos to document your adventure. We made reservations for 6 -so we got our photos for free. We also had doubts about the chill- coming from the Philippines- during fall but AWOL provided us with wet suits and shoes. Our guide Conor was so wonderful- very patient and encouraging with our progress- making sure I would change my cynicism and lack of excitement. It was indeed an incredible adventure. A family bonding experience I will treasure. I will make sure my 9 year old daughter will get to experience it too- in a couple of years. P.S. I forgot to mention Conor has an open invitation to come live in the Philippines (Yes- he took real good care of all of us newbies) with a promise to Cam that he is in Auckland during summer

The only "problem" I could find(more like, the only problems my parents could find, not exactly me) was that a few of the wax models were based on how the people looked now. Not that I'm complaining, but you could've made them look a bit younger. Setting that aside, as I said before the place is wonderful. Many beautiful photos and selfies can be taken here.

You can go into the rides as many times as you want, and I took advantage of it. The transformer ride is FANTASTIC. The Cylon rollercoaster too, very scary. Then there's the mummy rollercoaster. This one was even scarier to me because it was DESIGNED to be scary! Jumpscares, steep falls, and unlike other rollercoasters, you can't even see what's going to happen! The place is very well themed too. There was this one place that was themed after how western countries looked like a few centuries ago, and they nailed it. It looked as if we actually traveled through time. The only thing missing were a few people in coats and suites with a smoking pipe in their mouths. Fantastic.If you've got a free day, then I'd recommend you to come here. You will not regret it.

This show is an excellent, fun and interactive way to learn about the history of Singapore. The actors did their job very nicely. The woman in the robes at the first location, the woman in the village, the woman in the quarters, the cinema theatre staff, the scientist, etc all were very realistic in the terms of their accent and looks. I'd also like to appreciate how they interacted with the audience and made them feel like they were actually in the place! Overall, very well done. Well worth the money.

First off I'd like to say very nice people. I read the reviews and it said good budget hotel.....well even though your paying less (and still not that cheap) would you accept mould? Cockroaches? Ants? There form of cleaning was make the bed and change the towels no changing of sheets and still the mould issue. Rooms are also very tiny. One good thing about them is the aircon did at least work a little bit.

But one ride had delays to begin with which I can understand happens even the second ride having delays in the same day its kinda just bad luck but still annoying. Then when you go to get your stuff out of locker knowing you need to take cards and doesnt have to be cash you would expect it to work. Well it doesnt, had to rush around at closing time finding atm to get cash out and employee we approached for help had no idea what we were on about.

It has been brought to a international standard county park (similar to what you find in UK and other European countries). It's equipped with water sports (Jet Skies, Paddle Boats, Speed Boats, Kayaks etc.), fast food outlets, horses and ponies, carnivals for adults and children (during April). The place is child friendly and recommends for families with small children, families with teenagers, couples. ⚠️ Warning! ⚠️ Do not go there in your car. There is limited parking. Hence you'll have to wait for someone to remove their car to park yours. And there's no way to take out the car once it's parked. I would recommend you to take a taxi.

The check in was really fast and there was the least trouble cause by the the process. We enjoyed our welcome drink and within like five minutes we were checked in and were taken to our rooms. We had some problems with one of our rooms. The Minibar and the hair dryer were LOCKED away and although we informed the reception twice they didn't bother to fix our problem. Next the bathroom - towels weren't there. They brought the towels later after informing them. And about sleep quality - it was rather okay. We were disturbed by some rowdy guests who went hooting and screaming down the corridor. About the food - the food is totally great. Better than Heritance ahungalla. The food was fresh warm and it was delicious and it had a variety. Try their Mexican stuff it's totally yummy. We also did kayaking across the river Kalu. And it was the best experience ever. Imagine crossing one of Sri lanka's longest rivers? And it was totally safe. No crocs no whirls no nothing. It was shallow. But avoid going to the delta side. Apart from the little mistake they did with our room everything else was fine. That's why I have rated it very good!The staff is also well trained and pleasant and very helpful. They were very attentive to our requirements. Except for the minibar problem. The pool is great. It's shallow and clean. Warning - the beach is not safe. It's really rough and it might be the last the last thing you do if you take a chance!Overall it was a very good experience.

Since my girlfriend Comes from a conservative family her parents stayed back at the hotel lobby. Her mom was surprised to see some Arabs showing off their private parts of the body to her and her sister. This is absolutely shocking. And some hotel staff had also told them that this isn't a safe place foe women. Moreover the aircon was somewhat terrible and the food was also very cold. Extremely cold. The waiters were very slow and they do not know how to handle customers. It's very cheap and I think that these type of places should not be entertained! They bring drinks/ beverages without them being chilled. Just made with tap water. The welcome drink was really cheap. It was sun quick; the cheapest cordial in SL which is unfriendly to Health. Let's just say that it was "with EXTRA WATER!!!!" My recommendation : This place isn't good. Place line mount Lavinia hotel, cinamon lakeside, cinamon grand, hilton, are much better, safer and Moore quality!
Adrian S|809A0B9C4E2498C83B6920A7195A2731|Attractions|Matara: The Shrine of Our Lady of Matara|5| “A very spiritual, miraculous church!”|review_202359452|I visited the church on the 13th of April 2014 with my family. It was very spiritual for me as well as my family. Pilgrims as well as devout Catholics as well as non - Christians / Catholics from all over Sri Lanka come to this church to petition for their special intentions as this church is a miraculous church. In my review I've given you some information about the church's history. I recommend you to go there. It's not a huge, fancy church. It's very calm and quiet. You'll feel the calmness and the spirit that you'd feel in European Catholic Churches. Spirituality is maintained to the highest order. Please take some time to petition for your special intentions and to pray the rosary. Also please have a look at the museum and it shows how the church was after the tsunami in 2004,December 26. The church has a lovely garden. It's near the mission house at the back of the church. If you do get a chance go to the rosary stall and but some miraculous medals for your loved ones etc and meet The parish priest for his blessings from God. Hope you'll find this helpful :)A little history of the church. The Lady who came over the waves -In the Catholic Church at Matara is a Statue of the Blessed Virgin and Child of which many miracles have been attributed.Several experts in Europe pronounced it to belong to the Portuguese type of sculpture of the beginning of the 17th century. It is cut out of one solid piece of Ash wood. Mystery -As to who brought this Statue to Sri Lanka, or who the sculptor was or from which country it came is shrouded in mystery; but the fact remains that it was with us when Portuguese occupied the western and Southern coasts over 300 years ago.When the Portuguese were defeated by the Dutch and when the Dutch Calvinists persecuted the Catholics (1658-1796) some devout Catholics fled from the Dutch governed area with this statue and hid it. Later it found its way back to Matara.The story of the statue travels, from the time it came to Sri Lanka over 300 years ago up to 1911, makes interesting reading.Legend tells us that a huge wooden-crate was hauled out of the sea by some fishermen of Weligama. When it was opened, this beautiful Statue of the Mother and Child was found inside, untouched by the seawater.These fishermen handed it over to the parish priest and it was subsequently placed in St Mary's Church, Matara. The statue had come on its own, over the waves, and given itself to the care of the Catholics of Ruhunu Rata.Cholers -At a later period during a cholera epidemic, which raged through the district and claimed hundreds of lives, the Catholics rallied round this statue and prayed to be delivered from the terrible disease.The statue was taken in a solemn procession through the streets of Matara and non-Catholics too, participated. After a few days the area was declared safe by the health authorities. There were no further deaths.Miraculous statue -Since then the people of Matara have come to look upon this statue as miraculous. Many cures and favors are claimed to have been obtained by devotees, who prayed before it.This favor has been increased by the travels of this statue, which after many an adventure came back, once again over the waves. To take it's permanent residence in the very same church in Matara. This is where wonderment comes in.In the early 1900s, after over 300 years in the church of Matara, the statue looked faded and worn due to exposure and the hands of thousands of devotees touching and kissing it.A Belgian Bishop and some Belgium priests were in charge of the Galle diocese and they made arrangements with then famous sculptor and painter M.Zeus of Ghent to “renovate” it.Accordingly, the statue was sent to him on June 2, 1911.M.Zeus not only restored the wasted part but also brought out its original colours.With due care statue was re-packed in a wooden crate and shipped to Matara in the cargo boat, “Beachy” which set sail from Antwerp.This package never reached our shores.It was lost in ransit.Cargo destroyed -The ship was caught in a fierce storm in the North Sea and was nearly wrecked. However, it managed to limp into Middlesborough the next morning. Most of the cargo had been destroyed and some had been thrown overboard.At Minicoy, too the ship entered Colombo harbor-minus the statue.The Rt.Rev.Dr.Joseph Van Reeth, Bishop of Galle, and the Belgium priests in the Galle Diocese wrote to friends, and relatives in Belgium and through their intensive investigations traced the statue to a man in Middlesborough.This man,an atheist, refused to hand over the statue and demanded a fabulous some of money, which was refused.In his disappointment and rage, he smashed the face of the statue with a hammer and threw it away.But the statue was recovered and it came back to M.Zeus. He repaired and repainted it.His was a labor of love and zeal. He spent all his energy and time on it till it was restored to the original beauty.Return -Bishop Van Reeth went to Belgium on holiday and undertook to bring the statue back to Matara on his return.He set sail with the statue in the steamer, Princes Alice.When he reached Colombo and looked for his luggage, the crate containing the statue was missing.Three days later a cargo boat, the “Uckermarck” from Belgium arrived in Colombo with the missing crate.The “Uckermarck” had sailed after the “Pricess Alice” had left Antwerp harbor and into this cargo boat had been loaded the excess luggage of the earlier passenger ship.Miraculous Statue The miraculous statue of Our Lady of Matara is about 400 years old. Several experts in Europe have pronounced to the Portuguese type of sculpture of the beginning of the 17 th century. It is cut out of one solid piece of ash wood .MysteryThis statue has a story intertwined with the sea. Legend tells us that a huge wooden-crate was hauled out of the sea by some fishermen of Weligama, a town between Galle city & Matara. When it was opened, this beautiful statue of the Mother & child was found inside, untouched by the sea water. They handed it over to the Parish Priest of Matara & it was subsequently placed in St. Mary's Church, Matara. The statue has come on its own, over the waves & given itself to the care of the Catholics of Ruhunu Rata(Down South of Sri-Lanka)Cholera epidemicIt gained it's miraculous nature through an incident which occurred few years later. At a later period during a cholera epidemic which raged through the District & claimed hundreds of lives , the Catholics rallied round this statue & prayed to be delivered form the terrible disease.The statue was taken in a solemn procession through the streets of Matara & non-Catholics too , participated. After a few days the area was declared safe by the health authorities. There were no fresh cases and no further deaths.Miraculous StatueSince then the people of Matara have come to look upon this statue as miraculous. In the early 1900s, after over 300 years in the church of Matara , the statue looked faded and worn due to exposure and the hands of thousands of devotees touching and kissing it.The first Bishop of Galle, Rt. Rev. Dr. Joseph Van Reeth who was a Belgian made arrangements with the then famous sculptor and painter, M. Zeus of Gehent, to 'renovate' it. Accordingly the statue was sent to him on June 02 nd , 1911 . M. Zeus not only restored the wasted parts; but also brought out its original colors. With due care the statue was re-packed in a wooden crate and shipped to Matara in the cargo boat "Beachy" which set sail from Antwerp. This package never reached our shores. It was lost in transit.This ship had been caught in a fierce storm in the North Sea and was nearly wrecked. However, it managed to limp into Middlesborough the next morning. Most of the cargo had been destroyed & some had been thrown overboard. At Minicoy, too, the ship encountered trouble and once again a part of the remaining cargo was thrown overboard.Finally the ship entered Colombo harbor-minus the statute. The Bishop and the Belgian priests in the Galle Diocese wrote to friends, and relatives in Belgium and through their intensive investigation traced the statute to a man in Middlesborough. This man, an atheist, refused to hand over the statue and demanded a fabulous sum of money which was refused. In his disappointment and rage, he smashed the face of the statue with a hammer and threw it away. But the statue was recovered and it came back to M. Zeus. He repaired and repainted it. His was a labor of love and zeal. He spent all his energy and time on it till it was restored to its original beauty.The ReturnBishop Van Reeth went to Belgium on holiday and undertook to bring back the statue to Matara on his return. He set sail with the statue in the streamer, Princes Alice. When he reached Colombo and looked for the statue, the crate containing the statue was missing.Three days later, a cargo boat, the "uckermarck", from Belgium arrived in Colombo with the missing statue. The "uckermarck" had sailed after the "Princess Alice" had left Antwerp harbor and into this cargo boat had been loaded the excess luggage of the earlier passenger ship.The 3 rd miracle.This is Her Story of the Third Sea Voyage. On the 26 th December (Holy Family Sunday) 2004, 9.10 a.m. it was the communion rite in the Eucharist. On that fateful day the congregation was thin due to the Christmas parties, may have gone for vacations and tiredness of celebrations. The main focus of the homily was looking into the example of the Holy Family of Nazareth to do the Will of God. This will of God is revealed to us in various ways but we have to be sensitive to listen to it.When communion began, one lady from the left wing of the church started shouting and was uneasy. The Parish Priest, Fr. Charles Hewawasam did not take notice. But he felt some uneasiness and became vigilant. Then he saw a van floating on the road just front of the church. Then noticed water approaching them. He shouted to the congregation to run to a safer place and ran towards the new building in the process of finishing. Many ran with him and followed him to the three story building through the sacristy. From the second story, the parish priest saw the sea water spreading all over. It was a flood. Suddenly the sea began receding. He ran towards the church to remove the Blessed Sacrament from the tabernacle and the miraculous statue of Our Lady. It was gone and the pedestal was remaining with the unbroken glass that was fixed from inside and locked from behind the repository, which protected the statue. Then one lady from the choir loft yelled, 'Father, Our Lady of Matara has gone. She has washed away. Run back and save yourself, Run, father run'. The priest filled with sadness and anxiety ran towards the gate, to the beach. There he fell down as a big pit had been carved by the angry sea tidal wave. Once again that lady, Mrs. Felicitas and priest's nephew reassured that the miraculous statue had washed away. Then the sea had receded and they could see the sea, one and half kilometers away the stones were visible.In this break between the first wave and the second, 15-20 minutes, they could rescue about ten persons. Then the priest remembered that his priest friend, Rev. Fr. Lalith Christopher Fernando, the secretary to the Bishop of Galle, who came to assist him in Christmas season was in his room. He rushed towards the parish house. The whole parish house was under water. There he gathered mental and physical strength and searched for his friend everywhere in the room but he was not there. Then he remembered his own family was in the upper floor. The staircase was broken. Fr. Charles' mother, sister's family and some friends who had come from Colombo was on top. He still can't imagine how they were rescued and brought towards the new building. In that rush he was able to recognized that Fr. Lalith also been saved and on the second floor. He too has been washed off and floated towards the inner quadrangle and had a narrow escape. Meantime they brought the wounded, the infirm and the little children towards the new building. Also he managed to save some of the church records and parish documents.Then came the powerful, disastrous second wave and it was the most destructive one. With that the sacristy wall, the wall which connects the church and the convent, the garage walls and the adjoining parapet wall of St. Servatius' College collapsed. Those who were reluctant to come to the new building and trapped in the sacristy with closed doors were washed away towards the college. It was disastrous. They drowned, knocked their heads, bodies on the walls and crushed under the falling walls. All the buildings behind the church was demolished. The vans of the two priests floated towards the college. Those who were on the new building, second and third floors were shouting for water in thirst, even the injured. The third wave too appeared which was about 15 - 20 feet high. The wailing and shouting of the people, their screams of anguish tinted with prayers were really heart breaking and tensed.Those who were on the third floor could see the whole town was under water and many have climbed on to higher places for safety. Then a police bus arrived to transfer the injured to the hospital. The injured were dispatched. The number of people who were sheltered unharmed in the new building was roughly 45. That time they rescued 6 bodies and determined that 23 were killed & including Rev. Sr. Bernedette Koolmeyer SJM who assisted in the communion rite.The parish priest with all this struggle and anguish approached his room to get back the valuable and ancestral jewelery used on the statue of Our Lady of Matara during her festival. But it was in vain to find that all was lost. These precious items were gifted in 1918. The priest lost his all his belongings. He was made a pauper, no cassock on him, no purse. He left the church with few people including his family and friends from the rear side of the compound, virtually as a beggar. They took shelter in a home of a generous person of the parish.After two hours, the priest and his friend and six young men drove towards the church for further inquiry of the situation. Then he was wounded was unable to walk. There was diesel scarcity and they parked the vehicle in vicinity. Yet others persuaded him not to do so as he was injured. On their way to the church, they met a young man carrying a bucket and had a shoulder bag. Then it was recognized that bucket was used to collect the Sunday collection in the parish house. This young fellow was reluctant to show his shoulder bag. The priest's nephew insisted that it was a bag which was in priest's room. They had to force open the bag and there they recovered the valuable jewelry. So Our Lady of Matara did not loose any of her precious ornaments.It is surprising to note the affirmations of Mrs. Felicitas and a little boy of ten years, Ashen regarding the disappearing of the statue. The glass pale of the altar of Our Lady of Matara was lifted and she came down with the water as if she voluntarily joining the sea tide. She was washed away as if she was going ahead to stop the destruction which was harming her people.Then onwards the priest was busy joining his people identifying the bodies and burying them. But then he discovered one of the pictures of this statue in his devastated room. He kept in that house where was taking refuge and all those who gathered at that home prayed hard for the discovery of the miraculous statue. Dear Mother, you have to come back to us. Your children from all parts of Sri Lanka and walks of life gather to greet you. How could be absent from them. Come back O' Mother'Early morning, 29 the December as he got up there was a visitor to meet him. That was Mr. Milton Hakmanage, who had been accompanied by one of the parishioner of Matara church, Ravi Rathnasingham. They were bubbling with joy and eyes were filled with surprise. They exclaimed, 'Father, we have found our Mother of Matara'. It was washed ashore 400 meters away. That was the land, the Sisters of St. Mary's Convent were eying to buy for their Jubilee project to be celebrated in 2008. As it was very expensive , the sisters were praying hard for God's providence. The caretaker of that property has seen a glittering object near the plantain trees but could not identify this object. Then he called Mr. Milton for further inquiry.The infant Jesus carved on to the Statue of Our Lady of Matara did not loose his crown during sea voyage and flee to the nearby land for three days. It is so tiny but survived. The hands and part of the foot of infant Jesus was broken. But they could discover this tiny piece of wood in that property devastated by Tsunami. Also they recovered the gold chain which was on infant Jesus which is carved on to the statue of Our Lady.Later the parish priest informed the Vicar General of the Diocese of Galle, Very Rev. Fr. Nihal Nanayakkara and the Archbishop of Colombo about the arrival of the miraculous statue once again. When it was brought back to the church, there was a large gathering to welcome her. It included the Vicar General and few priests from the Bishop House of Galle , some priests who were visiting devastated Matara, religious, the Mother provincial of Sisters of Charity Jesus and Mary, nuns. When the statue was brought, a procession was held with the heralding of the bells of the church. The awe filled congregation with tears expressed their gratitude for her arrival. They really believe that she walked towards the rough and dangerous sea to calm it with her glorious and royal son, King of the Universe. This King has power all over the universe. As Yahweh once calmed the roaring sea to rescue his people Pharaoh, as Jesus calmed the sea and cyclonic weather when God walked on earth as human, now the Risen Lord reveals to us in Sri Lanka His Royal powers to believe In Him and to have eternal life in and through him. After a short but emotion filled prayer service, the Vicar General blessed the congregation which was in tears and the whole nation at this moment of crisis with the miraculous statue of Our Lady of Matara. After two hours of prayer and veneration, the statue was transferred to the little chapel of Bishop House of Galle for safety.On January 02 nd 2005 , the Feast of Epiphany His Excellency Rt. Rev. Dr. Mario Zenari, The Apostolic Nuncio in Sri-Lanka arrived in Matara accompanied by the Vicar-General Rev. Fr. Nihal Nanayakkara & Secretary to the Bishop of Galle Rev. Fr. Christopher Lalith Fernando to celebrate the Sunday Eucharist with the people. The statue was brought back to Matara this time. His Excellency after celebrating the Eucharist gave the blessing with the Statue of Our Lady of Matara. In the afternoon the statue was again taken back to the Bishop's House, Galle until the church is repaired & renovated to place in its proper place.Written by Fr. Christopher Lalith Fernando after an interview with Fr. Charles Hewawasam, the Parish Priest of Our Lady of Matara ShrineDate: 16th January 2005

So it's not the place to have a beer!Another is that they're aren't any boxes, so there's not much room for couples.This is a good place for children or families to come and watch a movie. Most of the time the theatre is out of tickets so you should always buy the tickets before hand. And this is a theatre complex having multiple theatres. So you can view a variety if movies.

We totally enjoyed the room, which was a 'Villa'. The bed was totally fine and room had everything we need. It also had a little pool or should I say a 'mini pool'. Me and my little sister enjoyed splashing there. Everything was perfect until we went for dinner. We had to go to the main villa for meals and this was awkward because either we had to walk or wait for the shuttle buggy to come. Going in the shuttle buggy was fun, but that night we experienced bad weather and it kinda spoilt our holiday. We also saw a crocodile in the ponds surrounding the villa.The ambience was totally fine and the environment was totally different from colombo. It was less hot, the breeze was good. About the food - it was a set menu and to be honest, we actually didn't like the set menu. The food just looked nice but didn't taste nice. We regretted going there after we had about two meals. Overall I'd say that this hotel is not the best place to visit if you want to have the best holiday experience.

We also took part in the customs and traditions of the new year as well as playing the new year games! It was a lovely experience for us and we enjoyed every moment of it.The hotel has two wings, the Sigiriya wing and the Dambulla wing. Both provide luxurious lodging. Every time that we stay at this hotel, we experience better and we gain a lot of happiness. We have never regretted being at the hotel. Even this year I'm going to stay at the hotel for the Sinhala and the Tamil new year. The hotel always provided us with complimentary items such as fruits, cakes, snacks etc and it has been very generous to us. From the time we arrive at the hotel, we feel a warm welcome and we get the feeling as if that "we're home". They also provide you a lot of leisure activities. The elephant ride is just totally awesome!!! They give you an awesome experience. It's so hard to describe in words! Also we enjoyed cycling along the banks of the Kandalama Lake. Also they have a superb gymnasium. The Eco park and the paper manufacturing plant is also awesome. This hotel is very Eco friendly or environment friendly. Everything is organic. Everything is natural. This is one of the most unique things of this hotel. What I best like about this hotel is their HOSPITALITY, FACILITIES, ENVIRONMENT, LOVELY FOOD AND CONCEPT!They have the latest addition of a superb conference room. When I was last there it's construction was almost finished and by now uf should be opened. I would recommend this hotel to any tourist who'd like to experience the true luxury tourism in Sri Lanka!!!

Watching the flickering illumination of hurricane lamps throws shadows of history on the soft sand underfoot. The design made your heart skip a beat: a rustic island style Cadjan-thatched gazebo that shaded me from the evening sun and sheltered mr from the rain, perched on the pristine sands of the paradise beach overlooking the Indian Ocean. It is a quaint yet stylish venue with the ambiance signifying the natural aesthetic beauty with a setting that is nothing short of picture perfect. The cool night breeze will caressed me while waiters in ethnic island style attire cosseted me. Freshly caught seafood straight from the Indian Ocean is on display on a massive ice filled basket, to be cooked just the way i want it, grilled, sautéed, devilled, poached, fried or in any other style that i prefer. I enjoyed the rustic setting and live calypso band that plays during dinner while i tuck into my lobster, jumbo prawns, cuttlefish, squid or fish. Meal Times: Dinner: Monday - Sunday 7.00pm to 10.30pm  An A la carte menu is also up for offer for patrons during daytime
Adrian S|809A0B9C4E2498C83B6920A7195A2731|Attractions|Colombo: St Anthony s Church Kochikade Colombo|5| “A really spiritual, miraculous church.”|review_195338712|In Sri Lanka St. Anthony has many devotees and several Churches have been erected in his honor. Perhaps the most popular one that daily attracts people of every cast, creed or race is the one at Kochchikade, in the heart of the city of Colombo.One has only to visit this church on any Tuesday of the year, to see the thousands from North, South, East & West who come to pray to St. Anthony, to ask his help for some need, to fulfill promisses made, to thank him for answering their prayers and show their love and respect.The history of this church at Kochchikade as handed down by tradition and gleaned from the documents preserved in the Archdiocesan Archives in Colombo is as follows;In the 18th Century, Catholicism was still a proscribed religion in Sri Lanka and priests could not exercise their ministry in public. The Dutch were persecuting the Catholics but who preferred to be degraded, impoverished and ridiculed rather than give up their Faith; Shrines such as Madhu, Talawila and Kochchikade are souvenirs of those dark days of the persecution. (S.G. Per era, S J Historical Sketches page 14) A few Orations from Goa, visited the faithful in Ceylon at the risk at their lives. Fr. Jacome Gonsalves the Superior of Orations who is affectionately remembered in Ceylon as the ‘father of Sinhala Catholic Literature, lamented the fact the Catholics of Colombo had no resident priest. However a zealous priest, Fr. Antonio, disguised as a merchant took up his abode in a house in Maliban Street, Colombo, close to St. Philip Neris Church. (The old Church faced the road) The Dutch discovered his hiding place, but Fr. Antonio, disguised, fled towards Mutwal. He met some fishermen who knew him and his reputation for Sanctity, and volunteered to protect him from the Dutch, provided he obtained from God the favor they wanted, namely the stoppage of Sea erosion. When the pursuers arrived, the fishermen refused to hand over Fr. Antonio until he had granted them the favor they were asking for. Fr. Antonio then returned to his home at Maliban Street, and came to the shoe, clad in his priestly garments and with a large wooden Cross in his hand. Planting the Cross at the spot most threatened by the advancing Sea, he prayed to God to manifest His Glory, by working this miracle. On the third day the waves receded and an extensive sand bank was exposed to the view of all.The Dutch Government appreciated this favor and offered a reward to the people’s benefactor. The humble priest asked only the permission to live and die near the Cross he had planted. This was granted and the priest built a Chapel with mud in honor of his patron, St. Anthony of Padua. When he died after many years, he was buried there.The little Chapel which was made of mud was enlarged in 1806. And in 1822 one of the members of the Congregation went to Goa and brought a Statue of St. Anthony and it was solemnly placed on the altar of the small Church. This is the very image that is to day held great veneration at St. Anthony’s Church, Kochchikade,and the side altar on which it rests, is the altar of the ancient Church and stands on the very spot Sanctified by miraculous event to which the origin of the same Sanctuary is due.A tiny piece of the incorrupt tongue of St. Anthony of Padua is enshrined is a special reliquary and placed in one of the glass cases with a statue of the saint, at the entrance to the Church.Soon after the arrival of the statue of St. Anthony the work of building of a large Church commenced and the Church was completed in 1828. The blessing of the new Church took place on Sunday the 1st June 1834, presided over by the Vicar General Very Rev. Fr. Caetano Antonio. It would appear that people of all creeds, government and military authorities too included, lent their support towards the erection of this Church which continues to be a centre of deep devotion to the Wonder-Worker. With the devotees of the Saint increasing, this Church too became congested. In 1938 plans were made to improve and enlarge the structure. A Chorister’s gallery, large wings on either side, the Mission house and meeting room behind the main altar were added. On the 16th February 1940 the Most Rev. Dr. J.M. Masson O.M.I. the Archbishop of Colombo, blessed the new Church. In his Lenten pastoral of that year he wrote ‘The Venerable building hallowed by over a century of Catholic piety could no longer serve the growing needs of the present day. It called for replacement; a new and more spacious structure has now taken its place. It is indeed a monument of love and devotion to St. Anthony raised by all, rich and poor, but mostly the latter, in Colombo, as well as in the whole of Ceylon. May St. Anthony protect this City and this Island and all his devout clients and lovers therein.(C.C.M. of 1-3-40)The present marble altar in the centre of the Church was consecrated by the then Archbishop of Colombo, his Eminence Thomas Cardinal Cooray O.M.I. in 1951.In keeping with the new Liturgy, the main altar has now been re-adjusted to enable Holy Mass to be said facing the people and Blessed Sacrament is now reserved on a special altar on the left wing. The Church now has a new appearance with its terrazzo flooring.The miraculous statue of St Anthony at side altar has now been installed in a bullet proof glass case to ensure its protection and safety. And iron safe has been installed beneath the statue.Daily Mass Times :6.00 a.m - Tamil12.15 p.m - SinhalaOn Tuesday - Novena To St. Anthony :6.00 a.m - Novena and Holy Mass in Tamil11.30 a.m - Benediction in English12.00 Noon -Novena and Holy Mass in English05.30 p.m - Benediction in Sinhala06.00 p.m - Novena and Holy Mass in Sinhala08.30 p.m - Final Benediction in TamilOn First Friday Holy Mass at 6.30p.m.On Saturday Holy Mass at 6.00 p.m.On Sundays :05.30 a.m - Holy Mass in Tamil07.30 a.m - Holy Mass in Tamil12.15 p.m - Holy Mass in Sinhala05.30 p.m - Holy Mass in Sinhala

We booked a three bed apartment, at full price for school holidays and ended up in a courtyard room facing metal screens. Not happy jan, we have stayed at here a few times in the past. And it was much better then. Room itself was fine but lacked a lot of natural light and no breezes. School holidays was nuts. Feral children unsupervised . Pool area was chaotic as these kids splashed bombed etc was kicked several times. One day a boy was trying to drown his brother , another dad stepped in to save him, kids ran wild till late in the courtyard bbq area. So bad had to close up apartment. I know school holiday travel has increased noise levels but this was rediculious. Won't return unless I am guaranteed some sort of view (lake or ocean I don't care )and definately not in any holiday period

In an interconnecting rooms.,room appear quite nice but beds are as hard as concrete. Tv States over 20 channels, we had 8, and had to complain as no kids channels. Could not afford to eat breakfast there as very pricey. Hotel used for conferences which included drunk guests carrying on after midnight in the halls. Worst part is the last day we were having a lazy day , kids in pool etc. Well it was being used by a conference group. While I understand this happens a whole day is unrealistic. Also if notice had been given prior we would have made alternative plans and kept our hire car a day longer. ( manager comped us free movies for kids after I asked)Final problem was the shuttle came at 440am and was full. Luckily staff member drove us to the airport to meet our check in thanks for that, however I found it too little too late.

Totally the best shares on the planet!

Apartment was horrid!!. Smelled so bad a combination of old dust /Musty/Mouldy just terrible. So bad it set my asthma off !! Bathroom was so small you could even dress in there after showering. Cockroaches in the kitchen. No initial supply of tea/coffee etc. No tea towel to dry the dishes . Dishwasher didn't work, so had to hand wash everything.Previous guest rubbish in the bathroom cupboard. Place not dusted properly . Main bed had a cheap foam mattress (seriously!!). Totally a waste of Money. Blankets especially in main bedroom. Over 40 years old and never washed, I moved it and it left a gross feeling all over hands. Came with linen but it was all mismatched and didn't even cover the beds properly.To top it all off the day prior to checking in, I recieved a rude phone call from the owner (man)asking me for my credit card details, as it hadn't gone thru, extremely rude and arrogant. I explained I had paid direct thru expedia, and I had a receipt! I finally spoke to the female owner who apologised. No excuses for this. It's good is not good business practice.As an owner of a travel agency I won't recommend this place to anyone!!! Images is of how clean and tidy i left the apartment

We booked through the hotel (Mandarin Orchard) which cost us S$74 per person without transfers. When we got there it was noon and we were in time to see the Sesame Street Live show. It was great. Even we adults enjoyed it. Thereafter we went on the rides. The battle starts Galactica roller coaster was awesome. But to get to it there was a very long queue and we would have had to wait closer upon an hour. It was a holiday the day we went. However, I suggest that you take the express ticket so that you could enjoy all the attractions within Universal Studios and get there in the morning. By waiting in the queue, we missed quite a few. The other rides we went on were the canopy flyer, Madagascar: a crate adventure (it was fun) and Jurassic Park Rapids. The Lost World rock climb too was fantastic, if you manage to make it to the top. Overall it was a fantastic day and we enjoyed it thoroughly.

The room itself was quite large and spacious. It accommodated a King size bed and an extra bed. It had a TV, mini bar, safe, iron and ironing board and a 'handy' phone which could be used to take local calls and international calls to selected countries free of charge. Handy was quite useful when getting about in Singapore. We had booked the hotel direct and got the 'all for $1 offer' which was quite attractive. The Asst. Reservations Manager - Jaja Jose was very helpful in getting our booking confirmed. There are around 30 odd floors in the hotel and we were on the 13th floor (our room no was 1342). I presume the hotel was fully booked when we were there by the number of guest that arrived for breakfast and it was very impressing the way the hotel managed such a large number of guest at one given time quite efficiently. I heard no complaints at all.Breakfast was great with a large spread to choose from.The hotel itself is located centrally with easy access to the MRT (313 Somerset) within walking distance and plenty of shopping and eateries. If you are looking for Indian food, Cuppage Centre had a very nice Indian food outlet (Curry Culture) with food priced at a reasonable rate. The hotel itself is connected to a shopping mall - Mandarin Gallery.Taxis are in plentiful and getting one on our return trip to the airport was quite easy and cheap. It took only S$17 for us to get to the airport (day time).We were very comfortable and enjoyed our stay.

Housed in a colonial style building with furnishing and lighting to suit, it is very welcoming to anyone entering the place. It is best to make a reservation beforehand. However, we had not but were still warmly welcomed, seated and treated very well. Skipping the appetizers/entrées, we ordered the mains; Black Pork - with couscous, bacon and coconut mallum (symbol), Chili Chicken Dark Meat - with crushed pumpkin and apple cucumber relish, Tenderloin - with mushrooms, gotukola (a green veg), sautéed potatoes with bacon and truffle jus. While the food arrived we were served with a kind of crispy roti (2 varieties) which were quite good. We downed the food with a very nice red wine. The ambience was great, the food was fabulous and the service was excellent for the price you pay. Hope to be back :)))

We booked a two roomed apartment and got one on an upper floor with an amazing view of the Petronas Twin towers.The apartment had two rooms and two separate bathrooms, while one of them had a bath. It had a living, dining and pantry area. It also had a lovely office room and a laundry room equipped with washer, dryer and an iron. The pantry was equipped with a few pans, cups, plates cutlery etc.The apartment was amazing and very inviting to come to, specially after a long and tiring day of sightseeing and shopping. It is in close proximity to Bukit Bingtang. You could walk it there and there are plenty of eateries on the wayside too. The Petronas and the Telecom Tower could be seen clearly from the hotel.The hotel's restaurant, situated at the upper most floor has a breathtaking view.It is ideal for family or a group of people.The staff were friendly and helpful.Breakfast was limited and repetitive, but that was just a minor point in comparison to the rest.Housekeeping cleaned the partment daily.Travelling was not an issue either. There is a shuttle service that works daily to central points. We didn't use it. Taxis were easily got. Best to carry a card of the hotel as some cab drivers were not totally familiar with the area. We used GPS and that solved the problem.We had a splendid stay at the hotel and special thanks should go to their GM Mr. Anson for offering a great rate and being very understanding and helpful.We would love to visit here again.

We were picked up from the Hotel, late morning, as we made the booking that same day. There were about 15 or so in our group, from different Hotels in the city. We had a lady guide who was very good at what she did and fun too. She made it interesting. You have to be dressed appropriately to enter. No short skirts, shorts, sleeveless blouses or T 'shirts allowed. The guide ('Meaw' as she called herself) informed us not to purchase anything from inside as prices were jacked-up. She took us to a place where we could buy fruits and water, if needed.Also note that you need to be mindful of your belongings. There are certain places within the Palace you cannot photograph as well .It is an amazing place, worth seeing.

Built in spanish style these a huge rooms with fantastic views of the tea mountains. The backdrop is a huge mountain which is actually a forest restricted by the government. Would have been a perfect trekking place if allowed. The front view are the beautiful tea plantations of the place. The chef is one of the best and you definitely woudn't miss your home food being here. Everyday there is variety. The place also has an activity house filled with games like TT, Carrom, Bow and arrow, Harmonium etc. A visit to the Banasura dam, Tholpetty forest and drive back to my city Bangalore through the Nagarhole forest all summed up to be a fantastic holiday. The Thopletty forest offers junge safari's for just about Rs. 500/ - (paid for 3 of us) on a sharing basis and drives you across the jungle for 20 kms. Contact Nithin who is handling the place. Importantly, while you drive through the forest, remember that the gates close at 6:00 PM.

The breakfast was a great spread and indeed they lived up to my expectations. They arranged for bikes at rent which was indeed a must when you are travelling to this beautiful island and is a great way to explore. The routes are very easy to navigate and you literally are on your own with very little to worry about time. Something we did not explore and should have done for sure is the Langkawi cable car ride. Also, if you are a non swimmer, don't forget to go a place where it is slightly crowded for your own safety from a water and sea standpoint. Because overall this place is very calm and hardly crowded.

Amazing sea views, Jacuzzi in the balcony. It was awesome. No privacy issues as well. Also, we got to look at the pool villa and that also was pretty awesome. The breakfast was lavish, well spread and not disappointing at all. Variety of breads, spreads, eggs, sausages, hot dogs, fruits, juices and much more. The only call out would be the location. While i thought it was walking distance to the beach it was a little far from that. You'll need a bike to move around which is easily and cheaply available for rent. Remember, irrespective of where you stay you'll need to hire a bike or car to visit the tourist spots. However, Koi Samui island is not suggested if you are travelling with a kid less than 7 years old. This is a beautiful island with a lot of activities to do which cant be done if you are with a kid.

It's fun, thrilling, exciting, and an unforgettable experience. Something that you just don't want to end it.

I just found this to be a very dull skyscraper. However, you get to see a great and a huge mall and water show which is definitely not something you want to miss!! Just avoid going for the top view which costs a bomb but does not give you the view or excitement you'd expect!!
jaddyb0y|4405573A658A0EA41F7BE090660D092F|Hotel|Dubai: Golden Sands Hotel Apartments|4| “Huge spacious rooms and a great location!!”|review_477444159|The hotel was close to the metro stations making accessibility to different places easy. Loads of restaurants, shops, malls at a walking distance. The room was literally a 1 BHK with all the amenities you'd need like, washing machine, kitchen etc. However, for some reasons the bathrooms were really small.
jaddyb0y|4405573A658A0EA41F7BE090660D092F|Hotel|Lagoi: Bintan Lagoon Resort|4| “A beautiful but very expensive resort!!”|review_477441276|We stayed in a sea view room which had fantastic views of the ocean. The resort in itself was huge but definitely not value for money. Be it the ice creams, the restaurants, or even the normal activities, they were very very expensive. Don't go by their currency as what they have priced is almost as expensive as dining in a 5 star resort or hotel. The water is not clear enough for snorkeling and you'd have to hit to the deep sea for the same. Moreover the resort did not have the snorkeling equipments on offer. They have an amazing golf course. Their breakfast is lavish and a superb experience having it y the golf course. Definitely a resort to think twice about as they are many more options!!

jaddyb0y|4405573A658A0EA41F7BE090660D092F|Hotel|Pulau Redang: Laguna Redang Island Resort|5| “Excellent resort with an amazing island and stunning views!!”|review_477437665|This is the best island resort I have ever been to. The resort gives you a 5 star feel. We stayed in a sea view room. The lagoon which is right in front of the resort is the best thing i have ever experienced all my life as a traveller. Fishes everywhere from the time you step into the beach. The waters are crystal clear, serene and beautiful. The resort offers, snorkelling gear, a full board meal, sea snorkelling, two journeys to the conservation coral reefs and excellent service. You are picked from the jetty and can pay in advance for the private ferry they have to pick their guests. I have been to the Bintan island in Indonesia, Maafushi island in Maldives and can bet that the combination of this resort and the island is unbeatable unless you can pay a lot lot more and travel to the exotic resorts of Maldives!!

It's a few hours drive from Kuala Lumpur. The rides, the attractions and the casino, what more do you want on offer. All of this is within an enclosed city literally. Amazing isn't it.

jaddyb0y|4405573A658A0EA41F7BE090660D092F|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|5| “An Amazing experience!!”|review_477425688|This place is full of exciting rides and attractions. My favorites were the Galatica transformers roller coster, the 7D rides, the Mummy returns, the dance performances, the crackers blasted at the end etc. It is a great place for kids above 4-5 yrs as well!!The only concern is the long queues unless you can afford the VIP pass. Another couple of Tips would be to not do the Universal Studios and Sentosa Island in 1 day, it's impossible. Also, do not buy the magnets from here, as you would get the same and cooler ones at the $1 Market!!
jaddyb0y|4405573A658A0EA41F7BE090660D092F|Hotel|Maafushi Island: Kuredhi Beach Inn|4| “Excellent Sea view room, location and an amazing staff!!”|review_477422971|A brilliant staff was where the property gets the extra points. Shiham the Manager, Naveen and Jihad were all fantastic. They are so flexible ensuring every guest need is met. What was amazing about these guys was ensuring the guest needs and likes were ahead of the money factor. Their activity packages are extremely competitive. We had a great time snorkeling and with the night fishing activity. Maldives is a must visit country and a repeat, repeat repeat for sure. The waters are crystal clear and absolutely serene. The location is fantastic; with the beach literally 10 steps away. You can access both the public beach where bikini is not allowed and the bikini beach both just a few steps away. All other properties were charging about 5$ for the snorkeling and life jackets but these guys weren't. They absolutely had no intentions of exploiting money from the guests. Shiham arranged for an amazing sea view room the very next day on the 3rd floor which had fantastic views v/s the one i checked in on the first floor, the first day. The rooms are spacious, neatly done up and look great giving a AHA feel with all the modern amenities you'd need - Locker, TV with HDMI and great entertaining channels, bathroom with hair dryer, crib for kids, small refrigerator, a powerful A/C given the hot weather etc etc.Maafushi is a very small island. About 1.5km in length and about a km in breadth. It is a 45 min ride from the airport via a speedboat with a 10 min stop at the Male city costing $25 per person during the peak season. I guess it's $15 during other times. You also have a public ferry at just $2 from Male which is available all days except Fridays. However; it means you will have to take another short ferry ride to reach Male from the airport. Connect with your resort manager for details as at times you can have a speedboat arranged at the above prices even if you have reach around 8:00 PM Male time. You can access any part of the island and beach by walk. The beach is absolutely serene. Different shades of blue was what was amazing about this beach. Stunning views of the beach that just never fill your hearts no matter how much time or days you spent here. This is not a exclusive resort island. There are few hotels, restaurants, shops around. There are plenty of water sports activities for kids and adults. There is an amazing half day snorkeling trip organized at $20 per person with videos and photos included. They take you to 3 different coral reefs, a decent lunch, a sand bank right in the middle of the ocean, a dolphin cruise which was absolutely worthed. The night fishing activity was another exciting one, where they guide you to do the fishing and then serve you the caught fishes along with rice for dinner, all for another $20 dollars per person. It's an exciting activity as it begins at the sunset time offering some fantastic views and goes on until the dark. The island also offers the divers with the scuba diving experience. Even the non-swimmers can experience the same at just $55 per person taking you about 15 meters deep into this amazing ocean. These are PADI certified divers mind you who are world class. To sum it up, I'm in love with this fantastic island and Maafushi deserves to be visited again and again and again!!

I would say this restaurant is fairly good, but not great. They are not flexible about their menu, service was ok but a bit slow. The food, again, was good but not great. Left feeling a little underwhelmed and yearning for more.

KiddySing|239A0B9DB6025EA7E2C264F83E503E4A|Restaurant|Singapore: Chijmes Lei Garden Restaurant|1| “Utterly disappointed with ordinary food and expensive prices”|review_503449837|Went there on the suggestion of friends. Let me say straight away that most zi char restaurants (casual eating chinese restaurants) in Singapore have better food at one quarter the price. The food was ostentatious and ordinary at best. Had their "famous" pekingese duck, roast pork and fish, and was underwhelmed. I've probably eaten these dishes hundred of times in different restaurants, and will never go back to Lei Garden. I don't understand how the bland flavours could please anyone. We had about 10 dishes, and yet we went home feeling hungry. For those wanting good chinese, please find other cheaper places to eat at.

The rooms are small but what is needed for comfort is there. Strong, hot shower. Nice, comfortable bed, all essential toiletries, quiet. It is centrally located, and convenient to shops, restaurants and attractions. Breakfast is great with both a hot and cold food section. The staff were all very polite and helpful. House-keeping is wonderful, my room was nice and clean each time I came back. Very environmentally friendly.

I paid for a 1 bedroom suite with lounge access, only to find that the hotel was using the lounge for large group breakfast. There were long queues for the food. The lady at the lounge counter treated me like I was not supposed to be there. Afternoon tea there was minimal with few options. My room air con was not working, and despite multiple calls to repair it, it wasn't. There was no offer to change rooms. Others have written about the lifts.

Actually, they were only interested in moving people along. And please fix the parking congestion on weekends.

For example free shuttle from West carpark on weekends and holidays. Or open the back entrance for RWS. Parking was very frustrating.

Even though it is in the East, it is not that near airport. The city hotels are probably as easy to get to. It is situated very near Changi beach with a nice boardwalk along the coast, many nice eateries and a bit of a rustic feel. The rooms are basic. In my room, the aircon was cold and noisy. Facilties are basic and the shower/bathtub are combined. Rooms are quite small. There are spaces around the hotel to relax and chill.

There are activities for all ages. My 80 year old mum had fun! The rides range from mild to exhilarating. Set aside at least half a day to experience the place.
KiddySing|239A0B9DB6025EA7E2C264F83E503E4A|Hotel|Sentosa Island: Amara Sanctuary Resort Sentosa|4| “Great value for money, excellent service”|review_476975820|This hotel is great value for money seeing that it is situated in Sentosa, has large rooms, service is excellent and the facilities are good. So why do I give it only 4 stars? Through no fault of their own. It's just that the hotel is a short walk from all the attractions, whereas the other hotels in Sentosa are in the thick of things, or have all shuttle to take you places in Sentosa. The buildings are old colonial buildings, so even though the refurbishment has been great, it feels old, which is what it is but not what I loom for in a hotel. When it rains, you need an umbrella to get from the lobby to your room if you stay in one of the villas. But as I said, for the price point, you get a hotel on a resort island, good range of amenities, a firm bed and pillows (which I like), and great service.
KiddySing|239A0B9DB6025EA7E2C264F83E503E4A|Hotel|Singapore: Hilton Singapore|3| “Sterile, utilitarian rooms, lounge staff were overwhelmed by number of guests, busloads of tourists”|review_443270035|I stayed here for a short staycation. Generally the staff were ok and polite. Check-in was quick and efficient. However, the lifts can get very busy at certain times, for example when tour groups check-in at the same time. The food at the executive lounge was disappointing. The options and service at their sister property, the Conrad, is much better. It wasn't the fault of the staff, they were overwhelmed with the number of guests at the lounge.The rooms are ok, utilitarian as mentioned. The bathroom is quite small with just barely enough space for 1 person, there is a bath in the room though. The location is good, minutes away from Orchard road and Orchard MRT station.
KiddySing|239A0B9DB6025EA7E2C264F83E503E4A|Hotel|Sentosa Island: Sofitel Singapore Sentosa Resort & Spa|3| “Fantastic rooms, service was a bit of a letdown”|review_437694588|This is the 16th hotel I have stayed in this year, so I consider myself a bit of an expert about hotels. First off, the rooms are fantastic. Modern, clean, thoughtful laid out, well-lit, spaced out nicely. What I was not impressed by was the service. The impression was that the staff were just doing their job rather than looking out for the guests.First, I was not acknowledged as an Accor elite member and not given my welcome drink vouchers at check-in. There was no introduction of the place, the fish spa, nothing at all. And the staff were not busy, I was the only person checking-in. Second, when I went for breakfast the next day, the lady at the reception took my room number and then that was it. I was not brought to a table, not asked by anyone where I preferred to sit. I found a table on my own. I had to ask for tea, no one came to ask me. Third, I had a 60 minute massage at the spa, only to find when I logged into the hotel website later that they had a promotion for a 90-minute massage for less than what I paid for the 60 minute one! And yes, I qualified for the cheaper rate because it was a weekday at the time stipulated. Lastly, on checking out, no one asked to help me with my bags. Great hotels are made by the amenities and staff. Sadly, the service let me down.
KiddySing|239A0B9DB6025EA7E2C264F83E503E4A|Hotel|Kuala Lumpur: Pullman Kuala Lumpur City Centre Hotel And Residences|3| “Great location, good service, adequate at this price point.”|review_435469451|I stayed at the residences with friends for 5 nights. The location is fantastic and can't be faulted. The doormen are some of the best I have met. The rooms are quite basic, all the necessary amenities are there, and the staff are honest. I left money out on the table and it was never taken all the time we were there. Breakfast at the lounge is simple but adequate. I would stay here again simply because of the location and price point.
KiddySing|239A0B9DB6025EA7E2C264F83E503E4A|Hotel|Kuala Lumpur: Shangri-La Hotel Kuala Lumpur|3| “Good hotel, location not central, small pool”|review_429897017|This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel. The service is still good, and the hotel has some luxuries elements. However, the location is not that central and the hotel is old. I am a GC member and will definitely always consider Shangri-La, Traders and Jen hotels if they are available. And as usual, I will say some good and some not so good elements.The good - for the price point, the hotel is reasonably luxurious. They get the little things correct - kettle and charger nicely stored, toiletries topped up. They do comply to the green effort of allowing re-use of towels if I hang it up, and I appreciate this. The staff were generally helpful, and some went out of the way to ensure my stay was comfortable. Beds are comfortable and I didn't hear much corridor noise at night. Rooms had both a bath and shower, and bathrooms were spotlessly clean. USB charging points available. Lights are bright and easy to manage. The not so good - as mentioned, it is a 10-15 minute walk to KLCC or the Bukit Bintang area. They do have a shuttle, but the shuttle leaves only 5 times throughout the day. The pool is really quite small. Coffee and tea was not replenished until I asked for it. The room itself was quite small, enough area for the bed, a desk pushed against the wall and a chair. Why not 4 stars? The "good" I expect from any good hotel, and the Shangri-La delivered. But there was no "wow" about the stay.
KiddySing|239A0B9DB6025EA7E2C264F83E503E4A|Hotel|Langkawi: The St. Regis Langkawi|5| “Lovely new hotel, excellent service all around, beach is just ok, you need to know what you are in for”|review_426835055|Stayed at a premium room for a few days. The hotel is new and the rooms and facilities are lovely. The service is excellent, a shout out to Lebazda, Rengga and Mimi (pool bar) who were excellent.The good - the rooms are spacious and new. Most things work well. The staff went out of the way to make us comfortable, providing umbrellas and towels when it started to rain, giving us good ideas for what to do, drivers very good and safe.Westin, which is in the Starwood group, is next door. It has a better beach with water sports. Just get the buggy to drive you across or take a short walk. You can eat there and sign it to your room at St Regis. The bed is lovely, we slept very well. Freshly brewed coffee comes with wonderful cookies! Champagne breakfast everyday. The "need to know" - The beach is small. The pool is small (the Westin pool is better and has a pool bar). The butlers are shared, I was expecting a dedicated butler since we were in one of the larger suites. When I requested for a bath to be run, the answer was that it could be done in 2 hours time. There are steps to the pool, no direct lift access. We had to request for new bathrobes and beach bags - I think this should be standard in a top notch hotel.So why 5 stars? Great staff, lovely new hotel, good bed, champagne breakfast. Close to Kuah town with good food, taxis easily obtained.

I was disappointed with all but the char kway teow. The shellfish was tough and overcooked. The vegetable and no soup dish was very average. The chicken was way too sweet and non mushy. Most zi char stores in Malaysia or Singapore would do much better.
KiddySing|239A0B9DB6025EA7E2C264F83E503E4A|Restaurant|Langkawi: Happy-Happy Cenang Seafood Restaurant|3| “Good, in house dishes”|review_426556034|This restaurant is worth a try. They have their own style of cooking some dishes which was well done, flavorful and interesting. We had the tau foo and crab and duck with spring onion. We thought dinner here was better than Wonderland Restaurant. Wonderland was cheaper, but the dishes quite ordinarily done.

A staff goes out on another jet ski and stays near you to ensure that you don't get into trouble. Prices are reasonable too. They provided towels and changing facilities at the end of the ride. I would highly recommend using them.

There seemed to be fewer staff than before, and no one offered to help with luggage. The staff that checked me in and showed me to my room tried to make small talk but did not appear to be interested, as evidenced by me having to repeat an answer twice. The rooms are functional and bright, which was nice. Check-out was efficient, but again lacking the warmth I remember from my prior visit.
KiddySing|239A0B9DB6025EA7E2C264F83E503E4A|Hotel|Singapore: The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore|5| “Awesome, excellent, perfect!!”|review_416735465|I've stayed at 5 hotels around the Marina Bay Area, and this is easily the best. The location is great and the views are unbeatable. The bed is Super comfy and sleep quality is excellent. Staff are very helpful. The restaurants in the hotel are also TOP notch. The windows are double glazed, so sound from across the bay was not loud. The toilet seat is automated and warmed. Breakfast selection is not large, but this is a small hotel. Many, many historical sites are within walking distance of the hotel.
KiddySing|239A0B9DB6025EA7E2C264F83E503E4A|Hotel|Kuala Lumpur: The Ritz-Carlton, Kuala Lumpur|4| “Great location, very helpful staff, at this price level little things need to be done better”|review_408596022|Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. The location is great, close enough to the big malls, but not so close that it feels congested. The staff were excellent. A shout out to Mark and Mae Ling for their excellent service. Service is what makes a hotel top notch, and the service here is indeed top notch. However, I did not give 5 stars for a few reasons.1. Breakfast is just ok for a hotel of this calibre.2. Some areas of the room was not cleaned. There was dust and waste paper under one of the couches. 3. There was no pillow menu offered. 4. There was leakage from one of the bathrooms onto the carpet.

The price is reasonable and the location is great. Check-in, however, was not smooth. Was given a deluxe rooms when I has paid in advance for a heritage premium room. Must say the room was very comfortable, but a bit small. Toilet doors don't close completely, so be aware. The staff tried to be helpful. Views not great, and there is construction going on next door, though I didn't hear the noise. Right next to the monorail station and resorts world.

Would have given 3.5 marks.Pros - good location next to a mall, rooms are nice and new. Bed was very comfortable.Cons - the lifts are slow and often packed. Front desk does not have autonomy to adjust bills (took a long time but I was finally given the correct rate). There was a bit of a smell from the toilet that the Cleaners could not remove. Unable to log onto wifi with multiple devices on the first day.

The rooms are average and of decent size. The bed was quite comfortable. One light stopped working but was repaired quickly. Sound can be heard from the rooms around. The aircon was too cold such that there was condensation on the doors and on the ground. There are a lot of steps. Be mindful of that if climbing is a problem. There isn't that much to do. There were some sandflies on the beach.

The check-in was quick and friendly. The room is lovely - day curtains, good temperature control, comfortable bed, full set of amenities. The hotel itself is wonderful. The restaurants are good, the staff are helpful. Just be aware that the hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk from the main shopping thoroughfare and subway station. That works for some. Maybe just a small comment for improvement. We were only told briefly about the benefits of staying in a suite. We called for the butler, we did give us a bit more information. We ordered coffee and only found out at check-out that it was complimentary. We are still unaware if breakfast in the room is part of the package.
KiddySing|239A0B9DB6025EA7E2C264F83E503E4A|Hotel|Melaka: The Majestic Malacca|4| “Great hotel with good service, a walk to the main tourist attractions though”|review_376048088|I stayed here for 1 night about a year ago. The hotel is lovely, the staff are very helpful and the rooms are great. Sitting in the lobby was relaxing. I went on the walking tour organised by the hotel, and this was very educational. It was hot though, and I had a headache at the end of the tour, but that is not the fault of the hotel. Be aware that the hotel is about a 20 minute walk from the main attractions such as Jonker street, the museums around it and the Dutch square. Because of that, I would probably stay elsewhere the next time I am in Melaka.

Check-in was pleasant and quick. The lobby is grand and elegant. The rooms, however, are just average. The room I had was not particularly large, and the furniture was showing its age. The drawers did not open smoothly. The bed is firm, and it took me a while to get used to it, even though I use a fairly firm bed at home. The shower has separate taps for hot and cold water, which is a peeve of mine. The view I had was of the 2 hotels next to it, but I could see a bit of the Marina Bay. The bedside lamps are old, and 1 fell off in the middle of the night when I turned and my pillow brushed against it! I have stayed at the Ritz Carlton and Pan Pacific, both of which are nearly. I would choose the Pan Pac anyday.

The hotel is close to the sea and to eateries, so can't complain about the surroundings. The rooms are decent, but quite small, beds quite comfortable. The buffet breakfast and lunch were both surprisingly good. Some small hiccups though - cot for baby not available even though this was asked for during the booking. Otherwise decent hotel for a short break.

Loved the place, some things are very over the top, but there is a lot of history as well. Spent some time walking through the casino and observing the games. I did not spend a cent at the casino! As mentioned in my title, there were many many tables, so getting a place at a game is not a problem. Lots of places for food, the whole area is huge and comfortable. The hotel provides buses to other hotels and gaming centres, so you can make this place a base.

It is quite out of the way, so drivers should make sure they drive there in the day for the first time to familiarize themselves with the route there. The place is quiet, the rooms are large and comfortable, and the staff are very very helpful. Erravilla is close to other places to explore, so it is a good place to have as a base. I loved, loved, loved the breakfast here - they use the produce of their own little farm. There is a nice and quiet lobby to sit and chill and read.
KiddySing|239A0B9DB6025EA7E2C264F83E503E4A|Hotel|Melaka: Courtyard @ Heeren Boutique Hotel|2| “Small rooms, though size of bathroom was nice”|review_373010474|Stayed here for a few nights some time last year. The hotel is in a great location. The room, though, was small and the bed was low. There were 3 of us in the room, and it was definitely very cramped. There are a lot of stairs, so be prepared. Amenties were basic. Rooms had dust in the corners. We were given a room at the back, which was quiet. I guess my main grouses are about the place is the small room relative to the bathroom, the low and uncomfortable bed, and the staff who were quite impersonal.

The hotel is decent and I did get a good night's sleep. So if you are looking in the neighbourhood, it's fine to choose this place. But there were small things that could have been done better. The air con was a little noisy. The Executive lounge was empty by 9.45 pm even though the sign on the door said it opens from 7 am to 11 pm. Amenities were basic. The food was decent and service was pleasant in their cafe. The breakfast spread in the lounge is quite small.
KiddySing|239A0B9DB6025EA7E2C264F83E503E4A|Restaurant|Singapore: Catalunya|4| “Good food, great location ”|review_370274053|This is a restaurant worth a visit if you are in the vicinity. The food is really good, and the portions are decent. As expected in Singapore, it is pricey but the quality is good. Their paella is especially good. They are really famous for their roast pork, but I found it nothing to shout about.

The crowd was not large but we were mostly ignored by the servers for more than 10 mintues. My friend had to ask for ice a few times before we had it served. The food was fairly good, but I've eaten just as good at a number of other restaurants. So I'd say this place is a decent choice, but just be prepared about the inconsistent service.

For a day-tripper, I would say that the place was average. It did not blow me away. There were some nice, historical sights, but they were small and not particularly significant. The shops are pretty much what you would find in other Asian towns. Maybe it is because I am a history buff, but I preferred Hue more.

The Cathedral isn't large, but it is imposing. Do pay the price to go up the tower. The staircases are steep and narrow but the view is well worth it. For fans of the reformation, this is the place you must visit. You can take a picture of the chair John Calvin sat in.

The price is very reasonable. The rooms are quite small but functional. The place is quiet at night so sleep is not a problem. We arrived early and we had to store our luggage in the basement ourselves. Check in and out was easy. If a functional stay is all that is required, this would be it.

In fact I can say I was dreading this before it started but the group I was with had already bought the tickets, so I felt obliged to go. Well, I can say I was riveted. By the costumes, the acting, the passion of the cast. And the storyline was good too. The backdrop of the temple was just icing on the cake.

The grounds are also not particularly big. There is not much history attached to this, so I would recommend the citadel instead for those interested in the past.

What a marvelous day we had! The Reef is an incredible, must see, must dive/snorkel. On the way out we watched a mother and baby humpback play. Once in the water we saw sharks, large wrasse, nudibranchs, clown fish, bat fish, a large cuttlefish and so much more. Bec our dive master was knowledgeable and lovely to dive alongside.We enjoyed the lunch and afternoon tea provided, and ultimately we meet a great group of people.

Unfortunately it's the room the 3 star room which lets it down. The room is spacious which is a plus, but that's the only thing that works in its favor.The room is tired and dated. The air-conditioning and fan are so loud it sounds like the room is going to take off! It was hard to sleep with the noise at night, but to stuffy and hot to turn off. They provide lots of towels which is great, but in the kitchenette there was no bowls, plates, knifes or forks... not everyone wants to eat out all the time, so some very basic kitchen items would have been nice. Room/housekeeping want to clean the rooms before 8.30am every morning. On our first morning we had 2 knocks on the door before 8.30am. We are on holiday for Pete sake, give us some peace before 9am. Maybe this info should be conveyed upon check in?Finally the bed was lumpy and uncomfortable. A bed can really make a hotel, and a lot can be forgiven if a great, comfortable bed is provided. In this case not so much.Reef View you have the views but lack in other areas. I would not stay here again. Your price doesn't match the lower level in quality you offer.

Luckily we got a great table on the waterfront. Service was fast and friendly, and the food was good. My main was on the small side (Salmon) for the price I still felt a little hungry after. The pizza looked good, I'll try this next time. all in all a very good dining experience.
Gemma B|0F2F008E5EE6DC8B56FEE004AF317532|Restaurant|Hamilton Island: TAKO|4| “Great Food, however...”|review_508565958|Tako has nailed its menu and flavor combinations. I actually think it's some of the "better" Mexican food I've eaten. I give them a 5 star for their ingredients, food presentation and taste. We had a lovely server named Jordan, he was helpful, friendly and approachable, he served us with a great sense of fun and humor. Where Tako fell down was on timing. I ordered the platter and in that expected a platter. The platter came out bit by bit. All 4 of us diners seemed to get our food at different times, so it didn't feel like we were eating a meal together. some of the ordered platter was missed so I sat there patiently waiting. After around 40 minutes it was obvious it had been forgotten so we followed up on this. This was brought to the table but by this stage the ship had sailed. Tako is a big and busy restaurant and I wonder if the kitchen system needs to be reviewed? If this happened to us I have a sneaking suspicion it may happen to others?

We arrived early and concierge let us check in early. The rooms are on the small side, but are of absolute quality, fittings and all. Loved the music, lighting and coffee machine. Also the high quality soaps & shampoos were a treat - better than what most hotels have to offer. Was a little on the noisy side as it's right in the heart of Airlie beach, but I notice because I'm a light sleeper. I thought this hotel was awesome and I would both recommend and stay again.

The food was good, but the meals were small and expensive. The service was just ok. The waiters often forgot to come to the table we had to call them over on quite a few occasions. The restaurant looks a little tired and run down. I was expecting a 5 star dining experience, especially for the price, however I feel it fell a little short... it was missing the X factor.

The food wasn't bad but it wasn't spectacular. The service was average. While paying for the meal out waitress picked up our belongings and brought them into the bar area, rushing us on our way.

It has some great points. Being up off the road, it's a little quieter. The rooms are clean and spacious however I found my bed to be quite lumpy and uncomfortable. It's very reasonably priced and the breakfast was good. The photo of trip advisor is a little deceiving as the sea views from the pool are no longer... new building obstruct this. The bath on the balcony is lovely however not very private so apart from being a novelty I don't know how practical it really is. Overall I am happy with the resort and would recommend to others.

The staff were completely inefficient at running the lines and slides, it was almost a joke to watch. When I went to buy an express pass for my family the woman would not sell it to me as she needed to 'see' everybody. We had 5 adults all the same height as me, but she refused to take my word for it. I had walked all the way across the park to do this - what a waste of time. Overpriced for the very average slides available. Don't waste your time. Go to Wet Wet Wild Water Park instead!

I am happy to report that our meals - pizzas and pastas - were surprisingly delicious. I could go as far as saying that the truffle pizza was one of the best I've ever had. All 6 of us were happy with our meals. The only let down was that the spaghetti bolognese was not available (my first choice of meals). Overall well done Tino's.

I understand Singapore is expensive and this is fine if the quality of ingredients is there, but this was the equivalent to a cheap pub meal with a fine dining price tag.

The room was nothing special, however it was clean and comfortable! I would give the room a 3 out of 5 rating. The part that really makes the Heritage is the location and the grounds. The grounds are sprawling with trees and gardens. Beautifully manicured. The hotel has a pool and tennis court. Both well cared for. The location is brilliant! Right in the heart of Hanmer. The hotel has a lovely feel to it overall. I would definitely recommend.

After ordering an icecream I went to pay. The log cabin does not have visa! And I did not have any other payment method! Hanmer is a resort town with a huge number of tourist coming through. When traveling it is extremely common to use visa as a payment method. I had to walk back to the hotel to get another card (a 20 minute round trip) to pay for the icecream. The whole situation was frustrating.

Room is spacious and clean, I like the interior. They gave us a complimentary newspaper in the AM. I enjoyed the fitness center and the pool. Parking is free for customers. They are attentive to our needs and handed us umbrellas since it was raining when we went there and wanted to go outside. Toys for the kids were given while checking out. And oh, they allowed us to check out late :) Wifi is also fast. Great customer service. Great experience
Kay D|CF0843CB9805151FDA3F489554248D2F|Attractions|Mabini: Planet Dive|4| “Pet friendly dive shop”|review_502389160|Visited this resort for the second time, this time we booked a room (yellow room) it has a queen sized bed and 2 single bed. We checked in late 11pm. Tip: it is much cheaper if you book the hotel to Planet dive (3500) itself rather than booking it from Agoda (2500) because it includes 4 meals. We booked through Agoda and have to pay for 500/pax for a breakfast buffet (egg, longganisa, ham, corned beef, soup , juice and coffee). Diving as usual is great except for their equipments who needs upgrading (im getting my own soon). Hotel is currently updating putting a pool, i hope the room gets upgraded too. This resort is a pet friendly which is a plus for me. Best part is they allowed us to check out late since I finished diving late. Thats customer service :)

Since we will be staying most of the time outside, this was a nice option since its cheap considering that it is situated at Station 1. Our room had 2 double bed, free internet. A rustic feel which needs refurbishment. No breakfast included. Basic accomodation. Staff was helpful. Overall I would recommend this place if you are looking for a cheap decent safe place.

Went there with our tickets bought online which I think is much cheaper than buying it there and will save you a lot of time. We went there 10 am which is their opening hour which I recommend since line from queue is still short. While it was scorching hot when we visited. I must say that I enjoyed The Mummy, Transformers, Battlestar Galactica, a must ride for adults. I tried exchanging my local currency to Sgd and rates are way higher when you do it there. Just walk a few steps to Resorts World they also have money changer there. :)

We went there lunch time. Parking lot was a breeze. Although they have only 2 servers during that time I have no complain since they were very attentive. They have one common comfort room and a wash area. They also handed us red bibs. We started with pumpkin soup which was by the way the best pumpkin soup we have ever tasted. This was followed by thinly cut steak which can explain why probably it was well done when we asked our steak to be medium rare . Steak was like the usual steak you can order at 99php restaurants/foodcourt. We only had one and that was it. Then we had unlimited crabs. We were handed only 1 crab cracker and had to wait for each other to be finished. Overall it was a great dining experience. Value for money was good. Will definitely recommend

I ordered for their set menu of Tonkotsu (pork based) ramen while my friend who already had lunch ordered for black sesame ice cream and fresh buko. I am not a fan of ramen but I find their ramen delicious. While the food was great. My friend noticed that the bowl used for the black sesame ice cream has something on it seems like a residue of previous food that was placed there. It was so disgusting that when we complained with the waiter he immediately apologized and replaced it with a new one. Value for money was good since the food was really great. However, with the cleanliness of this place, I think I will just have to pass.

Parking slot was limited but luckily, we didnt had a hard time looking for one. I didnt see a locker (I didnt also ask) I just think people might need one if you are going there for a day trip and dont have a car. Place was open space, cellphones, cameras and other gadgets were left, pretty much just sitting on the table, I even left money inside my pouch. I didnt lost anything. My faith in humanity was restored. Haha. Value for money is good. Buffet lunch was served. Diving wise, it was hit and miss when it comes to renting gears. Although I know you should own one. Nonetheless, it was a good experience for me. Will definitely come back.

Think twice if you want dive.”|review_406598967|I specifically talked with them thru phone call prior to booking that I wanted to dive at Apo Island, and if they accomodate such request. After they confirmed my request I immediately booked a reservation for the dormitory type together with my friend and her family. They even confirmed my Apo dive a day prior to my reservation. Hours prior to my reservation, que horror, they told me Apo dive will not push thru for some reason (they texted me that this was due to boat problems). I was appaled when I realized that I flew a long way just to be told that the dive wont push thru. I told them that I will just look for another dive shop. However upon speaking with them upon arrival, one of their staff told us that it is because they only have 2 divers at that time,They eventually booked me with Acqua Dive resort, and Im glad they did.For the resort itself, except for the EPS which most of the time was offline during our stay and the defective toilet flush, have no complaints at all. Staff were nice and friendly. Food was good. Room was clean and spacious. Rate was fair enough and they have a nice pool and access to the beach. Value for money was good enoughBut all of this dont matter if your primary reason for checking in with this resort was not met. Have to pay for another ride going to Acqua Dive resort.

They booked me with Acqua Resort and Im glad they did.Chae and Sean were very pleasant, accomodating and very helpful together with my divemaster Esmael and other staff. I felt safe and well taken care of. Chae also exerted extra effort to bring her underwater camera and took a picture of us, which you barely see with other dive resort. Dive equipments were neat some are almost new. Boat is big and nice.I cant rate the resort per se for i didnt stay there, but i must say it was well kempt. they have nice lounge chair by the pool, the comfort room was spacious, I just wish that they had a private shower room for the day trip divers.Theres always a room for improvement and as I read other reviews they were satisfied with the food. As I see it, other group had packed meal in a lunchbox. However for us 3 divers we had sandwich with a choice of chicken mayo, tuna mayo, etc. bread was hard, and cant barely taste the chicken.Ill give them the benefit that maybe, it is because they were notified that we are diving with them one day ahead?Overall i was very satisfied. I will definitely recommend it to everyone. Thank you very much

Red velvet cake was very dry, ice cream and coffee was good.Their famous Tella Ball, not sure what the hype is about. They tasted dry with not enough flavour in the middle. I think they make them in the morning and just sit them in the cabinet all day. It did not taste fresh at all. My friend had the crepes and I would get them next time as they are made fresh! Not sure why everyone raves about this place.

We had been watching the posts on Facebook through the build and opening. We decided to try one evening for a few drinks and some dinner. It was very quiet and not much going on. We sat down and given menus then nobody came back! I had to get up to find someone so we could order drinks and dinner. The dinner took forever and there were only 3 other groups there that were only drinking. You can see in the kitchen and the staff were just standing around chatting until the manager went in and obviously told them to hurry up. Wait time took about 40 minutes and in that time nobody came up and asked if we wanted more drinks so I ended up going up to the bar. Maybe my expectations were high, but being the only people eating in that place you would think that the food would be much quicker and the service more attentive as they didn't have many people to keep happy. Hopefully next time we are in Singapore things will be better!

Croquettes and olives were great however the Chorizo and Meatballs were so dry with a big slap of 'salsa' (tomato paste) slapped on top. We love our Spanish Tapas and that's why we chose this place but will definitely not be coming back again. The staff need to put their happy pants on and the food needs more flavor and love.

Paige8886|02737472ED7E060A065942B03FFCDCAB|Hotel|Yanuca Island: Shangri-La's Fijian Resort & Spa|5| “Bula! What a wonderful holiday! ”|review_450859557|We booked this hotel through a deal which meant we got it at nearly half price. I was a bit worried before I came as there were many bad reviews but I was pleasantly surprised.Room:We were in a ocean view room which was nice and quiet and quite big for the us and our 2 kids (3 and 5). Yes the rooms could do with an update and the shower was in need of some bleach but they are planning to upgrade in the near future and this didn't detract from our experience. They did have a towel shortage while we were there as they are currently renovating their laundry so all washing is sent off site. Sometimes this meant there wasn't enough towels but again not a big deal. Food and drinks:We had buffet breakfast included which was pretty good. There was a good range and plenty of seating. For lunch we mostly ate by the pool, the hamburgers are awesome and are about FJ$11. For dinner we had a few buffet dinners included in our package which were not too bad. We went to the Polynesian show (great entertainment) and buffet and the Spice night (slightly boring) which was an extra cost. Yes drinks are expensive and not overly strong but your in a resort so I don't understand what people expect plus I have heard most of Fiji is the same.Facilities:Everything needs a revamp which is in the works at the moment. The lagoon pool is where we stayed most days which was great fun. There's aqua aerobics and pool basketball which is hilarious. The kids loved kids club with the crab race and coconut boat racing. They had discos and movies at night and you can hire snorkeling gear for one hour for free. My husband and I tried the Flyboard for FJ$200 for half hour which was amazing!There is also a shopping arcade that sells a variety of things such as clothes, food, medicine etc These things can be expensive but you can pay cash in Aussie or NZ dollars too. Extras:We went on the Natodola Magic Tour which was so much fun! There's a visit to the village then to a wonderful beach to swim and play games. The best part is driving along the highway in the open air bus with the reggae music pumping while being served champagne! Much to our surprise we hired a babysitter through the resort so our kids could go to kids club without us. She was amazing and became part of our family. The kids loved her and it was so convenient having someone to sit in the room during nap time while we could go get lunch. Service:Everyone in the resort is amazingly friendly. Expect to be saying 'Bula' all day! Our room wasn't cleaned on the Sunday but I think it got missed, we simply rang the next day and mentioned that we wanted to have it cleaned before our kids nap time and this was done.The main thing to remember and a few people were getting impatient about is you have to get used to 'Fiji time', the people here are very relaxed and not in a rush so you just have to go with it. It's not like we had anywhere else to be so by the second day we knew everything would take longer (example the kids lunch) so we ordered earlier, easy! Overall: We are already planning the next trip here. We all had a such a great time and it was so relaxing! People are saying it's expensive for what it is and maybe so but I was very happy with the price I paid as I waited for a deal and got it at half price plus extras included. We didn't really watch our spending and at the end of the 8 nights we had spent about $3000 Australian. We found this to be really good as we were also paying for 2 adults next door. This included 2 shows and buffet dinners, tour, room service, clothes shopping, snacks, drinks, fly board rides for 3, putt putt, ice cream, lunches and souvenirs. So I believe this to be very reasonable for 4 adults and 2 kids to have a great time. I'm quite surprised by people who commented they waited in reception for 10 hours (why wouldn't you put your swimmers on and lay by the pool?) or didn't get a menu for 45minutes (maybe get up and get one yourself?) I found this very arrogant and not really getting into the Fiji spirit. I don't understand why people go onholidays then whinge how expensive it is. I don't think you should fly to another country if you want to save money! Anyway don't listen to the whingers, if you want a relaxing holiday full of wonderful happy staff and mounds of activities with palm trees as well then this is the place to stay! Vinaka!

Although pricey, the facilities are great.The kids had a ball on the slides, swimming in the pools and playing games with the staff. My son loved the Xbox room and that kept him busy while we finished our dinner.We had a good package that included breakfast and dinner. However we were a bit disappointed with the buffet dinner as it was a seafood BBQ. We weren't aware of this before we went so there wasn't much variety as we don't eat seafood but that's a personal choice.The room was very small for 4 people but we didn't spend much time in it. I loved how they have a separate bath and shower and the beds are quite comfortable.There's free wifi and a kids club however my kids didn't have any interest in going as the pool was too much fun. It's right on the beach so you can still get food and drink service if you decide to go for an ocean swim. There's also kayaks and pedal boats to hire.We loved our time here and didn't want to leave. We are already planning to stay for longer next year!

Room is great for families however a little small. I had stayed here 2 years ago and I have to say the place feels a lot more run down then I last remember. The bathroom felt dirty, especially the shower/bath. I feel like they really need to get in there and do a thorough clean of all the corners and joints as this would not be done in general housekeeping (e.g. Grout in between tiles needs a good scrubs and the floor needs a bleach, there was a weird dirty smudge on the bathroom floor. Also under the bed was filthy). The place is in a great location within resorts world and it is so easy to get to the attractions that is why we came back.The staff at the front desk are great and very friendly, we were offered free wifi for 2 devices each day so that was good. However we ordered milk for my toddler from room service and the lady said over the phone that it would make 2-3 glasses for $9 but when they came to deliver it was 1 glass of milk. After 15minutes of back and forth she refused to admit she had given us the wrong information and we sent it back.The bed and the pillows are the most comfortable I have ever slept on, they are amazing. It's like sleeping on a cloud! Overall, this is a good hotel with good location and big enough for the family. However, it could really do with an update and a big clean.

But we just wanted to go on the rides and see some characters. We spent 2 days here each time and it was fantastic. Older kids might find it boring however it's just the right size for the smaller ones before they get too tired. Staff give out huge amounts of stickers to the kids too! I also like how they take photos for you on your phone so your not expected to buy the professional ones. Great day out!
Paige8886|02737472ED7E060A065942B03FFCDCAB|Hotel|Hong Kong: Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel|2| “Not worth the money”|review_434782424|I booked this place thinking it would be better than the Hollywood Disney Hotel next door but it was not worth the extra money.Rooms are dated and in need of a good clean. The room smells musty and the curtains were so smelly I couldn't go near them.Pool bar was closed and only limited drinks around the pool which was disappointing.Having a balcony was nice with a nice ocean view. Breakfast was quite good and having the characters come to each table was great but still quite expensive.For some reason there is still a lot of confusion about charging things such as food and drinks to the room, we had the same problem at the other Disney hotel. They took a deposit at check in however when I told them this at the pool one woman rudely said "well we have to check if you put a deposit down" then at breakfast they chase you around with a bill to sign as if you are going to run away. I have stayed at the Hollywood hotel previously and I would choose that again, I feel it had more character and felt cleaner. This one feels like a rip off.

We were amazed by the detail and quality finishes they have used. The lobby is magnificent with a large fountain and beautiful detail on the ceiling. Check in queue was very slow, we arrived by the free hotel shuttle from the airport @ 6:30pm. They moved us to the priority line as We have 2 small children but this went just as slow. Even once we were served it took a long time to check into our room but I have found this is fairly usual in countries around Asia. I would suggest getting a taxi instead of he shuttle so you can beat the crowd. Room was nice, fairly small but kids loved the bunk beds and kids area. They also left toothbrushes and toothpaste in the room especially for the kids which was a nice touch. I found the water took a long time to go hot, I thought they may have run out! And the air con is quite loud but overall we had a good time. Climbing the Eiffel Tower was a nice little adventure for our family although quite expensive for a short time. Le Buffet is pretty good but a bit too expensive for what you get, they also get worried you won't pay the bill and constantly ask you while you are eating instead of just waiting till we are finished. (Not sure if this is just a cultural thing) Aqua world is worth the money, my kids had a ball there.Overall we had a great time and would definitely come back again

I booked a family room for 2 adults and 2 children which is on the 2nd floor. We got there about 11am and we were told the room wouldn't be ready until 3pm (normal check in time). So we went upstairs and used the pool. The level of service up there is amazing, everyone is super friendly. We ordered drinks and while we were swimming it started raining. As we were jumping out to move our stuff, the staff were already moving our towels and drinks so they didn't get wet. How nice is that?! We then went down to see if our room was ready so our kids could have a sleep. It wasn't as there aren't many family rooms so they upgraded us to a club room which was amazing. I was worried about the room with the four of us however there was a lounge, rollaway bed and a large bed and still room to dance around the TV if you wanted. It was on the 41st floor with a massive bathroom AND we got access to club 55 for afternoon tea, canapés and breakfast the next morning. The staff were so lovely to our 2 small children even when I was worried they would disturb everyone at breakfast! I can't wait to come back and stay for longer, it's definitely worth the money.

The staff are very friendly especially to the kids. We bought an annual pass as they were on sale and was cheaper then buying tickets for three days. We visited 2 years ago and everything is looking slightly more run down and in need of renovation. A few little things around the park such as the water cannons didn't work however the kids still had a great time. They really like the waterpark and floating around the river. There was a fantastic staff member there who entertained them by building rafts out of Lego and pushing them around in it. Not sure how good the quality will be in a few years as paint is peeling and concrete cracking however the kids loved it and they don't notice that stuff. Would go back again as it was so entertaining and good value.

The room was very child orientated with a treasure hunt, bunk beds and Lego to play with. Downstairs they have even more Lego to play with which was good to entertain the kids early in the morning before breakfast. But the kids especially loved playing Just Dance on the XBox and ate their breakfast really fast so they could go back and play. The Bricks restaurant is great for kids they loved the fact you can draw on the tables at dinner. You can buy alcohol at dinner and they don't mind at all which is not what I read on a few other reviews. The staff are absolutely amazing and treat the kids like royalty. I can't wait to come back with a big group and show them how great it is!

Everything is well written to understand and trains are so frequent longest wait was 3 minutes coming from Sydney where we're used to 15min +.Bird Show was fantastic. Got up close to a Toucan. Beautiful waterfall near the end of the park, lovely photo opportunities. Extremely hot day, water stations were great. Bought a fan with water which made kids happy. Lots of different birds from around the world.Great day. Took approx 2 1/2 hours.Had Pizza Hut for lunch.

Very easy and convenient and overall CHEAP! Did River Safari before Zoo to avoid crowds worked well. Saw both Pandas real close and some Piranhas. Kids (aged 10 and 8) loved the River Quest raft ride, an exciting fun way to see some animals. Got up close with some monkeys. River Cruise only one boat was going had to wait approx 20min could have left that ride. Not a huge park easy walking and done within 2 hours. Easy.

Went to Sentosa Island via MRT to Harbourtown and then $4.00 pp for a tramride to Sentosa Island. Took approx 20 min.Arrived before opening 9.45ish. Pre-printed ticket bought online from main website, easy access... made a bee line for the Transformers ride no queue then onto Mummy Ride (not for the faint hearted extreme roller coaster in the dark) and then Jurassic Ride which was my children's favourite (aged 10 & 8). The Jurassic section doesn't open until 11.00am but we were there at the opening and managed to get on the ride straight away. After that we cruised through the other lands 4D Shrek show was great. Food wasn't great but not allowed to take in food or drink. Husband enjoyed the fruit cup. They have water stations/fans everywhere including in the waiting line for rides. Overall a fun day out with the kids, were done by 2.00pm. We then visited Candylicious outside of Universal for an ice cream. Then onto Trick Eye Museum... was quiet at the beginning however near the end was hectic with lots of people entering after leaving Universal I'm guessing. Made it hard to take some good photos. Kids loved Trick Eye.

Check in took a little while longer than most hotels. I really would not rate this hotel as a 5 star hotel compared hotels like the Hilton or shangri la. More a 4 star or 4.5 star hotel at the most. We stayed during the first week of April. Food and drinks are very expensive in this hotel and on the island in general, try vivocity which is a tram ride away for cheaper food options. Pool was great but it's a shame the pool bar closes at 8pm. The hotel provides you with a free tram pass for travel for 3 days, the tram is a great way to get around the island. The room came with a smartphone which you can use when you leave the hotel. It has a lot of information on places to go as well as discount vouchers. It great for tourists and helped me a lot getting around Singapore

One side of the road had all the big brands like Tiffany, Chanel, Gucci, Prada and alot less busy. The other side of the road was incredibly super busy. I think it was called Lucky plaza (or something). Looked like a great place for souvineers and bargains- but was the most crowded place I have ever been too ever-and I think I discovered I really don't like crowds LOL. There was nowhere to sit, food court full at 3pm. We ate at McDonalds, but alot of people were not eating, they seemed to be using the space for free wifi! (I suspect). Anyways we went back across to the calmer, less busy side of the road. Great Bookshop, hugest one in Asia is in Orchard st- called Kinokuniya. Anyways great shopping, ION centre interesting.

The staff are helpful and K Mohammad the concierge was very welcoming and friendly.Cost about $20 one way to zoo. $16 to bird park and $10 fron Clarke Quay and Gardens by the Bay. Great location and good place to rest.

I have been to San Diego zoo too (another bucket list item) and I think this zoo was even better due to some of the animals being let loose and some amazing experiences up close. 8 y.o Orangutans are above you inthe trees, free. Same with Tamarins and Lemurs. Up close with a Toucan too and Flying Foxes. The zoo like all of Singapore is very lush. Food is reasonable (paid $15 for an indian meal), yes it rained at the end of the day, huge taxi line-however the line was managed well by staff and we waited approx 20mins. Well worth going to. If you miss breakfast with the Orangutans, there are photo opportunities later in the day where you get close up too, something never experienced before especially with Orangutans. I must say I found San Diego zoo was more educational, but this zoo, as the animals up close, no bars is wonderful.

All rides were closed. We left the park about 4pm, having been on only 1 ride (snorkelling). One person in my family did not get to go on any rides and we were so looking forward to do the lazy river tyre ride as a family. Coming all the way from Australia, journeying from our mainland hotel with bathers and towels in tow, it was rather a disapointing end to our holiday. We fly back tomorrow. Whilst the staff were helpful as could be and can no way control lightening, i do find it astonishing that there were no undercover rides or rides that could function during what is a common occurance, thunderstorms. We were compensated by Adventure Park, but if you do go, check weather and monitor weather. We checked internet weather sites before we went but the weather reports change!! Do 'must do's' first-as weather changes very quickly. Rainbow reef was pretty cool experience though.

We ate our lunch at Kasbahs and had chicken and beef curries with nan bread. Simply yum with no after effects. Great surroundings.Went on the 20000 leagues submarine ride, cool but a bit claustrophobicFlying carpet ride lots of fun.Double decker carousel ride unique!Mermaid lagoon- huge undercover mermaid themed land. You will need to drag the kids away-a huge play area also with caverns and buttons to press simulating under the water land where Ariel lived and kept treasures ( i think boys would loveit too)Fortress Explorations- omg so much fun exploring something akin to a castle, kids can manipulate planets in a room,optical illusions to surprise even adults. There is also a 16th century galleon to explore and cannons to fire off!Toy Story Mania, got fast pass at 10am on a Tuesday- to come back 8:30pm at night. We never went as too exhausted to stay in park that long. We had done same ride in California so no biggie.Wonderful and different park.

Smaller park but some attractions BETTER then Tokyo and Anaheim- namely Jungle Cruise, Tarzan Island and Autopia.Mystic Manor is now my 8yo daughters fav ride in all the parks. Don't dismiss this park because its small. If you love Disney, you will have fun. Food was also good in Banquet Hall, fantasy land.

Clean, a view of the harbour, central to train station MTR, ferry, shopping malls and near markets. We were originally going to book a resort hotel with outdoor pool. So glad we didn't as the week we were in Hong Kong it rained alot of the time, including lightening, and was jumper weather. This hotel however has an indoor pool, which was clean. We made good use of it. We also had the breakfast buffet everyday. Great value. Will miss the Cantonese Chicken and Mushroom buns for breakfast. Would stay again.

Awesome, breathtaking and bucket list item. This tour company Greyline-very very poor. Bus late. They then take u to a distribution centre, where we spent an hour. Waiting. For what? A boarding pass- for another bus to drive u the 4 hours to grand canyon. Shambles. Lots of upselling. Disorganised. They already had us on a bus. No need for distribution centre. Waste of time in queues. Then, one hour lunch stop OUTSIDE park. Why? More on selling. In all spent 2 hours inside grand canyon park. Go to Grand canyon, but avoid this company.

The Jubilee Tea Salon is as grandiose and serene as you'd expect it to be and best of all, is that the tables aren't all crammed in as can happen, so you've acres of space and aren't forced to eavesdrop on your neighbours! We had the champagne afternoon tea with a hot starter rather than sandwiches, both of which were very good. But we made the fatal mistake of filling up on the array of scones and pastries which left no room for cake! We found the service to be spot on and will definitely be back. It's definitely the place to treat a loved one to afternoon tea!

We experienced a lovely warm welcome from the staff at reception where nothing was a bother. The hotel and grounds are tranquil, secluded and very pretty. It's off the beaten track which suited us just fine but situated near enough to explore beautiful Pembrokeshire. Our room was full of creaky character with a huge comfy bed. The dining experience was really good with excellent food and the feeling of not being shoe horned into the restaurant. We will be back one day.

Our room would've been lovely if it hadn't have been so tired and tatty. We had a bath tub in the bay window which was very pretty. Ditto the dining room being tired and tatty. A tiny car park that was beyond full. And then there was the unwelcoming member of staff (no smile, no welcome, no nothing. Whoever she was at reception, she needed some serious customer service training).

It feels like a business hotels in that it's a bit bland and dull but it's clean, spacious and well appointed. Both rooms we had were huge, clean, quiet and comfortable. The breakfast room is small and the range of food on offer is small but that said, is perfectly adequate. The dining room however is really rather good (a hidden gem dare I say). We had two excellent dinners there served by excellent waiters.

Having read reviews on here, the hotel didn't turn out to be what we were expecting! It's certainly grand and is spotlessly clean but feels like it's not been touched since the 1940's! The dining room was far too hot at both dinner and breakfast, which made it totally unbearable, and the food was pretty average and the staff aloof at best. It was completely at odds with our experiences of Italian hotels, granted this is Tyrolean. In all honesty, we can't say we enjoyed our stay and we wouldn't go back. Given the price and reviews, we expected more and don't feel it was worth it.

We spent two nights here on a road trip and loved it. What a view of the lake and the hotels floating swimming pool Great food and restaurant on the terrace and ditto breakfast. We had a lovely mooch around the Gardens one morning which was peaceful. It's a bit of a drive to Como to get the train to Milan but wasn't a deal breaker for us. A lovely romantic hotel in October when it's probably somewhat cooler and calmer!

We had an excellent dinner in Raffles the night before so this had a lot to live up to and it didn't disappoint, partly in that it's so different. It's contemporary and cool, not traditional and steeped in history. Up on the 57th floor you're greeted with the sight of the hotel infinity pool before being led into the chic, modern dining room. The food is really good and doesn't come across as too pretentious as can happen. It was delicious, well cooked food, served by attentive staff. The Red Snapper Laksa was particularly good. I could have eaten it twice over! After, we had a drink outside on the sofa overlooking the infinity pool and the view beyond. Then we swapped to the balcony on the other side where we could admire the view of the Gardens by the Bay. Spago is cool and calm amid the chaos and bustle of Marina Bay Sands and it's Skypark.

We had dinner here and it did not disappoint. From the moment you pull up outside to the second you pull away, it just feels special. The staff are polite and friendly without being stuffy, imposing or insincere. They're happy to chat if you want to and equally will respect you if you'd rather not. The food was really good, I mean really good. In fact the steak I ordered was the best I'd ever tried and I suspect everything else will lack in the future! The sommelier was just brilliant; she couldn't contain her excitement at our choice of wine and went on to tell us a little about the vineyard it came from! Yes it was eye wateringly expensive (£500 for 3 courses plus wine and aperatives!) but it was worth it for how it tasted and for all that it was and for the memory it's given us.

The facilities were excellent, the hotel was clean, the room was meticulously cleaned and re-stocked every day whilst breakfast was run on a military operation! The food on offer was incredible and you never had to wait long to be seated, nor was the food lacking or of poor quality (and were really quite picky!). The concierge bent over backwards to get us into Raffles and Spago at really short notice and nothing was ever any bother for any staff. The spa is worth a visit and is a lovely oasis away from the heat and bustle. The hotel is also great in that it has a beach and you can wonder further down the beach to see what else is going on on the island.

There's something about their hospitality, styling and attention to detail along with culture, history and setting. This hotel fools you from the outside into thinking it's a grand old dame. Inside though, there's none of the traditional and it's all the more fantastic for it. It's like someone scrapped out the old interior and has replaced it with an achingly cool contemporary setting and furniture. Especially the razor sharp extension that houses the restaurant. There's not a single negative I can write about this place from the little details to the food to the setting to the staff. It's all just brilliant! I would rave on and on but that'd be too boring to read so instead, if you're considering The Lido Palace, just book it! You won't be disappointed. I cannot wait for the day I return and next time, it'll be a far far longer stay, and on the top floor, if the budget will allow it!

It has has a lovely cosy, intimate atmosphere, the staff are friendly and welcoming and there's not too much noise from outside. The rooms are nicely furnished.The downside is that it's easy to forget to lock your room door (you have to turn the knob from the inside) and the room we were in was a little shabby and needed a good redecoration and a new carpet. But it wouldn't put me off coming back.

The staff are just brilliant; they were waiting on the jetty to park our boat, they fussed over the kids and made sure they were happy with their food choices and nothing was too much much bother. It's a real family business and the personal touch is obvious. The mixed dip starters are highly recommended and the main courses were all very good too.

We stayed for four nights in a one bed beautifully appointed apartment with well furnished bedroom, bathroom and lounge/kitchen. The apartments are in a great central location, just over the road from the station. The only downside is a lack of parking but you do receive a discount in one of the local car parks. Our dishwasher was broken but the staff were onto it very quickly and even washed our dishes before it was fixed! Would stay again.

Such a beautiful, grand, glamourous hotel with incredibly views over the Bay of Naples and an impossible to beat location in town.The staff are exactly what you'd expect from such an establishment. Unassuming, informed, helpful and friendly. Nothing is a bother and they know everything and anything. Do eat in the restaurant; we had both a la carte and the tasting menu and would highly recommend both. But make sure you're hungry for the tasting menu as in between all of the set courses, you're given plenty of other dishes to try! Can't wait to return.

Lovely laid back, unpretentious restaurant with casual decor. Not the sort of place to get dressed up for but the food was just amazing. We both had steak, which melted in the mouth, plus a mouth watering cold meat selection to start. Service staff courteous, friendly and attentive.

Located on the northern edge of the city by the Villa Borghese, the hotel has great access to the city by virtue of it's complimentary car service that shuttles to and from the Spanish Steps very frequently. Upon arrival, we were offered an upgrade from a Premium room to a Junior Suite, with gorgeous views of the swimming pool. The bed was huge and comfortable and the room spacious with lots of lovely little touches and a lovely ensuite bathroom.Breakfast each morning was a feast in itself and room service was to be recommended. The main restaurant wasn't open so can't comment on that but I'd say the only downside to our stay was the disappointing smaller restaurant. But to be fair, we only ate there as we'd arrived later and didn't head into the city where we had some fantastic food (highly recommend Babette near the Spanish Steps).The staff were faultless and nothing was ever too much trouble. Loved the little touches like use of the bikes to check out the park and free bottles of water by the entrance.We will definitely be back.

We've two young boys and they declared it the best day! They got to sit in a McLaren, a Harrier and wander inside a plethora of aircraft including the mighty Concorde (extra) and the Sultan of Oman's VC10. Us grown ups got to drive a timed simulated lap of the original Brooklands circuit whilst sitting in another McLaren, which was tied for being the highlight along with being driven up Test Hill and along part of the banked circuit by a pro in an old car. Oh and gazing at the restored Wellington that was discovered in Loch Ness by people searching for the monster; I kid you not! The volunteers are just amazing; never boring and never anything less than massively enthusiastic and knowledgeable. We learnt that the silver car we were looking at at one point holds the Brooklands lap record, is still road worthy, spits out flames when it's bump started by 6 people, has a 23litre engine and is worth an eye watering £2m! It's a Napier Railton if you're interested!Forget the cafe and pack a picnic; where else can you eat your ham Sarnie under Concordes pointy nose?! There are so many things to discover and look at and it never gets boring. Get the kids the booklet where they get to spot things and tick them off. There're loads of events on over the year; we went over the Easter hols and it wasn't crowded at all Can't wait to go back !

Jo and Philippe are lovely, welcoming and warm hosts and great cooks to boot! We stayed in the family 'suite', which is two spacious, well furnished, comfy bedrooms (a twin and a double) with a shared shower room, all in their own 'wing' in the house, so nice and private and without fear of the kids being too noisy for other guests!. There was a travel cot for our youngest to use plus a high chair so it made staying all the easier. Lots to do in the area, especially if you're into your wines; can highly recommend the Montbazillac!Wouldn't hesitate to recommend Les Lauriers, especially if you've got kids, and make sure you experience at least one evening meal, you won't be disappointed.

It's in a great location (a short stroll to Covent Garden where we needed to be overnight), is a good price for London and the room we stayed in was a good size. The room was a little warm but it has some temperature control so didn't bother us. Liked the fact that the customary underused hotel bath was dispensed for a large shower instead. Like the free ice and water in the hallway too. Nothing to complain about, would stay again.
BikerBird|0039FA2A9923727673573478F828EFE4|Hotel|London: The Hoxton, Shoreditch|5| “Luxury Budget”|review_10078421|The best hotel I've stayed in in London where prices are normally exploitatively hideous and rooms tiny and noisy. The pluses: spotlessy clean, friendly & helpful staff, great reasonably priced food in the Grille if you want a bigger breakfast (served until a wonderfully 'late' midday at the weekend,) plus lunch or dinner, good links to central London, 2 free bottles of chilled water and milk in the room (along with kettle, tea and coffee), free safe in the room, free newspapers, free internet access, comfortable bed with cosy duvet and squishy pillows, huge windows letting in loads of light etc etc etc.Also provided in the room is a pocket size fold-out leaflet with local map and loads of impartial recommendations about stuff to do, places to go, bars, restuarants, clubs, galleries, all within a one mile radius.The negatives: can't actually think of any!

BikerBird|0039FA2A9923727673573478F828EFE4|Hotel|Ayia Napa: Napa Plaza Hotel|5| “What a fantastic hotel”|review_8016430|This surely has to be the best hotel in Ayia Napa when you take into account location, staff and facilities and everyone we spoke to was really enjoying their stay.The hotel is very contemporary but not in a pretentious manner. It's also a bit of a tardis in that you enter through an archway off the road but don't initially realise that the nightclub entrance (underground), bakery/cafe, Pepper Bar (great drinking venue) and El Chihuaua mexican restaurant (great food and offers a 15% discount to hotel residents) along the front are all part of it.We booked a superior room with pool view which protected us a little from the noise of the bar (the music tends to quieten down by 1pm anyway). A guy we got talking to had a room facing the road (above the Pepper bar) and he said he needed his earplugs until the music was turned down but don't let that put you off! Our room was an adequate size and very tastefully decorated. Would have to agree with a previous poster that the aircon could do with being a bit more powerful. We heard some comments from guests not happy with the room size but at the end of the day, you only really shower and sleep in the room...Breakfast offers a vast array of foods (cereals, toast, cooked, continental, fruit) and the lunch menu is recommended with dishes from salads to sandwiches to burgers. If you want a change at lunch (or are having a late breakfast!), there's a myriad of restaurants, cafe's and fast-food joints right outside the hotel. The staff are just lovely; nothing ever seems too much bother and everything's done with a smile.A plus point for those without children is that the hotel don't allow children to stay during peak months.For the more actively-minded, there is an activity programme of sorts during the day including water aerobics at 11am, the very entertaining water-polo at 3pm plus tennis, football etc. There's also an on-site spa with gym (why would you?!), and beauty salon plus a handy shop selling newspapers, magazines, suncream etc.The location is a high point. The square where all the clubs are located is a 5 min walk up the hill so just far away enough to not be affected by noise but near enough if it's what you want. There are some great restuarants right on the hotel door step. Aside from the on-site mexican, our favourites were Clarabel over the road (flambe steak) and Fiji above it (seemed to be a fusion of Polynesian and south-east Asian). And don't our stomachs know it!There was a mix of people staying from 20's up to 60's. Would say the majority of guests there during our stay (mid to late June) were in their late 20's to 40's; I would imagine that the the hotel prices don't make it an attractive proposition for the younger market so has less of a frenzied atmosphere about it.A previous poster said that if you're not a clubber, don't go to Ayia Napa and I would have to disagree. We're not, so didn't go near the square (other than to walk through just out of curiousity) and still had a fantastic holiday.Would definitely stay again.
BikerBird|0039FA2A9923727673573478F828EFE4|Hotel|Venice: Hotel do Pozzi|4| “Pretty good overall and great location”|review_6016782|We stayed in Venice on the last stop of our wedding and honeymoon trip and Do Pozzi was our least favourite hotel of the trip. To be fair though, the hotel we stayed in in Sorrento was amazing so no hotel was really going to match it!The downside was the room itself which was shabby and tired and in dire need of rennovation. Also, everyones door seemed to stick on opening and closing resulting in some door slamming up and down the corridor! But that's the negatives over with.It's a great location for St Mark's and the thousands of shops and restaurants. Water taxi, gondola and Vaporetto stops all very close by. The staff are friendly and helpful and our room was always cleaned with bed made whilst we were at breakfast (which itself was good).
BikerBird|0039FA2A9923727673573478F828EFE4|Hotel|Rome: Fontana Hotel|4| “Great location and views!”|review_6016760|The Fontana doesn't look like much from the outside but don't let that put you off. The hotel and rooms may be small (space is a premium in cities like Rome) but the place is spotless and the staff are friendly and helpful (we got very detailed instructions on where to buy tickets for football and then find the Stadio Olimipco via foot, Metro and buses from reception).With cities such as Rome where there's so much to see and do, all you're really doing is showering and sleeping in your room and the Fontana is better than most city centres hotels I've stayed in.Undoubtedly, the best thing about the hotel is it's fairly central location as everything is walkable from it (Rome is a fairly compact city). Our room was on the third floor with a Trevi Fountain view which was just breathtaking. It was noisy with the window open due to the constant crowds outside (even at 11pm in Oct it was packed outside), but there was aircon in our room so no need to have the window open other than to take in the view and crowds. With the window closed, all we could hear was the fountain but I'm not so sure about rooms on lower floors and whether you'd hear the crowds.The were two downsides to our room but these were fairly minor to us. Our 3rd floor room was below the breakfast room so from around 7/8am we could just make out chairs scraping across the floor. There was also a large sliding connecting door to the next room which literally took up a third of the wallspace; this did mean that we could hear our neighbours loud and clear (nothing that banging on the wall didn't sort out!).Breakfast on the top floor was delicious with a good range of cereals, breads, fruits, meats and so on. The 2 ladies serving breakfast were lovely. From our observations, generally if you make an effort to smile and say hello in the local language, which isn't hard, your efforts will be rewarded. Please be aware of pick-pockets in Rome. I'd been warned by relatives that had purses stolen at a Metro station a few years ago, so was extra vigilent with an over the body zipped up bag, but still almost got mine pinched at The Forum (zip open and hand hovering over purse). BE CAREFUL!
BikerBird|0039FA2A9923727673573478F828EFE4|Hotel|Sorrento: Hotel Bristol|5| “Did not want to leave”|review_6013524|We spent a week at the Bristol in early October for our Sorrento wedding and start of our honeymoon. The great reviews are all true, this hotel is fantastic. The staff and service are exceptional and friendly; nothing was ever too much trouble.We stayed in junior suite room 913 which has breathtaking views (slightly smaller terrace than 914 tho). We could open the electric shutters on the outside of the doors and windows from a button by our bed. Once the shutters were up, the view from the bed was blue sky and Vesuvius. And you can't complain about sitting in a hot tub on your terrace drinking champagne whilst surveying the Bay of Naples. The rooms were cleaned every day (we had our towels changed twice a day!) and the beds turned down during the evening.We ate out in Sorrento whilst there, as well as on honeymoon in Rome and Venice and the Bristol served some of the best food we ate over the trip. On our last morning the staff asked us to sign the guest book and of the reviews we read in it, there was not one bad remark.We visited hotels that our wedding guests were staying and we definitely had the best deal. The Bristol may not be the swankiest, plushest hotel, or right in town (only 10 min walk or take the bus which stops right outside) but you can't beat the staff, the service and the fact that it's not slap bang in the middle of a fairly busy town. Can't wait to go back again.

The hotel is gorgeous, romantic and cosy in a great central location with good-sized, elegantly furnished rooms. Breakfast is fantastic with a great selection of fruits, cereals, pancakes, meats and the chocolate fountain and champagne which are a decadent must!The staff are friendly, professional and helpful and can recommend some great restaurants.The only niggle we had was the noise from cars driving over the cobbled road in the morning although thankfully there wasn't much traffic. If you're coming to Bruges for the Christmas markets, don't bother as there are only a handful of stalls and most aren't selling traditional crafts. If you're coming for chocolate and a quiet break in a beautiful town with great restaurants, then Bruges is your place!Will be back to stay again.

Decided to try it for the first time. The fries came with melted cheese on top. This was not as good as it looked and the cheese tasted more artificial. The fries were ok. In regards to the sub, the chicken was tender and nice but the combination of the bread, chicken and sauce just really didn't go together. Most likely wouldn't return here again.

Upon arrival we were seated promptly and informed by the waitress what the soup of the day was. The ambience of the restaurant is just amazing and it is clear that a lot of attention to detail has been put into the restaurant. Unfortunately, as we had already eaten we only came for dessert but would definitely try the main courses next time. The range of cheesecakes is large and was difficult to choose. I opted for the mango and lime cheesecake. This is amazing! What I didn't realise is that the biscuit base of the cheesecake has coconut inside so adds to the crunch! Great place to go and unwind.

The deal consisted of buy one main get another for free. After asking the polite staff what was included in the deal, he informed us that we could pick, for example a main curry dish and then pick one main grilled tandoori dish such as seekh kebabs. They further supplied us with a variety of poppadoms with different chutneys and refilled this also when we ran out which was a great gesture. We initially had wanted to be seated outside on the balcony of the restaurant to face the marina where all the yachts were situated but due to the weather most probably (as we were there in August and it is extremely hot) there was no seating arrangements outside. Nevertheless, the staff were kind enough to allow us and other diners from different tables to take a walk outside on their balcony and take pictures. Overall, the food was great and arrived hot and quickly. Would definitely go again and their butter chicken was lovely.

The airport is definitely 5 star worthy. From the hotel staff taking our bags up to the room to the amazing room service! The restaurant located inside the hotel is also amazing with tuna salad stuffed crossiants, fries and a flourless chocolate cake with ice cream. They have a free shuttle that takes you to and from the airport which is only a matter of minutes away from the hotel anyways. Would be more than happy to stay here again.

We ordered this to our hotel through an app known as foodpanda. Was quick and very convenient. In regards to the food, we ordered a box containing chicken wings and buffalo fries amongst other sides. All came with honey mustard sauce which has been the best honey mustard sauce I have ever tried till date! Chicken wings come with plastic gloves to keep the fingers clean from the sauce soaked wings!! Will always go back each time I go to Singapore! This is a must!

Quick and easy way to access sentosa island and then universal studios onwards. The studios itself is great with plenty of rides (although many of which are aimed towards children). A lot of the main bigger rides had long waiting times (some even having waiting times up to 90 minutes!). Few places to eat inside as well as some souvenir/gift shops. Overall, a good day out as there are plenty of other things to also do on sentosa island including the beaches. Just be wary with the weather as if there are thunderstorms, we were advised that the studios may be closed.

I ordered for delivery and (of course) it came an hour later. We asked for BBQ chicken wings and got given hot wings instead. Called up the place and the owner reassured me that we would be receiving the BBQ wings too. Of course, they took another hour to deliver two boxes of wings. By this time, we had all finished our food. The delivery man approached and handed us the food and demanded for the hot wings to be given back to him. After explaining that we had already eaten them since the owner on the phone said not to worry and not once mentioned to give them back, the delivery man decided to question as to why we ate them...perhaps because we were starving and not our fault you messed up our order?! It is regular custom everywhere I have eaten if they give you something wrong, restaurants will make up for it. However, this delivery man was so rude to the point where he said he wanted money for the hot wings to which I replied NO! He said we were unfair for eating the hot wings lol. Why weren't we told over the phone not to eat the wings or if we did, we would have to pay for them? What is more concerning is that, was he planning on taking them back to sell them onto another customer? Was he wanting to eat them himself? Why shout at us if it's your fault for messing up an order? After all this, he rudely walked off. What an idiot...will definitely not be coming back here ever again. Poor customer service and clear lack of respect.

Great place to eat and service was fantastic. Food was at a great standard and we weren't made to wait around in terms of the food arrival time. In regards to portion sizes of the food, they were very generous. We also didn't realise that they happened to give you free bread and dips to start your meal off with! Overall, great experience, staff are polite and would definitely recommend on coming back here! Didn't think you could find a place like this in luton!
raaaziz|F0C233FEA7324EA242EC3D50F59B2C49|Restaurant|Luton: Khybers House Luton|1| “Bunch of liars!”|review_237503586|This place claims to sell afghan food but doesn't sell anything of the sort. Just seems like a run down Pakistani restaurant and that too, in a very unhygienic environment. Service was very poor, we weren't even served straight away. We were made to stand at the front door for ages whilst many of the workers walked past without even saying a word. Once they sat us down, our menus were given and no one seemed to return for a good while. Again, workers walking past us, making eye contact, yet no one bothered to take our order. Finally I asked someone to come over and how dumbfounded he was, asking if our order had already been taken. He most definitely knew that we had been waiting to place our order. After ordering (only one dish and a roti), the waiter didn't even bother to give the, somewhat, sticky note that he wrote our order on to the cooks (how professional). After spending a good while finding the note our food began to be cooked about half an hour later. Bearing in mind, this was only ONE dish. What was worse was the fact that they had a card machine (which another customer pointed out) but apparently were only accepting cash. I really wish they had said this at the door. So this required me to run to the nearest cash machine to withdraw money and finally upon my return the food was at our table. However, it was most definitely cold. After eating the food, we weren't given a bill just the price on the calculator. Don't know what that was about. Overall, a really bad experience, rude staff, the staff (all men) seem to look down on you if you're women. They are more concerned with getting orders ready for their male customers. This was evident as everyone was served before us. One staff member also was hassling my friend, asking her if the food was good. Of course the food wasn't good, hence the lack of emotion upon our faces. I felt as if they were taking the mick. Will never ever be back here in my whole life. And they should definitely be closed down for false advertising as this had nothing to do with afghan food. Waste of my time and money. Food was not even worth waiting for. If I could give no stars I would.
raaaziz|F0C233FEA7324EA242EC3D50F59B2C49|Attractions|Beijing: Dashilan|3| “Interesting place”|review_231452674|Was invited out to Dashilan by a friend who lives in Beijing locally. We personally found that it was a bit of a journey from our hotel and cost around 80 yuan to get there by taxi. However, I would probably recommend getting the subway here instead, as it would be cheaper. Nevertheless, very interesting place and well worth a visit if you get a chance. Majority of the places that surrounded our hotel were more modern Beijing. Whereas, Dashilan was more traditional Beijing. Didn't get to spend much time here but from what I saw, many shops are situated throughout, of which, have competitive prices in comparison to the oh so famous silk market in Beijing. However, I personally found that bargaining here was more difficult than in the silk market. Overall, great place to visit for a more traditional look upon Beijing.
raaaziz|F0C233FEA7324EA242EC3D50F59B2C49|Restaurant|Luton: Cookies & Cream|1| “Terrible!”|review_230934972|Poor customer service from the start! We walked in (this not being our first time we had come so we knew the drill) and the staff seemed to walk past us as if they had not even acknowledged the fact that we were standing there. Fair enough, we thought perhaps they are busy. We went and sat down at a table (which hadn't been cleaned but was the only suitable table available) and one member of staff said he would bring the menus over and clean the table up. We were then asked to get up and move to another table that had recently become available which was a tiny little table in the corner to give room to a few teenagers even though we were there first and had sat down first. Still, they were keen on serving them first and forgot to even give us menus when we sat at the other table, so we ended up walking out. Not that they probably noticed. In the past their food has not been worth the money it is priced at. Not brilliant desserts. The nandos on the floor down below seems to do better desserts than this place. On top of that, I am convinced that some of their desserts are just bought from costco or somewhere similar. Had a cheesecake here once, was absolutely terrible! Never again! Their whipped cream also tends to taste out of date and warm! Wouldn't recommend this place!

The time that me and a friend went was during summer, partially midday. Therefore, majority of the animals were asleep and not active! Not that I blame them because of the scorching heat! The ticket included entrance to the aquarium but was completely packed out with people that was impossible to really enjoy the area so we left. The zoo in general is situated on a large piece of land and does make for a good walk around the place. There are many stalls offering water and snacks scattered around the place which is definitely required due to the high temperatures! Animals should have been in a better condition and seemed a little bit malnourished. Doesn't help that people are constantly banging on the side of the cages and what not to get the animals attention. Not a nice environment in that sense. Nevertheless, we managed to do near enough the whole zoo in about 2 hours or so. Personally, this would not make for a good day visit. I would spend my time elsewhere if possible. Only would come here if there was nothing else to do!

Very reasonable pricing compared to other places I have visited. For two people, can easily eat for around £6 per head. The quality of the food is amazing! Have no complaints really!

The staff are very polite and we were served within minutes of ordering our food! Presentation and quality of food was good. Generous portion sizes too. I wish that they had only placed it in more central London or somewhere similar as it seems to be of a much higher standard than the rest of Southall! The guy serving us provided us with drinks without us even having to ask him and spoke to us afterwards asking if the food was good which was great! Would definitely come back here and would definitely recommend! Fantastic! Would love to see them branch out to other areas too. Decor was nice and modern.

We were served promptly and food came out on time. They seemed to have given us prawn crackers alongside two pots of chutney with salad, which was a bit strange but most likely to do with the fact that they do Chinese and Pakistani food. Not going to lie but the salad seemed like it had been there for days! Other than that, the Lahori hareesa was amazing and so was the sweet and sour chicken. However, after visiting China in the past, you can definitely tell TKC's Chinese is not up to scratch. Would come here again for the Pakistani food though!

After eating a meal, which seemed ok at the time, I came home suffering from food poisoning!! Service was also poor and it took a while to get the waiters attention to order in the first place. Atmosphere is ok, not too loud but is quite cramped in terms of the table arrangements. Although it is a cheap option (with their £10.95 set meal) would not come back here again due to how sick it made me feel!!! Never again!!

Please be aware and cautious with children!! Other than the slight mishap, food was lovely!

First visit was somewhere around Q1 of 2017.I personally really like this hotel because it is inside RWS Sentosa that has a lot of things and close to where my sister lives. The staffs are friendly and professional, service was fast and the rooms we have stayed were clean. They let us choose the type of bed as well as care to ask if we want to stay in smoking or nonsmoking room. You just need to walk a little if you want to visit casino, then they also have michelin-stared Italian restaurant called Fratelli next to their lobby. One thing they could improve would be the gym as some equipments were already broken and the lighting was too dark. Overall, very nice, I would recommend my friends to stay here.

Daryl S|2B4792D4B1CBA413781AD99C54602F01|Hotel|Beijing: Swissotel Beijing Hong Kong Macau Center|2| “You get what you pay for - Definitely not 5*”|review_507491026|Graphically disappointed with this hotel for a number of key reasons:- Dirty bathroom with black mildew between some of the tiles.- Towels were worn and frayed and at least three had holes in them.- Telephone point broken away from the wall in the room- Awkward entrance to the hotel for walkers.- Many staff behind the desk struggled with english and were not patient enough to try to listen when we spoke in mandarin. (I only make this criticism as it is a 5* hotel claiming to cater to an international audience, thus some language skills on the front-desk is to be expected)This hotel has a few saving graces in the shape of the assistant manager and two members of staff on the front desk who were basically mopping up the bad work of everyone else. They were friendly, helpful and patient and made the stay much more bearable by helping us to get many things done.This hotel lacks the finesse of even a 3* hotel, even the artwork in the lobby is looking shabby and if you cast your eyes upwards to the skylight you will see the accumulated dirt and grime.The shop within the hotel on the ground floor is frequently shut irrespective of what the opening hours on the door say forcing you to leave the hotel to go to 7/11 when a random item was needed.Very disappointed with this, even with a cheap room price as you will find in high end hotels in certain parts of the world like Macau, I expected much more from this hotel to warrant its 5* rating. I wish in hindsight I had more supporting images.

In truth all you see are empty buildings through a binocular that you pay for while listening to music blaring through the speakers.Security/military theatre at its finest and all a bit pointless.

The walls in the area are plastered with posters advising where you cannot take pictures and constantly telling you to stay quiet. I understand this is due to the fact that people live and work here but then there are stalls exploiting the tourists who are playing music out loud to attract people.

No daytime fireworks, no water acrobatics on jet skis or anything, just really bad sound quality while Mickey, Minnie, Aladdin, Jasmine and the Snow white couple doing a dance.Really boring, they did not even get applause as the boat drifted away at the end cos it was so lame.The park is okay considering the price for a decent day out but not really up to the standard of disney that I was expecting.

There are many beautiful natural areas to visit in Tokyo and Japan far more impressive than this. This is more like a park than a national garden.

A lovely temple and great area to wander around.

Try to get there before 4 to ensure that you will be able to make use of the observatory and if you are tired, don't miss the last ropeway down.

Daryl S|2B4792D4B1CBA413781AD99C54602F01|Attractions|Nara: Nara Park|4| “A few tips to enjoy this thoroughly”|review_507416504|This is what you came to Nara for. To avoid hustle and bustle and overly aggressive deer be sure to actually walk into the park fully and perhaps to a temple. The majority of tourists crowd the main entrances to the park and buy food and immediately go deer crazy leading to the more brazen deer ganging up and harassing people and it generally being harder to get nice pictures.This is a very large and beautiful park with many magnificent temples. There are many water features and quiet paths where you can enjoy your time without being hassled and still get some class interaction with the friendly deer.Be wary of the males and their propensity to bite your bags or clothing. Make sure children know what they are doing before they annoy an animal with antlers levelled at their face.

The food is average though it is interesting in concept. As most people have said that they would not go again, I would advise not going in the first place. There are plenty of lovely and quirky cafes in Japan with good food and no cover charge or time limit.

The roof top pool is small and showing signs of wear and tear, many of the mosaic tiles are missing - very noticeable , did find a glass tile mosaic loose on the floor and passed on to staff at bar. Bathroom silicone in shower has signs of mold - not the nicest to look at. The lift lobby level 4 some of the parquetry floor was splitting and staring to lift - could be a hazard. Complimentary mini bar with soft drinks , water and juice - nice touchBreakfast buffet was very good ,however Sunday morning we did have to get in a queue to be seated - suggest maybe offering guest waiting tea or coffee.The best part of the hotel is it style but not sure if this is enough

I believe the hotel was re-badge a few years ago. So the old buildings and hotel bones are still there.We had a junior suite on the ground floor of the tranquility wing - great size room, two flat screens tv's, sofa , two wardrobes, Illy Coffee machine and pods and decent sized bathroom.The room just seemed a bit worn - by the mini bar the wall paper was torn and hanging off slightly and the floor was badly marked. The bathroom you could see what was original from the previous hotel - the bath , the basin and taps . In attempt to modernize it looks like the shower and toilet are new with a rain bowed styled tiled mosaic floor.When a room is let say not cheap , I expect a certain cleanliness standard - I shouldn't be looking down at mold over the silicone of the glassed shower - it wasn't good - it needs to be cut out and replaced .The ceiling above the shower also had some cracks and bubbles and more mold spores. We did have a few issue in the bathroom like a blocked shower and leaking taps - which they did fix for us that day . The repaired spindle was put in back to front but still worked.The buffet in Kwee Zeen was good , a different variety of foods for breakfast between each day would be good suggestion.The pool area is large and easy to get a sun bed - not so easy to get a drink. The staff seemed to be very under staffed , every time we ordered we were told there would be a wait.The last drinks we got took over 45mins - they did offer us a free drink in return but the pool area didn't appear to be that busy. Some extra staff or more efficient staff might help - more drinks they get out more money in there pockets.The front of house people were fantastic - so friendly Don't think I'll be rushing back

Just standard Ausi cafe food - looks like it would fit in perfectly in Cottesloe or Claremont - your over priced sour dough bread and wheat grass type of thing .I wouldn't bother with the waiting list to try and get a table inside you will end up having to sitting outside in the heat for around 20mins. Go next door to Boss Man and max out on a burger ,

But the food was average at best - sounds harsh but you are paying for style over substance .Prawn ravioli for starters it was ok looked better than it tasted - the pasta was way too thick to be a classic ravioli .We also had some type of chicken kimchi as well - which I though was really bad it had a burnt chilli flavour throughout and then I had two bits of chicken which I had to spit out - gristle uuhhh .Waiter came and asked what I thought and I told him , maybe the English got lost in translation.Squid ink rice and crispy squid for main was ok and followed with beef shin . The meat was like mush with no texture at all and had quite a bit of sinew/fat as well. The flavour was so strong and overpowering we didn't eat any of it .Price for the meal with 2 beers , a wine , barcadi & juice was $135 AUS . Not to sure why it rates so high , maybe it was an off night , would not recommend for taste but if you want to look good and been seen sure .

We spend around 25k for 80 pax, they include balloons, cake, souvenir and invitation ( which i didn't use ). so i rate is Just Good. If i have time to look for another place i will choose other, but if u want to have a hassle free reception, this place is good. They have additional fee for the balloon set up, and change color of the table cloth. And one more thing. I think they gave less if you take out the remaining food that didn't serve to the guess. So better let them serve all the food, then they will wrap it in front of you.

We are booked by a travel agency so i am not aware what will be the cost of it per night.We have a great time staying at this place.It's clean and accessible to the beach, thou it's very far walking to D'Mall, i think it's a good excuse to have a good exercise to walk and explore Boracay. For the swimming pool, i just don't know if there is other pool, but the pool that we've seen is very small and we didn't enjoy it because it think it's better for the kids to swim on.For me they have a good staff, anything you ask for them, they provide it immediately. For the food, I think it's better than other hotel offer for free breakfast. because when i went to Boracay for the 2nd time. I realize, it's better staying at La Carmela than the other hotel that i even can't remember the name because i am really disappointed with it. So i prefer going back to La Carmela than looking for another cheap hotel that you will be disappointed with.

Hats off to Mr Gaudi for thinking of a structure so huge and putting in to paper so much in detail that future architects found it easy enough to continue the structure. Every inch of the enormous structure speaks in depth about the creativity of Gaudi. It's more of an experience than a sight. Truly it must be experienced to be believed. All those who visit must spend atleast two hours inside this place. Buy the ticket, it's worth the money and all a donation for the continued building of this place. A must see attraction and a possible 8th wonder of the world.

Nice facilities and the room too was very very nice. The breakfast can improve a little. The only problem is that it is a little outside the tourist area. So you have to take a 30 min bus drive everytime you want to visit anyplace in the city. Otherwise it's a v good hotel. Definitely worth the money. The staff is also v v cooperative.

It has some good architecture and has a lot of busy shops and restaurants all around it. With the retiro park just around the corner, you can always plan to have a glimpse of this and have a Kodak moment in front.

You find it well maintained and has a few good view points. The entry is also free. If you want to relax for a few hours away from the fast paced streets of the city, the place does offer a good serene experience, but not much to see or do here apart from that.
Ravi L|4DB8BF670698144CE41893B17295712D|Attractions|Madrid: Queen Sofia Arts Center (Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia)|3| “Not upto my expectations ”|review_377716859|To be honest this museum is huge and has a lot of paintings depicting different time zones. It even has a few Picasso's. The museum has most of its collection from Spanish artists. In my opinion though, the Prado is much better value for money and I felt that the €10 charged by the museum is slightly overpriced. You can rather do this during 6 to 8 pm when entrance is free.

This is one of the great palace of Spain and I was totally amazed by the grandeur of this palace. The lush green gardens surrounding the palace elevate the aura of this place to a different zone altogether. The rooms are simply superb and remind us of the lavish life of the royal family in those days. In short the palace in it self is an amazing place to experience. The problem here is only one. It has an entrance fee of €20. Undoubtedly, it is totally justified. When I went there I was informed that it is free between 6 and 8 pm. So I waited as it was close to 6. However, once inside I was told that it was free only for European and American citizens. I could not fathom as to how a government could discriminate so harshly on the basis of the nationality of a person. It was terrible to say the least. This is the only reason for this poor rating. Do visit the palace if you are in Madrid. It's a nice place to be.
Ravi L|4DB8BF670698144CE41893B17295712D|Attractions|Madrid: Stadio Santiago Bernabeu|5| “An awesome experience ”|review_377712519|I obviously cannot say or write anything which has not already been said or written hundreds or thousands of time before for this great place. It's a huge stadium with a classical tour of the rich heritage of Real Madrid Football club. The wonderful way in which one gets to see the museum, the trophy cabinet, the pitch, the stands, the dressing room etc is truly spectacular. At €19 per visit, it may be a touch expensive but definitely worth it. A must visit place for any one visiting Madrid. We were here for over two hours and never noticed the time slipping by.

It's an endless park with a lake inside it. There are numerous fountains and statues which one can't miss. The park is so picturesque that you can just go on clicking. It is free to enter the park as well and it is very well connected by public transport too. You can easily spend a few hours in the serene shades of the park. At the same time you can also enjoy some breath taking architecture in some of the most amazing statues inside the park. Do visit this place when in Madrid.
Ravi L|4DB8BF670698144CE41893B17295712D|Attractions|Madrid: Prado National Museum|5| “If you are an art lover, then this is a gold mine.”|review_375517225|When you visit the Prado make sure you have a looooooot of time. If you go in without ample time it is an insult to the endless galleries of the treasures of art that are housed here. The paintings are a brilliant depiction of the Spanish history through the ages. It may not have a Monet or a Van Gogh or a Da Vinci but it has the best of Spain and few paintings provide a real insight into the history and the artistic intelligence of the artists from those periods. A gem of a museum. Truly the best of Spain. It has a fee of approx €10. If you do not want to spend that you can visit it during 6 pm to 8pm during which time I was told that it is free to enter into the museum. A definite must see.

For me its like the heart of this city. The place is so lively in the evening with so many local artists performing street shows and people buzzing all over. The cafes at every nook and corner of the square make it even more appeasing. This is also the place where you can get a metro, a bus, a train, a hop on hop off ride or a taxi. So you can just imagine the kind of connectivity this place has. It has beautiful fountain, a few statue and many many many artists all the time. Must see place.
Ravi L|4DB8BF670698144CE41893B17295712D|Hotel|Madrid: Petit Palace Puerta Del Sol|4| “An excellent place and a marvellous location”|review_375511015|Firstly the hotel is excellent value for money and has all facilities that one would expect . The biggest advantage of this hotel though is its location. All the major tourist spots are within a 2 km radius from the hotel. In fact you can walk down to every single one of them. Wonderful hotel and the staff too is very very cooperative. The complimentary break fast that they provide is also very elaborate and even a vegetarian like me found substantial things to fill myself with. The only reason for a missing star is the lack of a restaurant and probably a kettle in the room. Otherwise its perfect.

Such has been the delicacy of the flavours and the temptation of the aroma of the food here that I have often ended up eating twice my appetite.

The rooms too can improve a lot as the price they charge does not justify the same.

The hotel is quite old and although they have tried to update the interior it didn't come out well. The bathroom tiles are broken as the subflooring is weak, the decoration in the rooms is poor, fabrics and floors stained, crazy wiring for tv and lights. If you order room service expect a refusal or to be advised of a penalty charge instead of a "thank you". Bell service is hit and miss with the arriving being very helpful and the departing being horrible. Overall they are not service oriented and it shows from the top down. The exception is reception where there were nothing but smiles. Recommended to avoid this hotel unless you have no other choice.

GSBennett|7D96C416CCF200B34BC29464A4E8BA3A|Hotel|Karon: Centara Grand Beach Resort Phuket|2| “Poor design badly executed”|review_154597014|We stayed in two very expensive rooms with a pool on an upper floor. The pool vanished into the sunset and dangerously so as our kids endlessly wanted to look over the unguarded edge of the pool that dropped 30 feet to the concrete below. Views were exceptional and frightening. Kids had a great time in the main swimming pool and water slides. The hotel was dirty everywhere, our linens and towels were dirty Pool towels were dirty, and the room was dirty. Service at the two hotel restaurants could only be scored in negative points. At one dinner with friends (total of 8 people at the table), our meals never arrived until it was time to close for the night and the waiter offered not charge for the dinner we didn't eat! Other meals were poor in quality and service. Most of the restaurant staff could not understand English, Chinese, German, or Spanish (as far as asking for an egg "over easy".) Our complaints to managers (which did speak English) were not answered with any actions and for the most part ignored (except for the Front Office Manager which didn't offer any compensation and only explained how well the hotel had been doing in the past). Maybe they were having a bad week due to the massive flood of tourists during the Chinese new year, or maybe it is always that bad, but we will never go back to find out.Recommendation is to avoid this hotel unless everything else is full.

The main tank is just amazing, huge and boasting many species of aquatic wildlife. You could spend hours sitting there watching it all.There is a historical maritime museum at the entry of the aquarium which will be undergoing refurbishment (April 2017) which is well worth the visit as well.
Pam O|4B60F2772D9956A6B551E0F4862872B8|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|5| “best theme park!! ”|review_476740562|If you've never been to Singapore, make sure you take a day out to visit Sentosa Island, especially Universal Studios. You can buy discounted tickets through travel websites like GoVoyagin, there are special bundle ticket options available to visit multiple attractions on Sentosa & maximise your fun; this visit we purchased a double for Universal Studios & S.E.A. Aquarium. The entrances are directly across from one another, both are awesome attractions & there is something for everyone. The instructions to redeem the tickets on the confirmation email were perfect, but when we tried to print our passes at the Universal Studios self help kiosk the printers weren't working so to avoid that I recommend going directly to Guest Services (which for USS is hidden directly behind the yellow ticket boxes where general public line up) and they will print your tickets for you and all is good. Pass outs are available any time the attractions are open, so what we do if the heat & the wait lines to go on rides becomes too much, is escape to the Aquarium & into the air con to wind down & enjoy watching the marine life in the huge aquarium. I recommend for Universal Studios to either turn up right on 10am, or wait until after 1pm (which still gives you 6 hours) if you want to avoid long wait lines. Anyway this bundle is great value for money, we searched for many offers and this one was good value, easy and undeniably the best combo pick for Sentosa.Also, check the website for any ride closures. And if you want to save cash on the food offerings at USS, there are cheaper food outlets like macdonalds, texas chicken & many different asian diners & restaurants outside the park in rwsentosa.
