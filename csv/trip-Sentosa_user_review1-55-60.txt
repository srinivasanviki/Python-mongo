The fusion between Asian and American is just perfect beside the standard American style burgers that you can get here. You can have A-Bomb burger which was spicy but taste fantastic. The Landmine burger is a burger which has very cool combination of ingredients. To top it off, the service from the staff is friendly and they even adviced us on the spot to visit in Bali.

Certainly there are a lot of food to experience. We ordered the satay which was delicious. My wife ordered their local noodle which was very good and our children had some toasts. A good mix of food choices at a very cheap price. We are glad we took the effort to come.

It can be tiring and there are many rides / adventures that we tried which adds to an overall exciting time.

When the queues have a waiting time of 40 minutes + for a ride you will thank me for this advice. We simply showed the pass at the gate and were promptly shown the pathway up to the front of the queue. We went during the week and not school holidays and it was still busy. Great attractions - especially the Transformers 3D. Lockers are free for the rides where you are not allowed to take bags etc. Well run and very clean. Food was well priced as were the drinks. You can book on line and save but be sure of the day that you want to attend.

Not in the heart of the city but a quieter area. Arrived early so suite was still being readied. No hassles. Leave your bags here and hop on our courtesy bus to have a look around the city. Returned to be shown our suite - complete with full kitchen, bedroom, best bathroom we have seen, lounge area and decent desk for laptop etc plus a laundry complete with washer/dryer. Staff were excellent and extremely helpful. Suite was spotless and a lovely bowl of fresh fruit and bottled water was complimentary as was WiFi and cable. We made good use of their shuttle bus which had 2 different runs around the city on an hourly basis. The placement of the building make it only a 5 minute walk from one of the HiPPO drop off points. (hint: a 2 day pass is recommended). Their recreational facilities on the 6th floor were fantastic with an almost Olympic sized pool, well provisioned gym and outdoor deck area for children (with play equipment), sauna/steam room and spa. Breakfast was part of our stay and this was a full breakfast. On the day of our departure we were allowed to checkout at 2pm with no additional cost (our plane didn't leave until 8.50pm.) Once again, they were extremely helpful in making this time enjoyable and the less stressful we have experienced in our travels. Top marks to all at this accommodation.

Wonderful place for families. Boardwalk with ample seating, bbq facilities, playground and protected patrolled beach area. Cafes and restaurants overlook this precinct.

So since I had no great expectations on the hotel, the stay was good. Only the wifi was weak and the rooms didn't have much plug points.The greatest thing about this hotel is that it is in the heart of the town and everything is close by.

For the sake of double glazing this problem could have been solved. The area where the apartment are located is dead and I had to walk nearly a kilometer to get some food. A lot of the buildings in the area are vacant and shabby looking. Free wifi is available and a small kitchenette is in the room. The staff were friendly and the room clean and fresh. I would probably stay at the other Quest that is located approx 600m down the street next time so I could get a good sleep.

That was a mistake. After paying $5 for white toast it came out as warm bread (must have been in the toaster for 30 seconds) and then put the slices under my sqash ball textured poached eggs (asked for soft) the so called toast ended up a soaking mush. Unfortunately I could not eat it. to top it off the coffee I ordered was mediocure. They lost a customer which is unfortunate for them as I was staying at the Quest for six weeks and they do a charge back to the room deal. I also like friendly staff.

It was a pleasure to get eggs and toast how you order them and a good cup of coffee to help wash it down. Dinner meals are also very nice and enjoyable. The staff were friendly and the prices reasonable. In summer it is pleasurable to sit under the umbrellas outside and enjoy drinks. There is an ATM inside if required.

The reason behind this popularity is because the food is so good. The pulled pork and pork ribs would have to be some of the best I have tasted. I have eaten in and had take away. The staff are friendly and the variety of beers and spirits is good. Side vegetables and salads are very flavoursome. Of all the eatery's in Port Adelaide this one is the best. The meat is slow cooked for 18 hours and this makes it so tender. The choices of mustards and dressings are also delightful. Have eaten here several times and will continue to come back.

The only problem with that is that there are no shops etc close by. Breakfast comes with the room and is good to have. Food is limited in this hotel but a restaraunt is available from the Holiday Inn across the road in the same complex. Staff were friendly and the rooms were good. You had a choice of soft or firm pillows and the bed was comfortable. The shower worked very well. Although Wifi is free and advertised as fast it is not fast by all means. Probably one of the slowest wifi connections I have used. This becomes frustrating if you need the internet for business. There is good security of the three hotels (Holiday Inn Express. Holiday Inn & Holiday Inn Suites.) The bar is quite good and there is plenty of chairs/tables to use. I enjoyed my stay and would stay again.

I can't understand the high praise other people have given as I was expecting the best breakfast ever. How disappointing. I ordered poached eggs on toast and got a plate full of water with my eggs and the toast was warmed bread which was as tough as shoe leather. Unfortunately the coffee was not much better. It tasted bitter and burnt. Had to leave most of it behind as I couldn't eat it. Went next door and had Red Rooster.

Great selections of food both Thai and western. The flvours were excellent and the portions were a good size. You pay a little more but get a lot for the price. We had lunch and dinner here and the staff were friendly and the service was good. The only downfall was that the toilets, although clean had an overpowering smell of camphor. This tended to hurt your eyes and throat.Really enjoyed our meals here and is a great place for a change of menu.

The food was not that good and the coffee was just as bad. The meal and coffee was expensive and the service was poor. I suppose it did do something as I couldn't wait to get airline food. Airport venues are expensive throughout the world but aleast in some you get some resemblance of value for money but not here. Some of the most expensive coffee I have drunk. Unfortunately there is not a great range of places to have a decent breakfast in Terminal 2.

Thai, Indian and western foods can be ordered on the same bill as well as drinks. This is located on the banks of the Singapore River at Robertson Quay and has a relaxing atmosphere when eating. .Our group ordered several dishes from each of the restaurants and everyone enjoyed their choices. The Indian food was good and I enjoyed the Thai food. The staff can be a bit obnoxious at times but that was not going to deter us from the delicious food. The drinks menu is very good and the prices are reasonable. The food portions were good and flavoursome. Will still go back to enjoy the food.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Restaurant|Singapore: Hooters|2| “Expensive and rude”|review_484514965|What a disappointing place to visit. Intended to stay for drinks and dinner but the service was so poor and the drinks so expensive we decided to leave after one drink. The staff gave you the impression that we were an annoyance to their day. Everyone felt uncomfortable so we showed our distaste with our feet and tried another venue. I am surprised at the prices and service considering the amount of competition that is around Clarke Quay. Not a good advertisement for Hooters. Will not be going back any day.

An old street stall since 1946, however the food is excellent and the noodles and pandang are some of the best I've had. The price is very cheap and the portions are large. The MeeTon Poe special is really tasty and full of flavours. Our group of 8 had so many different dishes and every one was delicious. Truly local flavours and a great experience.

Friends had other meals which were all good and wholesome. The Guiness and beers added the the meals. The staff were friendly and made sure we were happy with the food. A good change in Thailand.

The hot rock for cooking meat and fish at your desired state is good. Our group chose hot rock meals, salmon, pizza's, garlic prawns and platters. Everyonr thoroughly enjoyed their meals. Drinks were cold and everything was reasonably priced. The atmosphere was good and the staff were friendly. Although the weather was cold and windy outside it was warm and cosy inside. The venue caters for small or large groups of people. Probably the second best place to eat in Rockingham.

Staff are very friendly and look after you very well. There is plenty of room that is spread out upstairs and below. Spent a lot of time here especially on weekends to watch AFL and NRL. Would recommend this venue to anyone. A great meeting place.

The choices off the menu were extensive and reasonably priced. We watched the pizza's being made on a television but the pasta's and meat meals were top quality. The thin crust pizza's were enjoyable. Staff were friendly and the food did not take long to get to the table. Drink prices were also reasonable.

The bars and entertainment centres open, however the hawkers thrive to get you to buy their wares, go to their bar or show and can get annoying sometimes. Overall it is crowded but you feel safe at the same time. There are plenty of bars to choose from and the prices are reasonable. During the day small stalls crop up everywhere to sell T shirts, souveniers and other wares. There are very good restaurants open here with some great food. Wouldn't recommend the night life for kids as they be a bit overwhelmed.

It is within walking distance to Jungceylon shopping centre and Bangla Road. There are many restaurants and shops surrounding the hotel. The rooms are clean and the bed is reasonably comfortable. There is a safe and the shower is good. The price is very good, however it caters for a lot of Russians who are very noisy in the middle of the night. We did have trouble with the fire alarms going off at 2.00am several times. Breakfast is simple but you get eggs, toast, coffee, juices and some asian and european foods. The pool is small but enjoyable, especially during the humid periods. There are many laundry agents in the street outside to get your clothes washed.

The museum has some excellent displays and a record of the history of the railway. This visit is must if you intend to visit Hellfire Pass and its museum as it gives you a great overview of the harships encountered during the building of the railway. The displays record many facts and figures of the operation. There is a small cafe where you can get a cup of coffee free as part of your ticket. The museum is well kept and clean and allows space and time to reflect on the displays.We went to Hellfire Pass for the dawn service on Anzac Day and it truly is a moving experience especially when two survivors from the railway read out the ode. The museum at Hellfire Pass has further information specifically in relation to the pass. A bucket list experience.

I found the artefact and items interesting. It is a shame that more money could not be injected to upgrade the museum as it is a big part of the history of the 2nd World War. Still worth visiting and the entry fee of 40 baht is nothing in the scheme of things.

The ceremony was very moving and the appearance by survivors of the Burma /Thai railway was surreal and gracious. The graves and cemetery is so well manicured it is a pleasure to see the respect bestowed on the heroic deceased. Walking among the graves bring home the sacrifices made by so many during this terrible peroid. Finding the graves of relatives really tears at the heart but makes you respect them more. Worth the visit especially on Anzac Day and Rememberance Day.

It was good to catch up on the hstory of the bridge and the sacrifices made by so many. The markets and restaurants surrounding the bridge are enjoyable to look at and eat in. At times the bridge can get crowded but if you wait awhle and relax watching the surrounding scenery it will give space to move. Worth going to see just for history's sake.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Restaurant|Bangkok: The Manhattan Fish Market - Terminal 21|4| “Tasty Seafood”|review_483078479|The food was good and the staff were friendly. We had 8 different choices of seafood and seafood pasta and everyone enjoyed their fare. The fish was quite tasty and the batter was not overpowering or greasy. The price was reasonable considering the quality of the food. The venue was clean and we did not have to wait too long for the food to appear. A good break from local food. Portions were ample and well presented. An enjoyable meal.

It is a home away from home where up to date live sport can be seen in a good pub atmosphere. There is a good variety of food that is reasonably price and tastes good. The staff are friendly and not overpowering.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Hotel|Bangkok: Salil Hotel Sukhumvit Soi 8|3| “Good location.”|review_483075955|Initially disappointed as we booked for two single beds as we were sharing and the hotel gave our 5 rooms with seperate beds away to someone else. This left our rooms with only one queen size bed in it. They expected two big guys to share the bed until we perservered to get trundle beds put in the room. This left us no room at all in the room and they failed to give us blankets as the airconditioning was freezing. The breakfast was simple with eggs, toast, coffee and friut juice. They do supply a golf cart to transport you to the main road and eatery's. Although their grasp of english was poor the staff were friendly and tried to help us. A cosy hotel with free wifi but does not have a pool.

You get a buffet breakfast but all you get is to stand in front of the orangutans and have a photo taken. The cost does not justify the result. The remaining zoo tour was good with plenty of animals to see and enjoy. The zoo is very tidy and the enclosure are suitable for the animals.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Restaurant|Singapore: Satay By The Bay|4| “Great Satays”|review_483066562|Close to the Garden by the Bay this venue isan ideal place to eat before visiting the gardens at night as it is just a 10 minute walk alongside the barrage lake to the gardens. The satays are great and there are selections of other local food available. The prices are good with satays costing 70c each. I had some crab fried race that was delicious.Choices of drinks including beers and fresh fruit juices are available. Everyone in our group thoroughly enjoyed the food.

It reflects those who gave up their lives for our freedom. Glad to be able to pay my respects to the fallen and as usual the site is kept is an immaculate condition.

The prices were very good especially for the portions that you got. Eight of us had differnt dishes and not one was disappointing as they all were very nice. The staff were friendly and free wifi was available. Most enjoyable meal.

It is a spot to appreciate the history of Singapore and te view the Marina Sands Complex and skyline of the city. It hard to believe that this area was the coast before the reclamation took place. Clarke Quay is just a short walk from here.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Attractions|Singapore: Supertree Grove|5| “The Night Show is a Must”|review_483062865|The light show at night is a spectacular vision. The lights and lasers syncrocised to music are a must see at this great venue. We found it better to lay down on the grass and look up at the show as you got to see more of the show. The colours were mesmerising and the music topped of a great show. Would recommend this to anyone and should be a must see attraction. Catch the other Gardens by the Sea venues at the same time.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Flyer|4| “A True Reflection of the Sights of Singapore”|review_483062147|Have been on the flyer several times and it is one of the best ways to view the skyline of a beautiful city. It gives you a great outlook on how much the city is growing. The clearer the day the better the scenery. The revolution takes approximately 30 minutes but it gives you some of the best photographic opportunities in a relaxing atmosphere.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT)|5| “Fast, Cheap and very Efficient”|review_483061526|The MRT is a fast, cheap and very efficient way to travel in Singapore. By changing lines and utilising buses you can travel anywhere in Singapore without any hassles. The system is clean and easy to follow and caters for tourist attractions as well as the airport. The cost is very cheap and the travel card gives you updated money remining on it. I was surprised by the amount of people that are moved daily with the least amount of fuss or heartache. One of the best public transport systems in the world.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Attractions|Singapore: The Changi Museum|5| “A Reflection of the Past”|review_483060786|We visited here after spending Anzac Day at Hellfire Pass and Kanchanaburi War Cemetry. This is the beginning of the Burma /Thailand railway and the Sandakan Death March. Although the museum is small the information and displays tell a heart breaking story. For ex serving defence members and Singaporeans relatives of troubled locals this is a must visit. It is an eye opener and moving place to visit. Would recommend it to everyone. Our past should never be forgotten.

You get a differnt feeling at night and the atmosphere was surreal. Well well maintained and a great collection of flora. The walk gives you a great relaxing feeling. Make sure you watch the light show after visiting here as it is spectacular.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Restaurant|Singapore: Two Chefs Bar Mexican & Italian|4| “Good variety”|review_483059123|We ate here several times as it was convenient, reasonably priced and the service was good. Catered for kids and a good atmosphere. We had several choice including pizza's, pasta's, steak, mexican and desserts. The grandkids enjoyed the foods and tried different dishes. The staff looked after us every time we visited and ensured our dining was enjoyable. One of the best pizza's Ive had in a long while.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Hotel|Singapore: Value Hotel Thomson|2| “Disappointing and cramped”|review_483058146|Of all the hotels I have stayed in Singapore this would have to be the worst. Had a shared room and it was so small that it bordered on being caustrophobic. There was no place to put suitcases and the gap between the bed was only 800mm. The shower was in the toilet and every time you stood up from the toilet you would hit the shower tap and get soaked. The floor in the bedroom got very slippery and dangerous. The air conditioning did not work and the wifi was poor and did not work in the foyer. Breakfast was served in a restaurant next door and was crowded and the food was of a poor standard. The plus of the visit is that there is a shuttle service to the MRT but only runs for 4 hours, the rooms are cleaned daily but there is still a mould smell in them and for people on a budget the price is reasonable if you can handle small spaces. This place was recommended by our travel agent, however we have advised them of the situation. Definately will not be back.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Restaurant|Sentosa Island: Hard Rock Cafe Sentosa|3| “Expensive food”|review_483056662|I found this cafe expensive and the service below standard. When we went it became quite crowded and the service dropped considerably. The food was average, the drinks post mix and the food expensive for what we ordered. My grandsons and I didn't enjoy it at all. I think you are paying for the decor. Won't be going back.

Aquarium|4| “Very Educational and Soothing Experience”|review_483055883|The grandkids loved the aquarium and found it very educational and interactive. The attraction is clean and the route keeps the traffic flow moving nicely. There are attractions depicting the history of the area and the maritime history. There is a great variety of fish and the main aquarium is huge with a multitude of fish, sharks, rays and corals in it. Very well put together. A great experience.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|4| “Very Family Orientated”|review_483055112|This attraction is very good for family fun. There are many things to see and rides to suit all ages. We spent a good day here and the attractions vary to meet all of a family's requiremnts. Waiting lines when we went were quite good at approximately 20 minutes each ride. We went mid week. The grandkids loved their time here and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and rides. The cost for express lane was quite rich so we decllned, however I believe there was not a benefit on the day we went. Might be benefictial on weekends. Have been here twice and will go back again.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Hotel|Sentosa Island: W Singapore Sentosa Cove|4| “Great Family Hotel”|review_483054075|This hotel is situated adjacent the marina and some good restaurants. The rooms are very clean and the staff are friendly. The pool is massive and great for families. There are shuttle buses that take you to Resort World on Centosa and hotel buses that also take you to Vivo City on the main island. The hotel provides free tickets for the monorail on Centosa Island. The breakfast has a great selection of many foods and eggs cooked to order by their chefs. This hotel is a long way from Singapore City and its attractions. Probably the only downfall is the cost of food and drinks. Nearly $200 for 2 adults and two kids under six for the buffet was over the top. Ideally a room with a balcony overlooking the marina is a better choice when staying here. It is a great place to stay if you are exploring Centosa Island and its attractions.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Restaurant|Singapore: Jumbo Seafood Riverside|3| “Poor cousin to Jumbo Riverwalk”|review_472557078|Went here as Jumbo Riverwalk was too crowded and had a long wait. The service here is not as good as the other Jumbo, however once seated the food did not take long to come out. Although the food lacked some flavour it was alright and the chilli crab was good.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Restaurant|Singapore: Hai Di Lao|5| “Flavoursome food.”|review_472555848|This place is very different and the staff are very friendly and informative. The variety of food and the flavours are excellent. Judging by the crowd the restaurant is very popular as it is packed a lot of the time. The amount of ingredients for the steamboats is expansive and top quality with a great selection of sauces to try. I found the seafood very good and the flavours topped of an excellent meal in a great environment.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Hotel|Singapore: Holiday Inn Singapore Atrium|4| “Still good after refurbishment”|review_472552874|I stay at this hotel often and the staff are still friendly and the rooms comfortable. The view is good and once the new MRT is finished close by it will make the location easier to get to. Free Wifi is available and the bed is comfortable. The choice of pillows is very good. The handy phone in each room is a great addition to use whilst you are in Singapore. The pool is well kept and maintained. There are a lot of restaurants close by and Robinson's Quay is just a short walk across the river. You can also walk to Clark Quay in about 20 minutes.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Restaurant|Port Hedland: Hedland Harbour Cafe|4| “Good variety”|review_472550530|There is a lot of variety for take away or sit down food here. The staff are friendly and choices of foods to satisfy most requirements. The prices are reasonable and you can sit inside or outside for meals. The coffee is good and a sandwiches to order as well as hot meals.
MalDann|F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9|Hotel|Port Hedland: Discovery Parks – Port Hedland|4| “Good long term accommodation”|review_472549407|The chalets are approximately one third the cost of staying at the hotel and the rooms are cleaner and you have more amenties. Stayed here for three weeks and it was good to cook you own food and have a comfortable bed to sleep in. The location is good as you can go fishing or swimming right next door. The staff were friendly and the pool was great in the hot weather. The rooms are cleaned and linen changed weekly but you have a washing machine and kitchen appliances to use if you want to. Will stay here next job I have in Port Hedland.

Although paying an extra 60 SGD even for a 5 years old kid is outrageous !!A very good family time in Sentosa for sure, and most probably the highlight of the trip

I mean, when you know how much they pay the staff in Thailand, I reckon Hilton could hire a few extra hands...When then went for the brunch (while the check-in was still ongoing) which was average at best regarding food quality.The un-requested room upgrade was a nice gesture, although it hardly made it up for the lack of professionalism from the staff...Swimming pool were dirty & full of leaves, even in the morning.Italian restaurant was mediocre, except for the waiters who were brilliant.Next morning, at breakfast, they told me it wasn't included, so I had to pay for it...A blunder from start to finish...

Shelley W|334B30F6411A10FC2529588FA4870581|Hotel|Athens: Athens Status Suites|2| “Not a relaxing place to be....”|review_487323513|This place has an identity problem lol it's like they gave a child the job of interior designer. Sparkly wall paper, paint splattered carpet, neon coloured curtains and pillows...do I say more. There are 3 kind of rooms, we choose the junior suite with spa bath(middle class room). Yes the room is big but it is no way relaxing. Everything was white, so everything had an off white colour to it with a black feature wall behind the bed and bathroom mirror.The quality of the linen is very poor and feels like being in a hospital ward.The bathroom could be very dangerous when wet... the shower is above the spa bath, and the bath is not level so on top of it already being slippery you have to watch your balance. I tried to have a relaxing spa bath, but after trying not to slip in the bath I looked to my right and noticed black mould on the bottom of the wall next to the wardrobe. So that got be out of the bath pretty quickly.The website also states that your room will have city views.....well if city views stands for views of concrete walls of the building next door than you will disappointed just like us. Not only is the room bad for relaxing but the view makes it depressing.Security in this place is not very good. No security guard. You can access the levels with the rooms are on without a card. The doors are pretty thin with no back up locks, so if someone wanted to get it, one kick would knock it down.. I saved the best for last....the safe...so we had to get a safe key because after doing everything right the digital way we could still not gain access to our valuables. Not only that if someone really wanted the safe they could just walk out with it as it is not attached to anything lolBreakfast is free but it is also pretty poor quality. I would just spend the money and go out.Wifi was always spotty...it would work good for a while and than stop. I will give front desk credit for trying to fix the problem.The two good things about this place is the location and the friendly staff on reception

Customer service is outstanding and even though they do not ask for a tip at all, they definitely deserve one.We stayed in a mystic villa, we loved it had a big two person spa inside the villa and the attention to detail was fantastic. The cleaners are fantastic. Now please pay attention to the villas descriptions mystic does say that you will share the outdoor spa and outdoor area, as adults we did not mind at all but other people might so please read before you book.The views are beautiful and you will never get sick of just staring at them.The choice of breakfast is great, and for an extra price you can get it delivered to your villa.Now also remember that this is oia and you will need to walk up stairs, but it is good exercise The only bad thing....even if you could call it bad, was the internet connection. Inside the cave villa it was very hard to get a good connection but once outside it worked perfectly. But again your in oia so maybe it's a good thing that you leave the internet behind because you need to live in the moment.Again the staff make this place even more pleasant will be recommending this place to other people.

But the tour guide "Anna" was an embrassment to your company. Not only was there limited commentary, but the general vibe was that she did not want to be there. The only commentary we got was when she was telling people off for standing up, eating, drinking, asking questions that she deemed beneath her and people wanting to go to the toilet.A certain group of people were always late and each time we stopped they would take even longer. Before we got off at rhiene falls she warned people that if anyone was late again that the bus would take off and they would to make their own way back to Zurich...surprise surprise the same group was late again. Now 15mins they were late...at the start they were unloading their luggage but it seemed after talking a while to the bus driver and tour guide..waiting wasn't a problem and they took as long they wanted..do I say more....hence the bad customer service myself and another couple decided not to tip.. when we got off the bus we got a comment saying "thank you for the tip".Please retrain this staff member as people pay good money to go on these tours and do not need it spoiled by bad customer service.

Restaurants, retail shopping, supermarket and to make you feel extra safe the police station is just across the street. No need for public transport when everything is in walking distance. Yes it might be expensive but you are paying for location and you will not regret choosing this hotel just for that
Shelley W|334B30F6411A10FC2529588FA4870581|Hotel|Magny-le-Hongre: Vienna House Dream Castle Paris|3| “Nearly 4 stars”|review_483856078|We reserved a standard double room, but since they had none available we were "upgraded" to a family room. The family room only had the added feature of bunk beds and maybe a tiny bit bigger.The room cons were:* air con did not work, it was stuck on heater for our whole stay. So be prepared to either sweat it out or open the window.(reading other people's reviews seems like it's a common problem)* the bed was hard as a rock and you only got one small pillow per person* the hot water did not work, only warm water came out. So we contacted front desk and they sent out maintenance and the thermostat in the tap had broken. So he replaced it and after that we had hot water.The hotel is huge so if you can ask for a room close to the lifts because otherwise you will be getting a workout everyday walking to and from your room (think long hallways from the shining lol)Front desk has good customer service.The hotel also has great views from the back overlooking the countryside. It also offers a indoor heated pool and spa.The hotel has a restaurant and a pub that you can order food from. The selection is limited and quite expensive.The hotel has a free shuttle service to the train station/Disneyland bus number 54. I suggest going to the food arcade there for lunch and dinner. A bit cheaper and more selection.Also there is a little supermarket express store in the train station called casino stop there to get drinks and snacks for you rmini bar back in your room.

Not only is it smaller with fewer rides but the customer service was disappointing. We had paid extra money to get unlimited rides passes but was a waste of money due to the lack of rides and also due to rides being closed because of the rain (no one can control the weather) but when you can't go on rides and than you have to pay money to buy a plastic poncho just so you can go somewhere else in the park, so you can some kind of dry. Now that makes me angry.Save your money and go to USA. You will get the whole experience.... great rides and customer service with a smile and a laugh

Very modern and great customer service( the staff should be congratulated). We stayed in a standard room, which was very nice and clean. Could not fault the rooms at all.Now the location is not in the nicest area of Whitechapel(security at holiday inn is great). Whitechapel tube station is about 10min walk and there is a tesco express close by for drinks or snacks also a McDonald's for some fast food.
Shelley W|334B30F6411A10FC2529588FA4870581|Hotel|Singapore: The Porcelain Hotel|3| “Little hotel in the middle of China town”|review_482946162|We stayed in the theme suite. The room needs a good touch up of paint and some putty to get rid of some dents. There are no windows in this room, except for a skylight in the roof which you won't notice till the morning (so please take an eye mask if you do not want to be disturbed by the blinding light).Now the theme suite has a tiny room when you first open the door which only has wall seating and an air con, and than the staircase leading up to the main room. This is a problem if you have luggage, as you will struggle getting them up and down.Both air conditioners did not work so it was a struggle to cool down after a day out in Singapore.The pros are*the hot water and water pressure were great (especially when you like to have a bath to relax after a long day)*the location. You are in the middle of China town, but even better is that the train station is only a 5min walk away from the hotel
Shelley W|334B30F6411A10FC2529588FA4870581|Hotel|Legian: Anemalou Villas & Spa|3| “Has so much potential.....”|review_424687864|Just like the photos, but the villas has some things that need to be improved.so I will least the negatives and positivesNegatives: mosquitos are everywhere, the villas have glass doors and unfortunately there is huge gap up the very top of those doors where they come through. So bring lots of spray and coils.They have a beautiful big bath, and after a big day, all you want to do is have a hot relaxing bath. Nope not here. The best you will get is 30seconds of hot shower after that the water runs cold. We mentioned heaps of times to staff about this problem but nothing was done about it. The villas are located down a side street next to a river, so unless you don't mind spending money on a cab, please go elsewhere. During the day the street is fine but I wouldn't walk during the night.During the weekend there is a nightclub somewhere behind the villas probably in the next Main Street, so you will be able to hear the music until they decided that's it's closing time. Also male cats like to make noise at night.The bed we had really needed to be replaced, it got so bad during the last few days that I had to sleep on the sofa.Ok so now the positives....Modern and big. Kitchen/dining/lounge would be perfect for a family or even a dinner party.Excellent choice of channels if you needed a day in.Pool was beautiful to swim inA small mini mart is within 10mins if you need something.The staff do try but the owners really need to listen to feedback from past and present clientel. These villas have great potential if only someone acted on it

We had a premium deluxe room which is a free upgrade if you book though the official website. Buffet breakfast was included which was great, lots to choose from. Pool area is fantastic, great for all ages. Across from the resort is the beach and you have a huge selection of shops and markets to choose from. Will be coming back here in the future. Customer service is great
Shelley W|334B30F6411A10FC2529588FA4870581|Hotel|Thalang District: Andaman White Beach Resort|4| “Away from the big smoke”|review_385734942|If you want a place that is away from all the busy towns, than this is your place. We stayed in a beachfront pool villa. It was very nice but watch out for those mosquitos, when we firsted entered they were everywhere. Very relaxing sitting outside near or in the pool looking at the water. There are 3 restaurants there. It is expensive but the only other choice you have is a 2min drive in a taxi to nai thon, a small country beach village, with a few restaurants, massage and mini mart. Taxi are expensive around here, so just bear that in mind if you still want to go places. Breakfast was good, great selection of things, but do get there as early as you can before things start to thin out. Also be very careful of the stairs everywhere when it start to rain they get very slippery. So again if you dont mind doing nothing everyday this is your place...but if you still want to have access to shopping etc than this is not your place.

If you find the matress to hard they will add a pillow top to it for you. Bath was great to relax in after a long day out and just step outside you have the pool at your feet. Very close to beach, restaurants and bangla rd. Only negatives was the aircon was not working right, the wifi would drop out and sometimes housekeeping missed certain things. But will recommend banthai to other people

Bathroom is really small and could you an update, also update curtains to total blackout otherwise you will be waking up at 5am every morning lol location is great, close to Cavill ave and beach, without the nightclub noise. Pool is nice but small and would be very crowded during the hotter days. Great customer service

We stayed in the pool villa, expensive but well worth it! Free mini bar, club lounge benefits and breakfast delivered to your room. Customer service is outstanding. The pool in the villa is great and very private, but even the public pool is outstanding. Located just across from legian beach it is very quiet. Yes they are doing construction on a new restaurant/bar area (will be amazing when finished will have greats views of beach) but will not interfere with your stay there. Thumbs up

Room was the honeymoon suite.....very small, hot water was not working and the water had a slimy feel to it. The door came of its hinges and the light on the porch would not go of until morning (you had no switch, it was controlled by the hotel) so you couldnt sleep. Also very noisy area, you can hear the nightclubs, roosters in the morning and dogs barking. And also drunk pple past out in the pool area during the night. Very basic hotel..ok i guess if u were in the nightclub scene but if you were looking to go relax than no. Staff refused to refund any money at start and than after 30mins they refunded only 70% of money paid.

Everything is bigger and better. Rides are out of this world, even the detail in the rides themselves are fantastic. Only negatives are queues and how long they are. So please use your ticket to use fastpast at least you can experience the rides at least once. Food is expensive but what theme park isn't. We only had the day to experience both parts of disneyland, and it can be done. But if we ever go again i would deft stay in Anaheim and use one full day per park.

Location is great.

We were blessed to have beautiful weather when we were there, but if you do go during not so nice days, be sure to rug up and bring the umbrella. Great place to take some amazing photos(next time I will update my camera, so it has a bigger zoom lol) Be sure to take advantage of the extra tours, as than you will be able to see other places like the isle of the dead and the old prison where the children were sent. Also another must is to book a ghost tour! great tour guide and atmospheare.

Love chilling out on board and experiencing what the ship has to offer. This was my first time on the newest boat, the last time I travelled was on the old Spirit of tasmania(the big white one). So i thought well if the last boat was full of things to do, this one must be the cream of the crop....I was disappointed when I got on board. Everything seemed so squashed in and small. I had seen the ship in 5mins flat lol. But i guess the bonus is that everything you needed was on one level. Dinner was expensive, so maybe eat dinner before you get on the ship. The shop on board was like being in a elevator with alot of people :) The rooms were ok, but small and I suggest bringing on the ipad or laptop to amuse yourself. I prefer to travel at night so you can sleep and wake up to the sunrise of tasmania :) Breakfast I would recommend getting once your off the ship. We thought we would try it on board (not doing that again) was very expensive, not alot of choice and was cold. Staff were friendly, so that was a plus. ps, bring back the old spirit of tasmania lol :)

It is nice place to relax on weekend afternoon or evening with selected non veg recipes they offer. I think, however that this restaurant should improve the level of food they offer in terms of taste and range. Overall not a bad deal for the price they charge. I would strongly advise them to not only increase the depth of their menu but also the taste.

We booked 3 rooms for our stay in this hotel for one night. It was through MakeMyTrip. Somehow, we touched the city very late. As soon as we enter the city of Nashik we got the information that there is a curfew in the city, therefore we called up the hotel twice to get to know the exact location of the hotel at around 10 pm. The road was deserted, hence could not found anyone to help. The person at the reception, told us that he is new and could not able to help us inspite of knowing that the guest is in trouble.Somehow we reached the hotel. When we raised our concern at the time of check-in we could not found a sense of regret rather they were into the mode of justifying their behaviour. Well, we checked-in though as there was no option. When we entered our room, we found that beds are twins and to our surprise we came to know that it cannot be joint together. All three of us were couple though. The doors of the toilet cannot be locked from inside for one of the rooms. I can just go on with the list of issues we found in it. We realised that it is the people in service industry that make or break the brand....I would not advise the travels to even explore this as options for your stay in Nashik. There are multiple options available. I even advise, company like MakeMyTrip to not add just any hotel in their list without verifying their service standards.

The facility is very average..it seems they have lost their energy in keeping pace with the industry standards. We enjoyed the dinner with Gahzal but hardly any games or entertainment for kids except table tennis. The visitors may opt for the combo meal pack (Dinner with breakfast) as turned out to be worthwhile. The toilet and towels were not very clean though. No internet available. We found the service staff very cooperative.

It had converted from a heritage building and where some part of still remaining from the olden day. I stayed a night in this hotel and it gave me WOW impression from the day I arrived till departure. It located near to most tourist attraction and also surrounded by lot of great foods.This hotel provided a 5 star services as well as completed facilities for all the guests who stay in the hotel. I was mostly surprised by their lounge facilities that provided to all the guests where it made a closer relationship on the guests with the hotel. It such a pleasure the staff named Mel (one of the hotel staff) had made our stayed completely satisfying with her efficiently and effectively responded on our inquiries. Also, she had impressed us most of the time during the lounge service provided by the hotel with mirth and she adopted a good understanding and knowledge on the wines she offered to us too. All the staffs here are also friendly and helpful; they always served us with the entire smile hanging on their face during the whole stay. Other than a good stay, this hotel also provided a tight securities by guard and checked on everyone who entering the premise. The only service that I unable to put a high score will be on the breakfast it served. Although I understand it a continental food, however it will be the best if the hotel could provided little more selection like sausages or hams for those guest who only could choose eggs as their breakfast. Overall, with the price which I pay on this hotel compare with returned on the end of the stays, I definitely will recommend this hotel as the best to stay with affordable price.

For a first timer like me, I bought everything on the Checklist of our activity to make sure that I will enjoy this trip from trekking shoes/pants, coldgear and raingear and so on but don't worry too much if you didn't complete your stuff going there because in DENR for registration and briefing there's a store there which offers everything you need for Mt.

After this first climb, I told my husband that we should climb a mountain once or twice a year because it was indeed a good experience and a nice way to get close to nature.

First of all when you arrived at Kansai Airport asked for the Tourist Ticketing Booth and make sure to purchase your USJ ticket there where you can avail the ticket in discounted price and you also avoid the looong looong queuing of line for entrance ticket in USJ (promise you'll thank me for this!).Inside the park the first thing to do is to go straight The Wizarding World of Harry Potter to get your Free Timed Entry Tickets since this ticket is limited you better secure one for yourself since this is the main attraction in the park. While waiting for our turn to visit Hogwarts we lined up first for the best ride I've read here which is Spider-Man and it was indeed the best we had blast and enjoyed the ride so much!At the Wizarding World of Harry Potter you will really feel the magical vibe and all HP fanatic will surely enjoy this place like a paradise where your imagination after reading the books or watching the movies comes alive right there. Btw a butterbeer is a must try, a visit to Hogsmeade is not complete without trying this one.Overall, we didn't get the chance to try all attractions there but still so happy and say that our trip is worth it coz we're able to do and try all the best attractions that I've listed and plan to visit in USJ. Also, bring snacks and games with you since all the attractions in USJ requires a minimum of hour waiting, it's the best time for you to enjoy your snacks or games while waiting.

Don't forget to try the Horror House it's fun!From 63 Building we also tried the Sea World and Sky Art Gallery. The Sky Art Gallery is located at the top floor of the building that's why from there you can see the sky line.

They all jumped in near the aquarium and don't want to leave anymore. We spend our Christmas there which I think is a good idea because we're able visit the theme park at the same time and the kids enjoyed the pool the next day. It was indeed a perfect place for bonding where we are all cuddling in the beds while fish gazing. :)

My kids are looking forward to swim in the morning but only to found out all the mess in the pool area. The cleaners told us there's a party held at the pool area last night that leaves all that mess, but I was thinking If we didn't check the pool what time they plan to clean the area? Regarding the wifi, well forget about this because of the poor signal that ends up to no connection.

We also include in our package the Wax Museum of Madam Tussauds and since this is package we have a very limited time. If you plan to visit the peak, it's better to go on your own so that you can enjoy the park and other attractions not worrying about the time.

The bad part is, they only take your photo once on their own cam because when we asked the staff to take our photo with our own cam he refused and told us that we can buy our photo if we want, which I think is unfair because we already bought our ticket expecting to enjoy all the displays inside the museum.

The park offers many activities like the extreme rides that we're so excited to try them all, and after we got tired we go watch the animal show, and of course before we leave we drop by to the souvenir shop. Just too bad that we didn't get a chance to try the cable car because of the strong wind that time. Make sure to wear a comfy shoes because the park is huge so expect to do a lot of walking.

We stayed at near that food court and we took our lunch and dinner many times there. We taste the singapore singature dish which is the chicken rice. It tastes really good and I recommend the steam chicken with rice. My boyfriend loves to eat rice with dishes. So, we try rice with dishes which you can select the various dishes with reasonable price. Last but not least, we ate Mar Lar spicy which is the buffet style. You can choose what you want in your Mar Lar and order as you want like spicy level, soup one or dry one. If you want to appetite, I would like to recommend to try this one but notice that it may cost more than S$10 as they charge the items by weight. However, I enjoyed this a lot and we ate it 5 times during 10days stay. We also enjoyed to have shave ice with red bean as it is the hot weather.

That day is Sunday and we've planned to meet cousin, friend and aunt. Total pax is 5 and we enjoyed our dinner. I like to eat pork belly and meat while others love to eat meat with vegetables. There are different type of sauce you can choose according to your taste. I drank 3 cups of peach drink. The drink is good soft drink with pink color. I don't know how to write review. While I writing this review, I really missed the taste I had at there. There is one thing I like this restaurant is that they change the hot plate when it becomes dark.

My boyfriend like to eat fried rice with eggs and it costs Ks 1,000. For me, I like black sticky rice with coffee which costs Ks 1,000. It might be a little expensive for some people but the taste is good and fresh. The weak point is that they couldn't offer some of the items listed in menu. We have our breakfast two or three weekdays at there. Sometimes, we have our lunch in the way of set menu. You can choose one of the meat curry and fried vegetables with one price and if you want to eat two kinds of meat, they charge in one price. I would like to recommend to try fried fish with sauce and costs around Ks 2,000 but it is enough for 4 persons. Overall, I will rate this shop "Average".

The beach is good for sitting but if you want to swim, I prefer Palawan Beach. The beach is designed for relaxing and sitting along the shore. Walking along the beach is also nice. For us, it was a great memory because my bf wrote "Happy Birthday" on sand although the waves comes and wiped it. We took photo to put it in frame and the photo frame is now on my work table to motivate travelling.

While we are queuing at the entrance, the staff gave us a card but we didn't know how to use that and followed the crowd. Inside, there are many statue where we can put our cards into slot in exchange for prosperity limited edition coin. Then, wait for the lift and go to 9th level or 12th level (the most upper floor). Then, you will see two gallery: Mouth and Head gallery. It is too narrow and you have to follow people in front of you if it's crowded. For us, we met with group of tours who are really annoyed for us. What I remembered about merlion on mouth gallery is that you can take picture at the mouth and enjoy the scenery of city with towers and ships. Near that, there is prosperity bell which can be rung yourself. At the head gallery, you can enjoy the breathtaking view of singapore and discover the name of highest place in the world with exact high number. However, it is too hot at the top. Bring sunglasses or hat to cover yourself. Hopy you enjoy!

As Sentosa is a big island full of attractions, beaches and hotels, you will have a chance to use this. There might be other ways to use tickets to ride this, but I always use my ezlink card to pay for these, S$4 for Habourfront to the station you want. According to my record, the Sentosa Express has four stations: Habourfront (starting point), Waterfront Station (where USS, Sea aquarium and others exist), imbiah station (where merlion exists) and then beach station (siloso beach and palawan beach locate). PS; It's free when you want to move on one place to another within the sentosa. You just need to pay starting from Habourfront. We visited Sentosa for 3 days, the first day we took cable car to imbiah station, but we've ticket to S.E.A aquarium so we use Sentosa Express to ride from "Imbiah to Waterfront Station".

The original price per ticket is S$73 but I got it with S$63 from my friend. FYI, there are another types of tickets which can skip queuing when you visit but this is a bit more expensive. When you arrive at the park, I would like to suggest you to take Universal Studio Map to explore the whole park. For me, I check which part of the park I would like to try first. After riding roller coaster or sth, I ticked the attraction which means I've already riding. By doing that, we can cover the park as much as we can. I would like to recommend to visit the park early so you can spend much time there.If you are a roller coaster rider, you should try these first as many people enjoy to take these also. For us, we have to queue over an hour to ride the Red one. For the convenience and safety of people, they place lockers near roller coasters. The lockers are allowed to use 75mins for free and they will after 75mins. Note: You are not allowed to bring any items if you would like to ride roller coaster. They will lend money if the lockers usage hour is more than limited hour.We took - Roller Coster (Red and Grey), Transformer, Egypt, 4D movies, Madgadascar.There are many show times in different places in the park. Before you visit, check that pamphlet in case you might see your interest.PS: I would like to suggest before you visit there. Please check the weather because when we visited, there was a rain with tremedous thunders. So, some of the places were shutting down in order to safe. So, I didn't try Jurassic Park which is one of my favourite place in the park.Enjoy you trip!

But for us, it was a great time enjoyed together above the sea level. The original price of the ticket is kinda expensive but we got a contact who sells with discount price. So, we bought tickets for Harbourfront Station to Mount Faber (Round) and Harbourfront to Sentosa Station (Round). First, you need to go to Habourfront Tower which you can ride MRT (Circle and Purple LIne). Then, head to Mount Faber First and if you want to spend sometimes there, get out off the cable car and enjoy the picturesque view. There was a souvenir shop, too. After that, go back to cable car station and take a ride to Sentosa Station via Harbourfront Station. For us, we did not get out of the cable car and took ride to Sentosa. But, one of the family who got out of the car need to get in again with our cable car to sentosa station. Whatever, we enjoyed the ride with them, too. We are amazed by the color of the sea which is very clean and green. Moreover, you can see some private boats along the shore. For the line of Harbourfront to Mount Faber, you can enjoy the green views which is the mountain sides. For your information, there is a new cable car line to Sentosa Merlion (I don't know where it starts.) Enjoy your ride if you are in Lion City!

However, it will not be complete if you don't walk Orchard Road. Walking at evening or night would be recommend as the breezes comes and the weather becomes cool down. You can see many shopping malls at each side and many street vendors on the platform. I bought Ice cream sandwich and love to eat it! It only costs S$1.2. If you want to enjoy street performance, you can choose according to your taste like pop, rock and musical instruments.etc. When you feel hungry, there are food courts in Shopping malls (Wisma Atria/ Orchard and so on). Plus, you can enjoy the decoration of lighting along the road!

If you take MRT, you need to alight at Pasir Ris MRT and take bus to Changi Village. This is only to "Boat" which will transport you to island. And, you need to wait 12 persons to set off. If you don't want to, you can hire the whole boat with S$36 as the fees per person to take boat is S$3 per pessenger. So, it may be a good point if you don't bother to wait for people or pay for the whole. If not, waiting to fill 12 seats on boat might be wasting your time. On the island, you can enjoy riding bicycle. There are so many bicycle rental shops and taxis too. But,for us, there was a rain when we arrived to island. So, we chose to sit at coconut drinking stalls. Then, we just walk around and chill the island. Our plan is to visit Chek Jakwa. However, due to heavy rain and to admit that we felt afraid as the forest seems dark and some of the streets are slippery and muddy for walking, we just turned back although there were polices who patrol around the island with car and there was proper signage. When you walking along, you can enjoy the nature and some animals passing through without harming you. We saw big dogs, monkey and wild boar. You can't see that kind of scene in city. And, if you love trees and plants, there are many wetlands. We saw "Fruits Orchard" which is just implemented within short times. So, there will be some big trees in some future days.Whatever, we enjoyed the day at Pulau Ubin!

Wearing cotton dress and short pants would be advantage as it is sweating a lot when walking. Walking with group will be also good. Please take care of the moneys. According to my experience, please don't make eye contact with monkeys. If not, they will go after you. My bf just make eye contact with one of the monkeys, he started to follow my bf and he also tried to open my bf's backpack and pulled out the things in his backpack. So, just be careful.

On a hungry evening after driving over 300km from Margaret River, we stumbled upon Black Bird after our drivers revolted and decided not to drive anymore from our stay in this lovely precinct. We were glad we did. The owner was very accommodating and went over the top to feed 13 of us despite us not making a reservation. What we found was a surprisingly bold and classy place where even a pasta dish and barramundi plate were elevated to new realms of astoundingly creative palates. Ok to be honest we did go back to our place and had supper. But the fact that the thought of the food lingered meant it was enlightening and good although not filling.

Each dish is immaculate in its thought and conception. Kudos to the chef for putting so much effort to make this a complete meal. The cuttlefish starter exuded elements of the sea with every bite, the barramundi was delicious. My husband tried the opulent Xanadu board. It was great although the caramelized pork needed some getting used to. The desserts were lovely. If anything the food came out rather too slowly. So this is not a place for those with a busy margaret river program.

They were kind enough to offer us complimentary Thai salad which was yumz. They probably thought we would starve after ordering conservatively. The only disappointment was the squid which was due to our preference of not having it sit in a gravy. Not outstanding this meal but still good enough really.

From the attentiveness of the bell hop, to the lobby checkin or if you are staying at the horizon club the exclusivity and ostentatious classic design and offerings makes one feel simply welcomed and pampered. The location is ideal for shopping and food. Although the stay doesn't come cheap you pay for something that is close to perfection.

I know this sounds confusing.Hyatt Regency has a million dollar view of the Victoria Harbor and the awesome Hong Kong Island scene, This view is unfortunately not guaranteed as most of the rooms are blocked by buildings. One place that ensures you get this scene is the Regency Club level lounge. We love the service, the view and the cosy atmosphere. Definitely a small price to pay to gain access to a view to die for. The location is not good and not bad. Access to the MTR is about a ten minutes walk. Although street cafes and non ostentatious shops abounds nearby it is still not as accessible to key areas in Hong Kong as one desires.

The rooms are pretty small and dated while the pool and gym rudimentary. Add to the fact that the location is off Shinjuku away from the hot spots for food and shopping, this hotel is worth considering only if you get a good discount, or like us, we claimed free stays with our Hyatt points. Of course there is another plus. If you are into the fitbit craze and want to clock your walking milege. This place definitely helps you clock those miles...about 20 minutes walk to Shinjuku!

The rooms are beautiful. We also love the gym and pool. One of the highest workout one could get. The service as in most Japanese hotels is impeccable. The thing missing is the fact that Toranomon is a bit out of the way. One does not get the creature comforts of a massive shopping arena and food outlets at its doorstep like Ritz in midtown or Shangri-la at Tokyo Station. Then again it is small price to pay for being in a less crowded area. The range of the evening drinks for guests could also be improved.

This chef has departed from the safety of the past while keeping its links. I think Kanda achieves this because he trusts his team of chefs to deliver unlike some restaurants where the sous chefs remain meek and disempowered to move beyond preparing the sides and serving the dish.The food is different and familiar and it helped that when we were lost looking for this obscure restaurant we met a friendly old gentleman out in the street who showed us the front door. It so happened this man turned out to be none other than the renowned master of Kanda. Like his food the grandmaster is comfortable doing something different.

The stay at Ritz is of course more dear than that piece of cake but the thoughtfulness and service are just as impressive. Talking about food it is its location that stands out. It is within walking distance to a cheap or expensive palate and yet not that close to the crowds that Namba or Tokyo's Shinjuku are known for, for oneto feel claustrophobic. Good shopping is also within reach.The rooms are spacious and well endowed. My only suggestion is the typical dark wood finishing that one finds in many Ritz can be complimented by more well lit lighting options. The room can feel too dark.

These harden 'locals' were impressed by the innovative dishes which made the familiar not so familiar.

But Otto Mezzo managed to bring the two together. Simple because the blending of the ingredients that are sophisticated in their own rights cause the overall dishes to come out balanced and measured.Like the Cavatelli Shellfish ragout and sea urchin was a balanced blend between its unique grain like pasta with various taste of from the sea. Of course the sea urchin are not the grade one gets from visiting Jiro or his son in Tokyo but that is not the point. Otto stands out through his bringing together of different ingredients and making them a team not an individual.My husband likes his beef as it is, a steak without any sauces. When the Tajima short-rib and tenderloin came, he was visibly disappointed as it had Otto's sauce poured over his revered meat. But he loved the dish as he found the dip complimenting in a underwhelming way... It did not take away in any measure what a cow should taste like.We ended our meal with the lemoncello souffle and we were glad we did. The souffle was fluffy on the ouside and melted in the mouth.It did help that the staff were very professional and alert. A worthwhile trip!

It's in a need for a makeover especially the bathroom. Also we were there during some large conferences and it was very busy. The staff were fantastic, very courteous and helpful but it didn't change the fact that the elevators were packed all the time. The TV also needs to be upgraded with some new channels, there was seriously nothing to watch but news, Punjabi TV and a few Chinese channels. It caters more for business people I guess.Overall it was a pleasant stay, the rooms are clean, we didn't order room service, the seating at the back with the river is very nice.

This review will more for those travelling with children under 10It's tiring, very tiring but worth it. We did 1 park each day and to be honest 2 days just isn't enough, a 3 day pass would be perfect. First up take a small backpack and take water with you, it can get very hot when waiting in the long lines. The park is very very clean, restrooms are kept very clean also. It's a huge place and it really is magical. If you only have a 2 day pass I'd be avoiding the submarine ride as it has a very long line and to be honest it isn't really worth the wait time. Stay for the fireworks as they are worth it, go near the castle and ask staff for a good spot to watch from, you need to find a spot to sit and wait at least 45mins early. On the other hand if you go to Adventure park and wait for the light show do yourself a favour and get the fast pass ticket. Try to be as close as possible to allow children to watch the show. We weren't told and I had my 8yr old daughter on my shoulder for 25minutes so she could see. Both parks a fantastic and in my mind you need that 3rd day to go back and do what you missed and go on your favourite rides again. Best rides in my opinion Haunted Mansion, Matterhorn Bobsled, radiator Spring racers, screaming roller coaster.....there's more but I didn't get a chance as we ran out of time. I hope it helps anyone looking to visit, just remember both parks are great so be prepared for a very long day and not a cheap day as food and drinks are pricey.

Checking in was very quick and easy and the staff are very polite and helpful. Our room had 2 queen size beds which made things even more comfortable. I found the mattress a little too soft but that's just me. It's a no frills hotel but it's the location you're after. Room was very clean, wifi was good. We didn't use the water facilities as we had no time but we looked at it and the children in there looked they were having loads of fun. I'd be definitely returning to this hotel for price, location and cleanliness alone.

Valet parking at $30 dollars was pricey considering the crown casino carpark was cheaper. We got the double room as there was 4 of us, my wife and 2 children. The room we found was small, a little bit too small. Beds were clean as was the bathroom which was ok in size (no bathtub). I would only stay there for an overnight stay only. The real negatives were NO FREE WIFI which was a bummer but the worst part is you don't even get complimentary bottled water $4 or $5 for the bottle was a bit of joke when you pay so much for a decent hotel. The lap pool is way too small, so if you go there wanting to have a relaxing dip chances are it'll be too full to enjoy, and there isn't enough lounges in there.I would stay there if i was on my own or with my wife just for the night as the restaurants really are what make this place so great for a quick getaway.

The concierge whose name is Firdaus was amazing, I'd lost my wallet and he did everything possible to track it down. Next door you have the Pavilion which is currently building a new hotel, but the noise didnt bother us at all. 5 minutes to Jalan Alor for a nice walk or something to eat, farenheit, lot10, monorail etc etc all very close. Security due to the ASEAN SUMMIT was in full swing so getting in required having bags scanned etc, which i thought was great as it made us feel very safe. i will definitely be coming back to this Hotel. Room was spacious enough, clean and had the normal marble floors and large shower. The only downside was the TV channel options, few channels, picture wasn't clear, so if you have children and want to watch kids shows etc it pays to bring some dvd's Breakfast as mentioned before had everything you really need as well as some nice Indian cuisine, Chinese and obviously western breakfast dishes, the bacon is beef bacon as they don't serve pork but that made no difference. If you want a hotel that's pretty much in the perfect location then this is it.

The street staff are very persistent to get you on their seats, be vigilant and choose wisely. Be careful as there is lots of vehicle traffic especially if you have young children. The food itself is average to above average but for the money well worth it.

We arrived early and although early check in was unavailable they did upgrade our room without us asking for one (thank you ). With 2 young children this hotel is in a perfect spot. 10minute walk to BERJAYA TIMES SQUARE, kids loved the indoor theme park. 10 minute walk to Jalan Alor for dinner and breakfast, 10 minutes walk to Pavilion. The hotel staff are very friendly and quick to respond to all our needs. The room although a little small, was very clean and tidy, bathroom was clean and decent in size. We didn't order anything from our in room menu so i cant comment on the quality of the food. My only criticism would be the hotel bar. They don't offer coffee, juice, spirits only. I would definitely be coming back to this hotel, just on service alone. Internet service (wifi) could be better but it is for free so you cant complain about that.
MarzAttack69|13C8D14814785E2315B2F89EB3EABFAA|Hotel|George Town: The Northam All Suite Penang|4| “Excellent Service but Tired Hotel”|review_210384313|We booked the Family suite for 4 days for my family and my mother in-law.The hotel itself is getting old, it's certainly time to start with some touch-ups. The suite was huge, massive King size bed in the master, Spa, sauna and shower, toilet with bidet, you couldn't ask for more space. You also have a sitting area, a desk and fantastic views. Very large dining room. 2nd bedroom was just as large with 2 double beds, spa, shower and bathtub. Very nice, and totally on the opposite side so it's very quiet and private. The TV lounge area is comfortable and has a huge Day bed for reading. On the downside the little kitchen /sink is very small and has no utensils eg: spoons, forks, knives so eating is a challenge. There is a microwave to warm up food.On the updating of the hotel room i would recommend, new carpets as they are getting old and frayed, a paint job would be ideal to give it that fresh feel. Basically just maintenance and it will be fantastic. The hotel is ideally situated for walks to Gurney drive Hawker, my wife and i walked back after dinner and it took around 30mins of a casual stroll. The porters of the hotel are great as are all the staff. A cab ride into the main town is around 7mins drive by cab and at cost of $15 ringhitt you cant go wrong. The pool is a lap pool (great views ) too deep and plain for the kids, but the staff arranged for us to go to their sister hotel next door (10 min walk) and spend our swimming time there, great pool for children and adults. Overall this hotel is getting old and a little tired, needs some loving but fantastic value and with great service you simply cant go wrong. I will certainly be going back, the kids loved it and so did we.

The food is bordering on average also. They serve a Sarawak laksa which is way over priced and nowhere good enough to say it's good. Breakfast was ok nothing exceptional. The best parts of the hotel were The Pool which is very big and good for the kids, The Gym although i didn't use it was very good also. The staff are very friendly but this place is only good if you want to just sit by the pool and relax all day. There really isn't much else to do there and it's not within walking distance to anything really. I wouldn't be going there next time unless i want to sit back and relax.

Ticket price is high and it is too far 25 Km from the last metro station and only option is taxi from last metro station. Staff not courteous. I asked to take ride again as no one was in the queue but was told to exit and come again from the entry as it is their policy (something not experienced in IMG world and Ferrari World). Adults can go with kids if including second park like Bollywood (which is much better as 4 rides and shows are good) or Legoland. It is not worth a visit. Even if with kids go to legoland and Bollywood park. Not sure why they opened it when all rides are not yet opened (its been 3 months now this park is opened). I asked for refund but was not provided. Even 2-3 rides which are opened were not operating due to technical reason. My only recommendation is dont go! It is a theme park for family with 8-14 years old.

If you have ezClick kind of thing, no need to purchase tickets. There is no seating in the rail, one can have spectacular views of Sentosa Island. The ride time is less than 10 mins, with 3 stops inside Sentosa Island.

There will be a wait time of one hour for each of the rides, and more than an hour for CYLON ride, if you go on holidays. Lockers are provided at each RIDE location to keep your belongings, better keep everything even coins etc in the locker to enjoy ride. Lockers are free for 50 min or so, after that you will have to shell out SGD 4 for hour(the machine won't give you change, so if you keep SGD 10 note, you will be paying SGD 10). Usually the wait time and RIDE time will be more than 50 mins, soiIts better if you keep your belongings in CYLON ride locker as the free locker time is 120 mins over there. This is the place I enjoyed most in Singapore. Happy riding!!

We were told what we needed (flip flops, swimmers, sunglasses, towel etc). We drove about 20 mins to the Elephant Park, where were hopped onto the elephant (on a seat) and went for a 30 min trek (fabulous). Then we went back and got into the pool with the elephant (we each rode) and used hard brushes and small buckets to wash the elephants. They lay down, they were calm, and some clients (who were able) got onto the elephant backs and continued to wash them. It was absolutely fantastic. Oil from the Vista Tours took tonnes of photos which was a great bonus, she was incredibly helpful, knowledgable and friendly. We then had some fruit (pineapple) and water and headed out to a waterfall close by. We weren't able to swim in the waterfall, take photos only, but it was beautiful! We then were taken back to out respective hotels (only 5 on the tour). The tour was about 2.5 hours long and cost us 1500 BAHT each (worth it)! Would highly recommend this tour and tour company as it was personal service, smaller groups and helpful. The others on the tour with us, also went with this tour group to James Bond Island and they said it was great. Conversely, they also went to Phi Phi Island and used another company and they said it didn't compare. Look forward to using them again when back in Khao Lak.

We were picked up from the airport and taken by taxi to the resort (about 1 hour 20 mins to resort - north of Phuket). We were welcomed very well and taken to our room (Deluxe pool room) where we could walk out the front door into the pool (about 1.1 metres) There were plenty of pools around the complex! We got 2 meals in the voucher and the food was amazing, plentiful, delicious and lots of variety between western and Thai food. It was relaxed at both breakfast and dinner with proper cloth tablecloths and napkins. Couldn't fault the food at all! The Beach Restaurant looked over the beach which was delightful. There were layabout chairs on the beach (first in best dressed) but we always got seats when we wanted. The water was warm and the beach really pleasant to swim in. We also got 30 mins massages each per day, which we combined and had an hour massage every second day. We wanted firm Thai massages which was mostly accommodated. They were pretty good, but the ladies who massaged spoke very little English so very difficult to communicate with them about what you want/don't want. Tours can be organised at the hotel (with Gift - who was wonderful)! They have 2 x happy hours per day - 2-3pm and later at night, which were great (2 for 1). The drinks were on a whole good, some days better than others (dependant on the bartender). Its a four star resort which has very good service, food, views etc. If you wish a resort/ area that has a lot of nightlife around, with lots going on, this resort isn't for you. Its quiet, for over 18's, with lots of Germans as guests, and people just wanting to relax and unwind! Well be back, we've already booked our next visit. Can't wait!
Louise M|31E7A794B04691245ABFDCEDFD85F4AF|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|4| “Fun - long lines!”|review_482219583|We booked through Viator, however, I'd make your own way there via public transport or taxi. Cheaper and quicker. It was fun as you'd expect. The fun was dampened by the long lines (I'd hate to be here in high season). Unless you pay an extra $50 for an express pass be prepared to wait (& wait). The express pass gives you priority to get on rides above others who have only paid the entry. The universal studio shop was good as was the shriek 4D and many others. Couldn't wait 60+ mins to get on the roller coasters (that last about 1 min). We stayed for 5 hours which was plenty long enough. It's not huge like the universal studios in the USA
Louise M|31E7A794B04691245ABFDCEDFD85F4AF|Attractions|Singapore: Night Safari|2| “Not Well Organised - Long Wait”|review_482217640|We took the black hop on/off bus to/from. Advice #1 DONT! They are unreliable with scheduling. Got to the park at 7.30pm. after a 50 min ride (said to be 30-40 mins). Had already purchased tickets at Suntech, where we caught the bus. However, we still had to wait in line for another 30+ mins to obtain tickets. Why? We had to join a line that was very very long to gain entry at 8.15pm. The crowd was herded in like cattle. Too many people provided tickets without facilities to cater for such large crowds. We waited for over 35 mins ie 8.50pm when an announcement was made -no further entry until crowds (already inside) had cleared. We walked through at approx 9pm. The night safari show was full (it started at 8.30pm). The crowds waiting to get on the trams to do the night safari were horrendous ....long long wait (again). We had to leave without seeing anything as the last return bus left at 10pm. Advice #2: take a taxi to/from as there will be more flexibility. Be mindful it's quite a distance from the city so this can be costly. Advice #3: Arrive at 7pm (when it opens) or after 8pm ( when crowds were less). It appears the 7.15 or 8.15pm entries are most popular. The park is open to midnight (I believe -check). The food is very expensive - even the ice cream! Too many tickets are issued for entry without proper crowd controls in place or consideration of the practicalities ie how many people can this complex comfortably hold, manage and give a positive, lively experience too. There must be a better method than what is currently in existence.
Louise M|31E7A794B04691245ABFDCEDFD85F4AF|Hotel|Singapore: Pan Pacific Singapore|4| “Great Location - Very Clean!”|review_481858036|We arrived after flying from Australia - tired...to arrive at checkin with an incredibly long line. We waited for 1/2 hour to be checked in. It was quicker to drive from the airport to hotel! 2 employees took over 25 mins with 3 clients in a group which left 1 other employee to checkin guests. Employees were running around together with walkie talkies, without serving a customer, just looking st them as they walked past. It was terrible service. We ate at the buffet breakfast which was good, lots of choices, both western and Asian food. The cost was very high for a breakfast buffet (approx $55 sgd) each. No real complaints, but not worth the $$$$We also ordered food poolside, which took 40 mins to arrive. The food was not good in quality, presentation or taste. A big letdown. We are 2x breakfasts on L1 marketplace where we had the healthy option breakfast and the continental - both were delicious and good value for money (plus great coffee). The toilet door is not full length, it doesn't reach the roof or Frame, so odd. We had a room with a balcony overlooking Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Singapore flyer. We could also see the gardens by the bay and city skyline. It was a lovely view. The location of this hotel is one of its highlights. It's connected to 2 large shopping centres, including Suntec, a major hub for trains, buses and shopping. There are so many shops and eating places inside the shopping centres if you want toeat outside the hotel, cheaply. Suntec is where you can catch the hop in/off bus (plus others). It's in walking distance to marina bay sands hotel, gardens by the bay and the Singapore flyer. You can walk 2 blocks to visit Raffles hotel. It's very conveniently located outside the mayhem of Orchard Road. Overall, I'd stay again due to its location. The staff, overall, were not oarticularly service minded (waitresses in marketplace were). However, the hotel had some great features (their pillows not being one of them), which made our trip to Singapore easier.

The Raffles Hotel is iconic and well worth a visit. We thoroughly enjoyed the High Tea. The food was delicious and plentiful and the service attentive. We had a Singapore Sling at "Tiffin" High Tea (cost $28). Tip: if you buy the Singapore Sling at a bar outside of the High Tea at Tiffin it will cost almost $40. It was well worth the visit and going to high tea - absolutely memorable.

It's a great way to get an overview of the city to come back and explore if you don't want to hop on/off immediately. Later in the day we took the yellow route which was also good but not as interesting as the red route. Be mindful that the staff say it's an hour round trip however we found it was anywhere between 1 hour 10 mins to 1 hour 25 mins, which meant we missed the connecting bus to the night safari at the zoo as a result of not returning in the advised timeframe. Nothing can be done when that occurs.

It was very noisy (even on a Sunday night). The food was good but nothing really special. We tried the fried calamari and the crepe for entrees, which were delicious. The next course we had the veal (not bad) and the prawn pasta which was also ok. For dessert, creme caramel (with absolutely nothing else- not even a 1/2strawberry as a garnish) was ok- nothing special. The others had sticky date pudding which was better and they enjoyed. Overall, for the price it was good and value for money.

A raspberry chocolate gateau was enjoyed as was the Devils cheesecake. They weren't too sweet and were lovely. The cafe is quiet, if you need some down time in Fremantle to just sit and relax, chill and enjoy some cake/coffee. Breakfasts and light lunches are also served but we didn't have anything from those menus. The waitress is helpful and efficient.

The initial experience with the Matre de was less than pleasant, she was efficious and rude. However, we were seated in a lovely area inside, comfortable with views outside. We shared the duck liver entree and the pea and kale croquets,which were delicious. Then we shared the fish cakes main meal with 2 x scoops of our salad of choice from the menu. We were advised by the lovely waitress that if we shared 2 x entree, we wouldn't need 2 x mains, it would be too much. We took her suggestion and she was right. The pictured 'buffet' is only for the staff to access to make up the orders, its not open for the public to pick/choose from. I had the nutty berry smoothie which was disgusting however, the banana smoothie was apparently lovely. The food was very enjoyable, tasty and fresh. The fish cakes were especially yummy! The coffee was mediocre. I asked for a large (if I received a large it was the smallest large coffee Ive ever seen). I asked for extra hot and it was luke warm. I would return to this restaurant as the food was good, however,they need to sort out their service (ie seating, paying bills, asking if clients need anything else etc) so that its much more efficient and the service is attentive. Worth a visit if you are at Elizabeth Quay.

There are a few cafes down there. We ate at the Isle of Voyager, which was very pleasant (don't have the nutty berry smoothie - horrible). The staff at the restaurant were a mixed bag, some friendly and helpful others not. Not a lot to see YET but great to have something to eat and a walk around in a relaxed atmosphere. You can hire cars there, organise ferry trips and visit the Bell Tower.

They are spacious rooms, with well appointed facilities (modern). The pillows were very good, however, the bed a little on the soft side. We had no real view out of our room, just onto other buildings with a little peak at a park across the road. We had a look at the pool on Level 1 as we thought about relaxing around the pool. The pool area did not look cared for, with wet towels left in the area and it just didn't look well kept, and appeared unclean. We had room service one night as we only wanted a lite dinner. We ordered 1 x entree size salad, 1 x side order salad, 2 x desserts (small) and 1 small bottle of coke + 1 small bottle of lemonade ---- $69 in total. The food was tasty but the prices are high end for a hotel restaurant, more like fine dining prices. The hotel is situated in a quiet, handy area of the city. You can catch a bus across the road (free) to go into the CBD. You could walk it, but its a 2-3 kms. The staff at the front desk and cleaning staff were friendly and helpful

David asked if we needed help with the menu ie did we want him to choose dishes in conjunction with our food preferences. David was fantastic- he wanted to know how spicy we wanted our food and recommended delicious dishes. We had the Viet salad [awesome],shared chilli tofu [yummy] and then had Peking duck and sambal prawn [adjusted heat according to preference]. The food was absolutely delicious and couldn't recommend the food and service highly enough. Can't wait to visit Perth again to eat here again. It is well worth a visit. Yummy!!!

Sharing plates. We had the kingfish sashimi, duck pancakes, cod salad, tempura soft shell crab and squid salad. Could not fault any of them. Different, delicious, fresh and absolutely noteworthy. We then had dessert. I had the Viet coffee ice cream with Chinese donuts and the other order was an orange granita ('would have preferred ice cream) and a choc dessert with it. The Viet dessert was sooo delicious with only one criticism of other dessert (above). If you want sparkling mineral water it's $5 for unlimited refills. All up it was $130 for 5 x plates and 2x desserts I can't wait to return to Melbourne to visit this restaurant again. An absolute highlight!!!!!
Louise M|31E7A794B04691245ABFDCEDFD85F4AF|Hotel|Melbourne: Mercure Melbourne Treasury Gardens|3| “Small rooms without 'soul'”|review_440242499|Stayed four nights. When I came into the room (night 2) it had a very pungent odour. We couldn't be moved out that night due to hotel being fully booked. David, the manager was very helpful and he could not have done more to be service oriented - very good eg. A odour eater was put in the room but it still stunk. We were moved to another room the next day for the last 2 nights, which was much better. The hotel needs an upgrade and revamp with wallpaper and furnishings not conducive to spending any time in the bar/restaurant. The little things were absent ie clean glasses every day (didnt replace/wash used glasses) although there were ample toiletries provided. For the price I think it needs to lift its standard. The hotel is a 15 minute walk to Bourke st mall or can catch city trams (no charge in CBD) to anywhere in the CBD. Lovely restaurant close by 'Lucy Liu' Oliver lane. (7min walk)

Louise M|31E7A794B04691245ABFDCEDFD85F4AF|Attractions|Melbourne: Go West Tours|3| “1 hour late for pickup - a mess!”|review_440208500|Booked, gave hotel address in booking and informed p/up would be 12.10pm. 12.25 pm called Go West ,informed bus would be there in 15 mins. 20 mins later called again as bus hadn't arrived and informed will be there in 5 mins. It showed up 1 hour late. The driver came in to hotel reception,called booking name and said let's get in the bus. He immediately walked out and got in the bus There was no apology or niceties, it was a very rude introduction to Go West. Headed down to pearcedale wildlife park where you could get close shots of kangaroos and koalas - even feed kangaroos. Then onto the Phillip Island winery where we had wine/cheese - very pleasant. Onto Cowes where we could wander/eat. Great little cafe on the pier that has the BEST jam donuts - anywhere!!! Took a tour of Nobbys - where there's is a boardwalk/ visitors centre -allows lovely views of rugged coastline. Took a back road along coast to Philip island penguin parade. We paid extra for the guided tour from Go West (cheaper than at venue) and it was worth every cent - fantastic. We were taken on a tour - with explanation and commentary - then onto priority seating (with seats provided) with the best views. It was a lovely experience!!!!! Got back to Melbourne about midnight. Recommendations: lessen time at stops - too long at most places, which was evidenced by most people waiting to get on the bus at time ie they were ready to move on earlier. Secondly, if bus isn't to p/up people at time informed - make a courtesy call to inform client (you have their phone # on file) Don't have customers continually chase up their p/up and ask what's going on? Then have the bus driver say waiting st the hotel is better than sitting in the bus - which is not the appropriate response or helpful. We would have planned differently if it was an hour later for p/up. Thirdly, use a friendly,welcoming bus driver who is service and hospitality minded - rather than a person who acts like his job is that of a bus driver only!

Female staff member who 'welcomed' us was less than 'welcoming' - unfriendly to say the least and didn't set us up with a great start. Had the savoury plate, which was delicious. We both had the duck, which was ordinary and overpriced!!! Accompaniments were minimal and not up to standard for a $40+ priced meal. We waited over 1 hour for our main meal, with one request did we need more drinks. American/Canadian waiter was pleasant enough, although non conversant. Food was ok, but definitelynot worth the prices charged and the lady out front needs to change her attitude or her job!!!! I'm unsure what the hype is with this restaurant, with so many great eateries in Melbourne?

Asked to come back in 15 minutes, which we did. Had to wait another 15 mins to get a table. Other guests came in after us and were seated and ordered before us. The wait staff just kept walking past without enquiry of ehether we would like a drink or like to order. They seemed more focused on cleaning up after the function-resetting ALL tables prior to looking after the guests that had arrived and ensuring their needs were met. The food was average -Veal saltambocca and veal Marsala were ordered. Ordered the -Anna cotta which was smothered in berry jus (not asked if wanted it plain or with berry jus) and it was just ok. The Italian ice cream was prepackaged so can't go wrong. I would not go back - the experience is not one I wish to recreate and the food was not noteworthy.

We were just as impressed this time around. The portrait gallery was so interesting and engaging, we really enjoyed the work. The 2016 photographic exhibition was on as well and that was also really great, well worth a look! We spent a couple of hours there, taking our time looking at the art and reading about the art/artists, it was truly a lovely 2 hours spent! I would recommend this gallery as one of the best in Canberra!
Louise M|31E7A794B04691245ABFDCEDFD85F4AF|Hotel|Canberra: Pavilion on Northbourne|4| “A great hotel with lovely buffet breakfast!”|review_386000138|We stayed at this hotel for one night and found the room to be of good size, clean and well appointed. The bathroom is very small but manageable. We ordered room service for dinner and it was delicious and plentiful. The bar area downstairs is warm and inviting and worthy of a drink or too. We had the buffet breakfast which was really good ($20 is paid when check in $25 if pay on the day) and it was very good, better than we expected. Good quality food with lots of variety - with helpful staff. Only downside the coffee from the "Nespresso' was only lukewarm - this needs to be addressed. Proper coffee made by a Barista would make the buffet fantastic! All in all, I would recommend this hotel, great value for money and its a nice place to stay and have brekkie. Ill definitely be back!
Louise M|31E7A794B04691245ABFDCEDFD85F4AF|Restaurant|Canberra: Courgette Restaurant|3| “Fine dining in relaxed atmosphere”|review_383621068|We arrived and had the four course ($88) menu, which is all that's on offer. We started with a choice of 2 (1st course) between smoked salmon and a goats cheese platter. We both chose the goats cheese with a slice of heirloom tomato and some other little things. It was ok but lacked taste and the wow factor. I then had the venison which was delicious, a highlight. My companion had the pork belly which was also the highlight. We both had the wagyu beef cheek which was ok, very rich and nothing special. It took over 3 hours to get through 3 courses, it's a long wait for each course so If you want a long slow dinner this is the place, if not, go elsewhere. The serving sizes are very small but presented in a pretty manner. We had to ask for dessert to be served as we had waited almost 3.25 hours was it worth the wait? The apple pie was delicious (needed more custard - couldn't find it on the plate) and the brownie was "alright". This restaurant us worth a try! Had some hits and misses!
Louise M|31E7A794B04691245ABFDCEDFD85F4AF|Hotel|Brisbane: Pullman Brisbane King George Square|2| “Definitely NOT 5 star - more like 3.5 or 4 star!”|review_383618318|I attended a conference at the hotel and stayed for business. We arrived and told (in no detail) about the wifi (useless). The room and furnishings were tired. The sheets had stains on them as did some of the furniture and furnishings. There was no blow dryer in the room (had to ask). The breakfast buffet was below standard. The food was cold and there was little variety. If you wanted a freshly cooked omelette it was unbelievably slow. Definitely not a quality 5 star buffet. The staff were friendly. The bag drop off, once checked out, was very well organised. I would not recommend this hotel as a quality hotel in any sense of the word. I won't stay there again. The noise of traffic could also be heard.
Louise M|31E7A794B04691245ABFDCEDFD85F4AF|Restaurant|Alice Springs: Kings Creek Station|4| “Good honest country Aussie brekkie”|review_358691431|Stopped here for brekkie on AAT trip to kings canyon. A big, generous brekkie with eggs, toast, bacon, sausages, baked beans etc plus cereals, jams etc. it was all very good. We went next door to the cafe to grab a 'real coffee' which was $8.40 per cup!!!!! The most expensive coffee I've paid in Australia. It was clean, well set up and the food was hearty and tasted good! Passing by in way to kings canyon drop in for brekkie.
Louise M|31E7A794B04691245ABFDCEDFD85F4AF|Restaurant|Alice Springs: Barra on Todd|4| “Good food - slow service”|review_358689819|We arrived at the hotel and booked a table for 8pm. Didn't get a table until 8.30pm. It was a busy Saturday night on a long weekend. We ordered and were told it would be 1/2 hr wait (at least) to get dinner. It was about 40mins. Had the kangaroo which was delicious albeit over cooked. Stiuffed duck breast was Aldo ordered which was enjoyed very much. Once dinner was finished we were asked fix we want to wait for dessert or have now. As we were exhausted we said have now. We had to still wait 20 mins for dessert which was creme brûlée and mars bar dessert. They were delicious but it was all so slow in delivery. I had to chase up a glass of wine yet wasn't delivered. The food was good but let down by the lack if service - which was poor!
Louise M|31E7A794B04691245ABFDCEDFD85F4AF|Attractions|Yulara: AAT Kings|5| “Very well organised, helpful and value for money”|review_358687243|We did the sunrise and dpsunset tours of Uluru. The sunrise tour was fabulous apart from the long narratives about aboriginal beliefs and stories - too much! The sunset tour was good as it went to the organs also but the sunset at the Rock was a bit anticlimactic. The walk through the gorge at the Olgas was hot and ok (not earth shattering). We also took the trip from Yulara to kings canyon where some went on the rim walk ( for the initiated and fit) and the creek bed floor (for those who lacked fitness or a willingness to walk hours in the heat). Both were very good. There was opportunity to swim in the pool ( which was taken up) and then we came to Alice springs it was a long day with a 4am start that ended in Aluce Sorings @7pm. AAT Kings tours have been very good and would highly recommend.

It was a lovely experience with enjoyable surrounds. Worth a visit!

A bit rushed but would like to spend more time next time. Really like their whites, not so much their reds. Will be ordering whites via Internet (cheaper than cellar door). One of our favourites on Barossa Valkey winery tour!

It was busy! We had the pasta with seafood with a cheese sauce. It was quickly served and had lovely flavours. Only complaint - the service wasn't good- had to chase waiters up for any service. It wasn't attentive or helpful. We decided to eat and run - didn't want to hang around with such bad service. Food was great though

We headed up through the hills and firstly stopped at TeAro. Really liked their whites -cellar door sales. We went to maggie beers dpshop which was delicious. Also went to wolf blass (ho hum) and Pindarie, which was really lovely. Great wines and surrounding property. The ,lunch was great. The itinerary will be change from A0pril 1st, some different wineries and dropping some. TeAro and Pindarie will still be on the itinerary - worth visiting! A great day with Greg and Matthew! Very knowledgeable and helpful.

It was a long day down from Adelaide and back (15 hours) but well worth it. We travelled around the island stopping at various points of interest. It was great! Would highly recommend doing the day trip and if you have more time do a 2 dayer- so much to see and do. An untouched gem! We booked through Sealink adventure tours (Grayline cruises) where the bus drivers / guides are locals. Lunch was ok - nothing special.

It was well appointed, good size room and well maintained. The staff were very helpful in whatever was asked if them. The hotel us about a 10 min walk to Rundle Mall. We had a continental breakfast one morning which has very adequate variety, with good bakery goods - recommended! It was a great hotel with great facilities and handy to city centre.
Louise M|31E7A794B04691245ABFDCEDFD85F4AF|Hotel|Orange: Mercure Orange (Templers Mill)|5| “Clean, comfortable and modern”|review_356916313|We stayed one night and we were very pleased with the location (close to shops, cafes and restaurants) and the room. The room was modern with a microwave (but no crockery or cutlery) included. We asked for an 11 am checkout which was agreed. The beds were very soft ( not the best I've slept in) but ok for a night. The room was $175 which I thought was expensive (Sydney prices) for a country town motel (or were the prices jacked up because 1000 people were coming to town for a cycling event)? It was very good with no complaints other than what's expressed.
Louise M|31E7A794B04691245ABFDCEDFD85F4AF|Restaurant|Sydney: Cafe Opera|4| “Mid week Buffett - very good”|review_356914086|Dropped in after a conference without a booking. We had the buffet which was very good. Had seafood, cold meats, salads, hot meats, veggies, cheeses, desserts and more! Good value for money and I would recommend (don't buy vouchers for this restaurant on scoopon, Groupon etc) it's very difficult, if not impossible, to get a date to go on a weekend, only availability is Monday - Wednesday yet not advertised as such. However food was good , service slow and had to wait lengthy periods to have plates cleared and drink orders taken.

However it took time (too much) to place the initial order had to stop the waitress to place the order. Food and coffee were good quality and fresh. Would recommend for quality and price.

Shared chips, calamari salad, mini burgers, Mac cheese and more. All of them were delicious A wide variety of mains were ordered from sausages and mash, pasta, fish, schnitzels - all were enjoyed with generous size portions. Prices were reasonable with $36 for the fish -expensive for what received - otherwise no complains. Sparkling mineral water $5 for first bottle - the rest free ( but difficult to get refills). Service was on the slow side but friendly. Really done the place up well , very nice surroundings. Had a band/ music that was pretty noisy. The dining room at the front was also a noisy venue.
Louise M|31E7A794B04691245ABFDCEDFD85F4AF|Restaurant|Sydney: Mentmore and Morley|3| “Average food and not good service”|review_356911672|We went mid week and had brunch. The service was slow with coffees coming after the meal was served and no follow up as to whether we needed anything else.... More coffee! The ricotta pancakes with banana and praline butter were OK with lots of pancake and little accompaniments. The eggs benedict were OK as well. I've tried it and won't return as I think the menu is too limited and my midweek experience wasn't worth repeating!

Has amazing cakes like the watermelon cake, brownies, Portuguese tarts, custard tart, almond croissants and great hot meat pies but comes at a hefty price! Relaxed casual atmosphere - always busy. We went there for a wine degustation last week ($150 pp) with food provided by the cafe (tasting plates to share) and wine by Tobreck? Barossa valley (Barneys winery Rosebery) The food was lovely - too little too slow with one small plate per person used for the whole night (no plate changes - no glass changes either). It's an annual event that I won't attend again. They need to stick to cakes and pies!

We were pleasantly surprised! It's really well fitted out for a local eatery. We had fish cakes (shared) which were delicious. Then flathead and largish potato chips, linguine with seafood and a tomato and mozzarella salad. Great tastes - food was good quality, fresh and tasted great - the only criticism is the serving sizes were on the small side and there needed to be more buffalo mozzarella (very scant). We had the gay time parfait and the choc mouse - both really lovely (but expensive for desserts for a local eatery ($14-$16). Service wax attentive and prompt. Will return for another round.

We (4 of us) went and had the $48 (entree and main meal) plus desserts and a few accompaniments and drinks! The food and drinks were fantastic value and the presentation, taste, service was exceptional. 2 of us had the pork belly and the duck which was delicious and 2 of us had the tempura prawns and the market fish of the day (salmon) and that was said to be lovely. I had the lemon myrtle white chocolate cheesecake, with the only criticism being you couldn't taste the lemon myrtle. Others had the fig and ginger pudding with butterscotch sauce which was "beautiful" and the dark chocolate brûlée which was highly recommended. It was a lovely dining experience, the food surpassed the price and I would highly recommend this restaurant. I will return when Im next up at Lake Macquarie.

I've traveled 61 countries and can now at the Doorstep I can make out if this Hotel is good for stay and courteous!Having given a Prelude, I wanted to make a special note to the Ladies at the Front Desk (I do not remember the names) Their smile and wishing attitude made an effect to the courteous tone of the staff.

Especially with my 3 year kiddo!It's in a very decent place about 18 - 20 kms from the Changi Int'l airport and with good eateries around!I think they can make the rooms bit kids friendly! In a way when asked can provide a bucket n mug n some things like water bottles kept on the table, etc. Small things go long way which I learnt when I'd stayed at Marriot in USA with my kid. All in all the staff are friendly and we'd Indian food packed, so had to ask for plates and bowls and were provided at ease!Good hotel in a decent area!

Waaayyyyy more than Enjoyyyy...Yeah I know, Using the same yyy, again and again, is not good for readers. But I could not control the exuberance of the Joyful moments near Mustafa center.

We could get a very decent service and the Vada was tasty to the core. The price was really really decent compared to Shivsagar and woodys in commercial street. As a connoisseur was up for quick grab of taste, but, Gosh! Was I impressed, I was sunned. Idlis were big and smooth and chutney was amazing.

Service was really greater than my expectations!Food: Buffet was around 317Rs. as it was a weekend we visited. We were a family of 4 with 2 families and included a 2.5-year kiddo. We could not bear the hot ness in the food. I've not yet mentioned what all we'd ordered, as almost all were high on spicy-ness. Yes, it was not an all Buffet meals, we had 3 A-La-Carte menu eaters and we had a decent crowd who wanted to munch delicious taste of their own. Buffet Menu - 1 Buffet which included, Paneer pepper/dal soup, Pani puri, fruits, friums, onion rounds, pakoda, veggie salad, paneer tikka, Gobi Manchurian, naan, biryani, paneer masala, dal, rice, rasam, carrot halwa, rasagulla, ice cream, chocolate sauce. Spread was wide and nice but most of it was too spicy! Rice was not soft and rasagulla was like prepared a week ago!Menu we'd ordered - Tomato Soup, Gobi and Baby corn Manchurian, Butter and plain Naan, Paneer butter masala, Vanila and Strawberry milk shake. Tomato Soup was like ketchup and very low on salt, Gobi Manchurian could not be kept in mouth too spicy, we wasted 3/4 th of Gobi, Baby corn manchurian was good but oily, Butter Naan, Paneer butter masala , Vanila and Strawberry milk shake was very good. So its getting a 4star as main course is more important for me than anything else. Ambience - Its absolutely GREAT, has a great touch of romantic effect with lowered lights and great light on tables with pebble stones was awesome. Overall an experience which has to be Experienced!So I give it a thumbs up.

They've done some good interiors and got a better customer service now.Also increased their prices. You'll find a board of Gokul veg at the top and the restaurant is on the first floor. However, the taste of the north Indian food is Great. So worth the money you spend. Customer service is good enough. Butter Naan and Paneer Hyderabadi which we took really amazed us in taste. Thali is only available for the lunch and not dinner and this hotel is only for Noth Indian Veg Cuisine and does not serve south indian cuisine. If you are looking for latter, please be aware of this fact. All in all a good restaurant in the Gandhi Bazaar area.

All are so well trained which adds a warmth to your stay and go back again!Secondly, the amenities from the staff, ask for a tooth brush/water/anything, is available in minutes at your room and again with a Greet.

Post that all the roads were fine. Road leading to savandurga is pretty nasty full muddy road and totally unfit for two wheelers. Cars would surely manage this as we did. We started staring the hillock to trek our way up by 10:45AM. Climbing up post the Narasimha Swamy devasthanam which in itself is a fantasy. A small write about the Narasimha Swamy statue - When the aarthi is bought near the navel of the deity, it turns off. Thats because, its said, almighty is breathing from his navel in this place. Post this we started climbing and first small stretch in itself is pretty strenuous. Though it is 11AM we started, it felt like the scorching heat is sucking our blood off!Its about 5.4kms as per my app we walked and it was quite steep at the last stretch we climbed. More nastier was, getting down, which was a pain in the wrong place. Once we went 3/4th the guy from the foot hill store bought bejois and we rejoiced :) That guy climbs up almost 5 - 8 times a day in peak season (winter). Peak was the best and all the hard work and pain was more than worth in a minute. It just shook our mind off. Had a nice chat near the basava temple and started our decent. It was steep. Had to walk on four legs. But decent was much better than the ascent. All worth for a trek with colleagues (choose winter) who open up in such places. Must go once for a trek but to the Darshana of the Narasimha swamy, any time!

Its on swiggy, tripadvisor's good list, mouth share, zomato and many other site's top listings.Quite famous masala dosa, is the best food a foodie would love to taste.Now the system in the hotel is evolved quite nicely. Fast responsive waiters, easy electronic billing, and walls full filled with fame of restaurants own credibility!Crowd in hotel is v high especially on weekends. So waitin could be anywhere from 10 -30 minutes. One downside to masala dosa, they pour chatni in the plate itself. So you can't have dosa without mixing with dosa.All in all its a must visit for dosa lovers.
AshokNrao|3AAC665583F93975E895D08BC3532107|Restaurant|Bengaluru: Maiyas Restaurants Pivate Limited|2| “`Differ from the crowd majority! Not so good”|review_351214209|The whole agony in Maiyyas in J'nagar is they have 3 floors, and south indian in one floor. North Indian in 2nd flr and full meals on the 3rd. Whole reason I go to hotel as a connoisseur is to try something new and tasty! I can't decide what to eat the day I go forehand going there. I can't just eat north indian or just south indian. I eat a mix of it. Second biggest issue is the time we went. By 8:30PM. We decided to go to south Indian though we had 4 candidates for North out of 6, we din't want to divide our family as Maiyya's did. First We ordered pavbhaji, mangalore bajji and kachori chat and rasamalai. All the 3 are closed! rasamalai was only one available out of 6 we ordered!So we ordered rather bad choice veg cutlet, which none of us liked which was the only thing available at that time. Third ordered tomato soup, which was non spicy and had no bread pieces in it. When asked they don't give bread pieces. We now ordered main course and off course milkshakes because we could now understand that it also would be closed: Only dosa was available. We by no heart , ordered masala dosa, rava masala and special masala dosa, bisibele bath, rava idli. Bisibele bath was good enough and with that was given a small katori with ghee. Even special and rava masala dosa came with ghee. Rava masala was okish and special masala dosa almost had no alu palya in it. When asked for sagu we finished the plate without it as waiters din't come out as they sunk in somewhere.  Best part is milk shakes came before main course and waiter said its last specially made for you. All in all, not a good experience with family!

I think on the 10th floor, there is a stretch where we can see canvas paintings displayed in a glass stretch walkway. It looked fab and modern art, we had to predict what painter was conveying. But, each one big enough to be legible and understand was costing nothing less than 7.5K. Food also was ridiculously high price. So go have a look, click enormous photos and return. Must visit in Bangalore for me!

Tomato soup was not hot and bread had a stale taste!Kerala parota was nice, but veg kolhapuri was not spicy, though we ordered it to be spicy!There were flies and mosquitoes, out of which one fell into our plate. There should be some pest control done firstWe asked for lemon when the parota was served and was not cared off at all. I remembered and asked again later after 1 is finished and then they attended. Overall, OKish place for a visit

Dim sum were delicious, service efficient and lovely ( not given to be honest as i have been to several restaurants in this town where people are efficient but they look like they want to kill you) not at this restaurant lots of smiles from waitress and staff in the kitchen ( open kitchen, love it!!) . Also found out that service is not included so maybe that's why but frankly I am more than okay to pay for this level of service.Seafood rice was delicious. Veggies were perfect!

The supermaket ( market place) has great products but at prices that make Whole Foods in the U.S look cheap. It is worth going there for specific things that you can not find anywhere else but do not buy everything there. Repulse bay beach was disappointing . Full of tourists who walk on the beach dressed up and took photos of everything. Water was also dirty :-(

From poor service in flight ( play a game and look for the flight attendant ( often moren than 1) who does not want be there, it will not take you long to find this person in eco AND business!!!!) ( yes there is no first class in Delta!) you have to pay for champagne in the lounge!!!! ( only business class lounge I have been where you have to pay for champage). In flight food is simply the worst of all airlines even in business class it is not eatable, last time I had beef was so chewy and served with a couscous with no taste, i could not eat it. dessert is always the same ice cream or low quality pudding and poor choice of cheese. If case you fly eco you have to pay earphones ( so cheap!!)Delta tried to put some lipstick on the pig in the past few years with new uniform and even having the CEO on TV but the service and quality of the food are the major issues. I would recommend any Delta employees or customers to fly Japan airlines, Singapore airlines, Cathay Pacific, Emirates and learn from them, outstanding service, smiling people, delicious food. I had an amazing rare steak on Korean Air: three level above business class so called 'food' served on Delta. Only plus for Delta great selection of movies and entertainment (but again be aware that customers in economy class have to pay for headphones to watch!!)To put it in one sentence : I recently flew domestic on Japan airlines and business class on Delta and I preferred 10 times the service and quality of Japan Airlines eco versus Delta business!Would recommend to avoid Delta if you have the choice.

We made the HUGE mistake to order the Margarita pizza which arrived cold ( we live less than 5 miles away!!!!) and completely covered with black pepper ( WHY, really WHYYY???!!!!!) we could NOT touch that over priced basic 26$ large pizza ( for the kids so even worse) !!!! Please DO Not order the Margarita pizza in any size. The Greek pizza was cold but eatable ( still some black pepper but someone in the kitchen decided NOT to destroy it). Sorry Blue Moon Smyrna but you are completely OUT of the game and I love pizza which means you really did NOT perform. Moving on to your all competitors in all other locations.

But is the quality good? I took the duck breast and it was amazing! We took the tasting platter for 4 and it was average, the wine was good. service was good but very few people on a Tuesday evening.Areas to watch no one advised us of the timing of the starter with the tree show, for a 85SGD starter 6 min wouls have made a huge difference on the arrival of the food versus the 10min show so food was cold, no exscuse for a good and empty restaurant. The scallops were average but fresh :-)The bottle of water was 15 SGD!!CRAZY!!!The perfectly cooked duck with amazing sauce and good service saved the day but still not sure I would go back or recommend at this stage since you can have the view in other places and just too expensive for what it was! Tourist trap is to strong but somewhat true.Ben

You will pick up a bit of speed. Sometimes it gets crowded and it is less fun because you are limited on your speed and space to manœuvre. If you are afraid of heights, you might be scared a bit because to come back you to have use chair lifts and they go high. The first round of ridding you have to queue in the big line with everyone so someone shows you how to break and control then you get your hand stamped. Second time and more there is a different line which is much shorter so be aware. My big issue with this places is the helmets. There have weird sizes and big surprise they do not get cleaned which is so unusual for Singapore where everything is mostly clean. People come back and put there helmets in a bin that is immediately reused by new people coming. So helmets are dirty and sweaty not talking about lice and other 'nice' presents left in these weird sized helmets. Note for management: please clean the helmets before re-use or offer tiny shower caps to customers.

I have seen people going back a few times. You will finish the zip line on Sentosa island after flying over the jungle, beach and water to arrival in a tiny island. Once finished, you will be offered to do another one half price ( deal When I did it last time) if you say yes, you will keep you equipment and Simeone will drive you back up. If not, enjoy the beach there is a great pizzeria next to the arrival. From there you can take free buses to go back or go anywhere else on this fun island ( public transport is the only free thing on Sentosa so enjoy ;-)).

The Three main roller coasters are the Red one: high speed classic roller coaster the blue one :for advanced crazy roller coasters lovers as you will go high speed and upside down several time) and the Mommy ( which is genuinely great but also scary). Universal studio shows are also very good!! The transformers is not too bad either. The few issues that you need to be aware:1- Fast track passes are key of happiness!!! Very Long line and Locals are used to queue so they are not afraid to wait for a full hour or more ( I can not!!).2- The food is very bad and Super $ anywhere In the park so avoid or bring your stuff however there is an air conditioned little food street area that is delicious and cheap 30 Sec walk from the park and other good (more expensive) restaurants. If you want to eat well I suggest you Get out for 30min and return. 3- More often than one of the two roller coasters blue or red are down for maintenance so better call before or ask before paying your ticket if you do not have an annual pass. If the weather is bad it is 100% guaranteed that they will stop the blue and red roller coasters as they are outside. For young kids also lots to do, shows, Elmo, puss in boots, Shrek, etc...Enjoy!

The Fox Theater is at a different level. Old and beautiful. Perfectly decorated with an inside ceiling that would compete with the best Theater ceilings in Paris, London and Rome create an ambiance that makes going there unique and magical. It is exciting to go there for the show but you will also look at the Theater! They do have tours by the way. Enjoy!
marriedplustwo|FE49B3994D9F0F406A2FC77416A7C1D7|Restaurant|Atlanta: Landmark Diner|3| “Cheap but not great”|review_481570707|This place is open 24 hours a day so depending on what time you go the crowd will be very different. I went a few times to please family and friends and rarely had a good meal. Quality of food is generally poor but the service at lunch time was very good. The place had been there for a while and it obvious but it also a part of the landscape and lots of people go there as an habit/ tradition. If you like good food there lots of better options in Atlanta. If you have to good there to please other people read carefully the menu and stick to the classic except for Chilli, It was mediocre.

Not so easy to access and the area frankly did not feel the safest. This is why it has moved I Guess. The ambiance in the stadium was what you expect of prof major league baseball and entertainment. Took kids there and had so much fun! Food is not great but you can survive with CFA :-) Homerun equals fireworks from big Coke bottle! So much fun!!! I have high hopes for the new stadium.

There is outside and inside sittings. Great place to do take away as well. Bon Appétit!
marriedplustwo|FE49B3994D9F0F406A2FC77416A7C1D7|Restaurant|Atlanta: 57th Fighter Group Restaurant|4| “2nd WW museum/ restaurant”|review_478091337|It is a museum and a restaurant. They have champagne brunch on Sunday and it is quite nice. The rest of the time you have access to a classic American menu with good quality food. Eating outside when the weather permit is a must as the restaurant is located on a smart private airport and you can watch small planes and jets taking off and landing but far enough for the fume or TOP much noise. The restaurant has museum jeeps, planes from WW2. During the weekend a a pilot can take you do a tour of Atlanta from the restaurant. We did it and it was great. It is such a unique place and great for kids. At night it is a bar and dancing club. Must try!
marriedplustwo|FE49B3994D9F0F406A2FC77416A7C1D7|Attractions|Austell: Six Flags Over Georgia|4| “So much fun!”|review_478090434|This place is very nice. Suggest you go in the morning as the evening it becomes more for teenagers/ young adults and therefore the ambiance changes a bit. There is entertainment for kids of all ages. My Son rode his first roller coaster there and he loved it. Fast pass can be very useful during busy days ( weekend and holidays) during the week it is not often crowded ( we went several times). Food quality still is an issue as most of it is fast food and over priced ( shame) but it is so much fun that you are willing to have a poor meal. Parking is big but be ready to walk a bit. Even with bus that takes you from parking to entrance you have to walk from the parking to get the bus. If you have people with limited mobility better drop them first then park later if you can.

They have healthy options, vegan menu, and also more classic western food. Specialties are flat bread and they bring a tray of small delicious deserts to take at the end. All is reasonably priced. Parking is not Super easy to find but it is okay. Service is good. Very nice place! Bon Appétit.

One of the few giant whales in captivity and you you can dive with them. Giant tank that you can watch for hours. Beluga whales are majestic. The rest is more classic but so much to see. The only issue is the poor quality of the food like most amusement Parks in the U.S. if you are a local better to get a membership since a single entry ticket price is high. Also avoid weekends and public holidays as it gets Very crowded.

Great ambiance, superb service. Food is delicious. You can stick to classic curry or experiment if you have the palate and the desire. It is not cheap but it is worth it. My ultimate Favourite is the lychee duck curry! Great place for celebrations and fancy dates. Enjoy!
marriedplustwo|FE49B3994D9F0F406A2FC77416A7C1D7|Restaurant|Singapore: Muchachos|3| “Nice casual Mexican place”|review_478078038|It does not open before noon during the week so be aware that you will wait if you get there early. This place has legit burritos and nice chicken tacos. I am still in the hunt for a great Fish taco for lunch and unfortunately this place is not it! They have everything for it except the fish is frozen type. Back to the good stuff. Great burritos but not cheap (11+ SGD). I find it disappointing that the chips ( not homemade) and guac are extras. To recap some things are good but in all a bit disappointing.

This is a first come first serve restaurant and after 13pm the line will start getting Long. Great menu starting at 10$ SGD. 6 nice side dishes that you can reorder at will. I like their BBQ food and according to my Korean Friend who lives a few blocks away it is the more authentic Korea food in this area. I trust her. A must try! Bon Appétit!

For local there is a huge display of food available ( Malaysian, Indonesian fusion). The Western option looks limited but I can not judge I never tried. The local option I had more a dozen times. It is good and it will cost 5 to 8 SGD for a big plate depending on what you take. Lots of spicy things in there so be careful if you do not like spicy and when they say it is spicy believe me it is!! Egg plants ( spicy) and non spicy chicken curry with Nasi rice are my favourite. Lots of outside sitting with fans. At night this place becomes a popular sports bar. Also if you eat alone there are TVs to watch. Enjoy!

The place is small but there is a few private rooms at the back which is nice for small groups. The menu is reasonable 20+SGD. Last I had was was the Tonkatsu box and it was genuine! Comes with homemade Japanese soup and egg dish all delicious. Service was okay but not outstanding. I would go back for sure. Bon Appétit!

Apparently Shin Kushiya was one of the first Japanese restaurants to introduce the kushiyaki dining concept in Singapore, where affordable, quality Japanese cuisine is served in an elegant setting. I would say it is true, the skewers are delicious, soup homemade. All come in one big tray with nice presentation. This is not a place specialised in Sushi so do not go there for Sushi cravings! Enjoy!

The Arab burger is Ma favorite, their lamb kebabs are good as well. There is a lunch menu at 20+ SGD which comes with homemade pita and a delicious homemade hummus. Not the best Greek in town but good for lunch.

Mix of tourist and business people. Best Chicken Tikka I had in Singapore. Copious portion and very reasonable prices! Been there many times and never had a bad experience. Please note it is outside sitting only. You Pay at the cash register at the center of the of the restaurant. Be careful they do not take many credit card types. I think Visa only or cash - better to check before otherwise there are cash machines in the his area (financial district of Singapore :-)). Enjoy!

It is MUCH more pleasant to access by the main road than back entrance which greets you with very stinky trash area. This Hawker Centre has a great mix of choices from Thai, Dim Sim decent Western, chicken rice, Noodles, it is difficult to go wrong. TIP: sit the closest to the main road in the open with fans it is the best location. Favourite food there is Thai place at the extreme left when you have you back to the main road. Bon Appetit!

Great location although easy to miss. You will have authentic Dim Sum, served quickly. The ambiance is food court so do not expect the fancy dim sum place but the Prices are also Low and you will be surrounded by locals :-) The staff does not speak good English but you just have to look at the menu and fill out your order. BBQ buns shrinks/pork Dim sum are incredible there. Be aware that in less than 10 min you will be freezing. This place seems to have the coolest aircon in Singapore so take a Jacket with you if you are sensitive to aircon or have small kids.Bathroom are small ( one person at a time and not great just FYI). I have been several time and will good back again! It is genuine and delicious!

You will not be disappointed here. Menu is good. Lots of classic small appetisers and then a main dish all tasty and spicy. I was a bit disappointed they did not offer to refill the small appetisers as they normally do in Korean restaurants. I took the chicken BBQ and it was very good although not served with rice which I found a bit disappointing. The quality was good and ratio quality price okay. No need to book for small parties. My colleague apparently loves this place. Service was also fast and efficient for a lunch so all in I will go back.

There is a big table but you need to be a group of people to book it. So you are having a dinner and a show watching people work (not ideal for romantic dates but doable). The people in the kitchen side are not super friendly, okay they are working but a bit too serious frankly.Cocktails: My Wife order one of the special cocktails and it was amazing, I took a simple G&T and could not taste the gin (disappointing for the price!)Food was very good (although too rich for my Wife, sauce with the meat etc...). For the high bill at the end and the average ambiance, the experience was not 'a must do again' for me but definitely worth a try for curious foodies who loves meat and willing to spend :-)

Pictureant|C2637038A322DE0280197943B7309BF9|Attractions|Cephalonia: Myrtos Beach|3| “Beautiful from Far but Far from Beautiful ..”|review_507184380|When we planned our trip to Myrtos, We as a family were very excited to see the place for ourselves what hundreds if not thousands have been raving about.Like when you search for Myrtos beach in Google, you'll find hundreds of photos that shows the beautifully triple tiered turquoise sea and powdery white sandy beach. Yes, you do see some amazing water color (it is btw), due to white stones/pebbles and yes you heard me right ,its not powdery sandy beach but white stones almost the size of turtle eggs, making it very difficult to walk on them and that's about it! This is where the joy and good feeling you have about this beach ends.This beach in my opinion is completely unorganized, no sunbed, no umbrellas, no deck chairs or anything you can hire, Nada!! no one actually looks after it from what i saw. I mean for a National Treasure for Kefalonia and a World renowned beach, you would think this would be Jewel of the Crown in terms of Beaches for Kefalonia. But even the makeshift of a Bar or Tavern was closed at the height of Summer in July 2017. I mean what more can I say.The sea itself, the color stays true to what I have seen , but its not family friendly especially if you have children or someone who cannot swim well, It drops very quickly in depth and there are strong undercurrents if you swim about 100m or further. And due to this reason , the sea itself is not clear, I personally snorkeled out to 200m from the shoreline and dived a couple of times to the seabed , but visibility was down to about 1.5 meters when I was lucky ,so if you are thinking you will see crystal clear waters with 10 meters clear visability , think again. For me the lack of basic facilities like an umbrella or sunbeds at the famous spot like Myrtos did take me by surprise, and there were hardly any shady spots given its location and the car park was a free fall mess, but luckily we got a great spot right under the cliff's shade just as someone was leaving , if not that would have been a pain as well. We originally planned to spend at least half a day there driving up from Argostoli and arriving about 11am, but due to the unbearable heat and the other above mentioned reasons, sadly,we moved on after an 1hr, after taking a few memorable shots and a quick dip. Having traveled around the whole island now I have to say Kefalonia has much better beaches with crystal clear waters, sand and with a much more family friendly atmosphere. Very disappointed overall hence my borderline 3/5, but for how it looks from the cliffs and the differing colors of the sea, its a stunning beach..For me this Beach rings in my favorite saying , "Beautiful from far , Far from Beautiful when you are near it." which sort of summarises everything i have said in a nutshell.

Having been to many theme parks all over the global , perhaps I was slightly disappointed with the overall size and coverage of the Park but overall it was very enjoyable to look around and take photos at the various attractions. My only negative would be the pricing as i felt it was slightly overpriced for what was being offered, but my local school friends did warn in my advance anyway so at least i knew i wasn't being overly critical as locals felt the same way, so if you are thinking of going buy the combination ticket to get some savings.
Pictureant|C2637038A322DE0280197943B7309BF9|Restaurant|Antalya: Oz Simsek Kofte Piyaz|2| “Very disappointed :-( Service and Quality have gone downhill since my last visit”|review_406608847|Having now been to Turkey over 20 times , I can honestly say , I can tell apart a good Lahmacun (Turkish Pizza) from a bad one and especially when I am very particular about the type of restaurants I visit, And considering my sister-in-law and father-in-law are locals to Antalya, I did not expect the staff at this restaurant to act the way they did. Having been around the city earlier, we were deciding on where to have sit down meal for the evening , We have been to this restaurant before and even though the food was not amazing , the service was good and timing and quality was never an issue, Having had a good experience before , we decided to pull up here for an early dinner.Firstly , the waiter /manager who served us perhaps did not wake up on the right side of the bed due his general mannerisms, but putting this aside , as my daughter was hungry , we insisted on her getting her Lahmacun out first and we were happy to wait for our respective dishes, Of course they got this back to front , everyone else was getting their dishes and my daughter was left waiting , after kicking up a minor fuss, out came her meal ,and as she was starving she started on it straight away ...But to my amazement, it was basically flour, tomatoes and salad spread on flaky base.. there was no sign of any well marinated garlic, onions or the generally well spread mince..My daughter was not bothered as she was hungry, but my sister-in-law who is Turkish and a local , agreed with me on the scantily clad Turkish pizza and raised this with the manager , who was the waiter as well incidently, apart from shrugging his shoulders, he went off with a disgusted look on his face, Now I said to my sister-in-law that if they were a reputable restaurant as before and having still some faith left in them that he might have gone off to get a replacement sent out. But to my amazement nothing of the sort happened , if anything ,another Lahmacun came out to another table across from us after our complaint and theirs was bulked with mince and all the required bits as we wanted, by this point I was fuming and as my daughter had finished her food and did not want me to get angry , I was not going to pay for her meal, but as my sister-in-law was paying for the meal , I told her to do the same.For one , they first billed her incorrectly and added 2 items on top, which we had to get corrected and then while we were about to drive off , we spotted another incorrect entry on the bill 2nd time around and she had to go back in and get this amended as well and refunded., So to summarise , I will never be going back there again , lousy service in comparison to general Turkish Standards, poor quality food, very dismal portions, and the customer is never right in their premises, and possibly fuelled by anger, they deliberately added stuff onto the bill hoping I would not spot it being a foreigner, who knows..With the recourse to the amount of Top class restaurants around the Lara area , this lot are asking to close down with this type of service.Suffice to say I will never be going back and if they do shut down due the bad staff and poor service, good riddance to bad rubbish.

And It's our second time in Sharm, and I personally hope , I get to return and spend more time around the hotel and Sharm as a whole , and if I get the chance, to go diving as i wanted to (due to a sinus issue I had to miss it this time around )  As we arrived at the airport this time around the Thomas Cook Rep , Sambook straightway recognized me, it had been 2 years since our last visit but clearly this is where the whole brilliant experience begins,, Customer services and giving the personal experience is what Baron is all about.We were escorted to nice small shuttle and within 20 mins we were at the hotel greeted by the welcoming staff and cool drinks. As we were returning , i had requested for the same room and amenities, and always top service and very smooth check in. All amenities in the room were good. We had a few minor issues which were all resolved immediately. All the Staff members are ready to help you with anything you have issues with and my personal favorites and restaurants were:Sinai - Breakfast with endless varieties to choose from and Mo (head waiter) and Mohammed (always playing with my daughter and very professional even got a photobomb moment with him).Egyptian - Loved the lady and the staff, Very tasty fish and shish dishes and even have turkish coffee, which my wife loved being turkish. I was so full , I had to literally roll back to my room.Italian - Samir and Omar and chefs (Very polite, friendly and tailored a pasta dish for me...) 5/5 for your superb rendition of spaghetti aglio e olio with fresh seafood..Brilliant.Indian - Being Singaporean and of Indian ethnicity, the question of whether i would like a dish extra spicy always comes up when i am in a restaurant overseas, Personally I don't like it too spicy, when you cannot taste the dish anymore, but tolerance levels are based on what you have eaten before, So when the Manager asked me whether i liked it extra hot , i told him to give it his best shot ,just to assess the range. But in comparison to all the middle eastern countries i have been to , they excelled at getting it really spicy if you wanted to it. And from authentic point of view, it was a very good rendition of a chicken briyiani, very close to the ones I have eaten in India and Asia in general. So 5/5 from me. Given I don't think they do seem many Singaporeans in Egypt so I was among the rarity to give my 2 cents worth :-).Seafood - Abdullah (you were my daughter's favourite) and I must say this is one of the top restaurants to go to either for Dinner or for a lunch time fajita. So definitely not one to be missed.Guest relations - Olesya, Maria & Katya - Always helpful friendly and had lovely smile whenever I met them and chatted with them. These girls have pearls of wisdom and customer service oozing from them, again an asset to the Baron Organisation I would say.LifeGuards - Top man Amir and Hamid and few others who basically were with us through our entire stay at the Baron Beach, considering how we were at our regular spot at the beach and the drop off the entire time, I personally got to know them very well past, present and future. Chefs - Big mo and little mo. (Sinai) all very friendly and accommodatingAnd All the gardeners who gave lovely flowers to my wife and daughter and looked after the gardens from before sunrise to after sunset.All the staff work incredibly hard especially in that heat and these stood out for me and deserve a remuneration of some kind, as they are the backbone of this hotel , without them , I feel the Baron will just be just another hotel in Sharm and speaking to various others who stayed at other hotels in the vicinity , I felt this was clearly obvious.Considering the Positives the negatives almost self eradicated themselves and during our Evening Reception with Management I highlighted these to the GM - Abdul Hamid Ahmed, a simply astounding man with great personalty and management charisma.If anything his own customer service ethic simply rolls through to all his staff from what i could see, and if it didn't reach certain individuals he made sure they understood what was required to achieve this.To give a small example, I highlighted the issue of the disparate lack of signal Wifi issue that spanned the Hotel grounds, which he got resolved personally for me by him by the next day and he even tested it with me while we were dining at the Taj Mahal. :-)Now this is the type of customer service, that many hotels can take a role model from. And I personally found this man very humble and delight to talk to, I am a people person and anything to make the staff's working life better , I highlighted to him and even though i was not teaching the man how to run his own hotel, he was very kind to receive every kind of feedback so that he could make it better.And this I feel is the reason why families like myself are eager to return to the Baron. If anything my only real issue was the watersports guys selling around the pool and beach Beware! it seems from what i was told, the Dolphin excursion was not as it seems from what i heard and I did mention this in my feedback as there should be more tours operated by the Hotel directly and not some of these free lancers who seem to cut through when they get a chance..Overall We had such a wonderful and superb holiday and I would definitely return, shame about my illness which lingered through, but I still made the most of it and everyone at the Baron helped towards my recovery and have made a dozen of Facebook , WhatsApp and Instagram friends, just to keep in touch and see how their lives span out and if given the opportunity if any of the staff who made this a wonderful holiday needed my help in the future..I would not hesitate for one moment.. Well done everyone , look forward to seeing you again in the near future.

It was my second time, but this time I hope Espa has a big pool where yiu can swim as well with a just the right warm temperature not really as hot as the onsen they offer. Could be a bigger pool you want to take a plunge and swim a little while waiting for the treatment. Reservation need to be really advance, even in one month is very full.

Upon entering the room , it seems clean at first because the color of the room and facing a huge window on a bright sunny day makes it bright and clear. The moment I pulled out the first cover ( duvet) of bed I saw the bed sheet stained! SomeBrownish color. So i called for help to change all the sheets. Guy came speaking in Chinese then I said " I can't understand sorry " he continues to speak in Chinese then i just keep pointing to the bed calmly specifically to the stain so he can understand me, then he went out and came back for another assistant and changed all the sheets. Then I went inside the toilet checked the shower area seems not even cleaned after use. The hand towels are also stained with make-up ( somewhat an eyeliner stain) ! So it was clear that the toilet was not inspected well if it was a left unsanitized. Then the auntie, the other assistant mentioned that there is a problem with washing the sheets and towels that is why it is still stained and she said she will escalate the issue. Then i just kept nodding whileShe keeps talking but the truth is i felt disappointed with so many flaws in this room. Then after they finished, later on the guy came back with cleaning materials, speaking in Chinese again pointing at the toilet, then I let him in, so what he did was he cleaned up the floor in the shower and showing me that he is cleaning it now and trying to have it sanitizedWith chlorox because I can practically smell and poured onnthe floor. Soni just kept quiet and just waited for him to finish. Then he went out. Overall, not really happy.

I checked in during my birthday week and I have no idea of what the hotel can offer except that I can only see a posh picture of the suite rooms in the hotel. surprisingly Christine the staff who assisted me from check in to serving whatever I need , to making sure I am satisfied to my comfort, her service is first class. very friendly, helpful, service oriented and most of all very sincere. I hope all hotel staff are like her, because of her I am willing to come back to his hotel and it is highly recommended. talking about their amenities, it was quality and they serve soap and other toiletries used by espa which is a world class spa in Singapore which I have been to and experienced. the place is very private and if you are looking for a peace and quiet this is the right hotel to stay. you will feel special and most of all best service. I commend Christine for being one of their staff who gives invaluable service and first class.also not to mention that Crockford is very near all the theme park and luxury stores that I don't need to go somewhere to have fun. I am really enjoying sentosa now because of this kind of hotel stay experience.

When i reach universal studios - i see a huge queue.It was really crowded on tuesday that was not holiday - but still. I upgraded the ticket with express pass for $50 SGD per ticket - that is steep; but it helped me cover all the activities. After i entered, we had huge rain pouring for 2 hours!! I am eternal optimist! - still i had loads of fun even with all glitches. I ensured crowd and weather never got in way of having fun with my family. So you can do it too!For vegetarians like, you need to go near Egypt restaurant for veg food - very limited options elsewhere.

BTW they make good Kahwah(Kashmiri tea) -do try.Note the drop/pickup from ban ganga is complimentary by the hotel. But the trip to helipad cost Rs 150/- one way.For those who are concerned about wifi; wifi is available in lobby area only. There are no repeaters in the room for wifi reception.

But i happened to visit because of a friend staying in Bellary. It was definitely worth it. Very different from the other historical places - the caves really amaze you and makes you feel wow! Guide is a must - otherwise you will miss a lot of obvious good things. You can visit by staying in Hubbali or Bellary. To eat you can go to a Mayura KSTDC restaurant close by. Crowd in Mayura will be a bit awkward for family, because of alcohol drinking people - however they are well behaved - keep to themselves. So I did not have problem taking my family there.

Had been to the temple in the evening, actually got an opportunity to see the lord twice. Since it was less crowded in evening on a weekday. If you have kids the elephants by the side of the temple are a good watch for them. People offer donations in form of bananas to these pachyderms. Also, do not miss out the the way 'Gandha' is made in a mechanical way in large quantities by the people who work in the temple. Those guys have stamina!

The room,food and ambience are very good. The best part about this place is how they treat you - very good courteous/pragamatic staff. They went out of way in two scenarios .... - my daughter wanted a soup made even though it was not on menu. they did it on request from a 4 yr old. I did not even ask.- we had time till evening to catch the train. Check-out time was 12 noon. However, the staff was pragmatic and let us use the room till 3.30 pm by which time next set of travelers were expected to arrive. This was a big relief for our family.I definitely will go back to this hotel and i recommend others the same.

Sunday was only buffet reasonably priced with mocktail, grilled starters, main course and range of puddings. I must admit the pudding section is too tempting for kids. Service charges and tax extra that would round up Rs.2000 (2 adult,1 young child)Advance table booking is recommended, the staff were courteous,needed a prompt for the cutlery.Just a minute suggestion. Ambience scores really high especially with kids at least for the first time.The rest room were clean,yes I score a restaurant's cleanliness from the restroom too.Just to bust the suspense bubble 'cold canon balls ' is nothing but pan ice cream. Nevertheless had a good time and it was worth it. Keep it up pirates.

I was also given a Club room without even asking, and the staff were exceptionally helpful and courteous. They also give you a Handy phone to use during your stay, which I have never got at any other hotel before. I would definitely like to stay here again.

I stayed the next day at Grand Park Orchard which is just opposite, and discovered that I had left my shoes behind. When I called Housekeeping, they asked me to come in half an hour to collect my shoes, and I got them in a lovely pink bag with pink ribbons, which was a very nice gesture. I will definitely stay at the Mandarin Orchard again.

The staff are amazing and the whole place screams luxury! The rooftop pool has a great view over the city and is big enough. My room was really comfy and even had a foot relaxing wash and bowl which along with a view (and shower) that had an amazing view of the city. The breakfast had amazing choice with hot and continental available in unlimited amounts. There are lots of bus stops around so it is really easy to get everywhere and the airport is only 40 mins maximum by bus. In the rooms they also give you a device to take out with you that gives you calls and interned for free which is really useful!

It is possible to do it all in 3 hours (to get the last duck and hippo bus back). A great idea and the fire show at the beginning was a nice surprise.

There were long queues but as I was alone I could use the single rider line which saved me a load of time! The water show however was the highlight and yes you will get soaked if you sit in the blue bit... unfortunately the parade was cancelled as they thought it was going to rain (though in the end it didn't) and as I went on a weekend they put on fireworks on the lake which is a nice way to end. What was really nice was that when I left after the fireworks there wasn't a huge queue for the cable car which Iexpected....

The length of Singapore that can be travelled with a ticket is great so if you don't want to do the tourist bit of sentosa you can go to the other parts for walks. I like how it comes alongside the sentosa merlion which is awesome in the dark!

There are beautiful flowers and statues everywhere. The only think that I could mark down was it is just so busy.... I went later in the day before the light show and I think everyone else had the same idea. It was too busy for me to properly enjoy but I still did see how beautiful it was.

I should also add that I am not a huge fan of going up tall buildings to see the view as have done it an awful lot...

I just thought it would be more environmentally friendly and would have more nature but the trees themselves are beautiful so still go and see

When I was in the flower conservatory it was just really busy whereas this allows for a more spacious trip. I loved being up high and walking down with the flowers and waterfall. The video on conservation really hits home as well.

However it is like nothing I have ever seen and I am very glad I went. The only thing that I could say against it- apart from it needing new paint in places- is that the legends it depicts aren't very well explained and I ended up looking up a lot of them online to understand the stories.

The walk up isn't too bad I just didn't like that the rocks could be slippy in places and there is no rope. The view from the top would have been lovely if the mozzies weren't so be that everyone was getting to the top and promptly returning to the bottom.... I wouldn't say I felt safe walking but mostly because I was alone though you were always meeting people on the way down...

There was a bit of a delay to get in but that was ok- everyone just waits on the bridge outside. The library is disappointing but the other 2 (particularly the ball room) were the rooms to eat in!....

Excellent friendly staff, clean inside and out. good choice of food at buffet breakfast. Nice pool with lifeguards and hotel right beside beach. Nice touch is the free bus service to the shopping mall where you can catch the underground or walk down the hill and catch the free bus to the water park/Universal park and shops. My only complaint is that the buffet dinner is a different price each night and very expensive if you are a family. Other than that an excellent, clean and friendly hotel.
mikemiddler1|950A14FE1DA1CB756CCCEA89033C3F1F|Hotel|Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia: Mount Lavinia Hotel|2| “Poor hotel”|review_460911541|When you walk into reception you think, very nice 5 star hotel, but when you go to your room you think 2 star just. Paint was falling off of the walls in the room and bathroom, the corridors were in need of a paint also. The shower was a disgrace, the shower tray was heavily stained with black scratch marks, the shower doors were black at the bottom and filthy and also black between the shower tray and tiles. If you have the misfortune to stay in this hotel make sure you do not have a room on the other side of the courtyard from reception as this hotel is built VERY close to a main railway line which runs right underneath the rooms. There is a station about 100 mts from the hotel and all you hear all day is the train horns as they leave the station starting at least 05.00 in the morning. One good thing is the choice of food is good but if eating on the outside tables the hotel allows smoking when other guests are eating, disgusting. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone but if you are with a tour you might not have a choice.

The bathroom and shower area are large with a wetroom that is half indoors and half outdoors and also has a large window looking out to the sea and any wildlife that decides to pass by. The outdoor dining area is excellent and the food, buffet, was excellent with a good choice of food. Staff are excellent and I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wishes to stay in that area.

The room I was given had a smell of damp, room however was clean and tidy. No a/c but had a heater. Grounds were kept very nice and tidy. Meals were also very good with a large selection to suit every ones taste. Because of the type of building the rooms had wooden floors and it was quite noisy from the rooms above and also when guests walked along the corridors.

You stay in semi-detached cottages in large garden area. Walk from reception/restaurant to rooms is across an area of slabs with spaces in between them and at night there is not a lot of lighting so could be a trip hazard. Cottage interior could be done with a fresh coat of paint and there were a couple of loose floor tiles, but the room and bedding was clean and the food was good and plenty of choice. The staff were excellent and friendly.

Great lodge with thatched roof and wonderful log fire and underfloor heating also the outdoor shower. Great game drives with Jano who could have a laugh with you. Everyone of the staff were brilliant and the food was out of this world, we even had real South African entertainment one night from all of the staff which was great. Nothing was to much for the staff who went out of their way to help. Monkeys were in the trees and wildlife came down to the waterhole in front of the pool terrace. The owners deserve praise too for the way the lodges are spaced out and the overall feel to the place. Would definitely recommend this lodge, Bukela, to anyone.

The reception is in the middle of nowhere, at least a 15 minute walk from some rooms. The rooms were very small, good air conditioning but bathroom was very hot, so hot you had to go to the room to dry yourself. The small pool beside the restaurant was full of leaves and small branches and the main pool was further away then the reception. My room was very clean so no problem there. Restaurant was very nice and food OK but be warned, watch out for the monkeys as they are very clever and wait for the restaurant staff to move away then sneak in and steel food off of your plate, even if you are sitting at the table.

Service representative , did loads of work of finding drink as it is not very common in Ireland as I noticed and on top of Martini added even Strawberries.Communication was great and amazing and staff helped me a lot about everything.Arrival and checking in - Fast and brilliant. Receptionist checked us in , took deposit and took us to apartments and explained everything again , just to be sure on everything. Check out times, how tv works, how oven work and so on.Location - just perfect. 10min walk to Gardens of Rememberance or O'Connell street which takes u to river in around ~5-8minutes. Tesco store is as well just barelly 10-12min away, which makes you to save a lot of money , by just cooking it in your studio instead of going eat out all time. Only problem I encountered was, after too long shower time, a bit colder water appeared, which I assume is related to "peak" showering time in the evening. But just turn up more hot water and all is just perfect.So this is the part where I must say it - If you book them , take Studios for 2 people or better ! They do have oven, microwave, kettle, tv with Virgin Entertainment box, wifi and even dishes and frying pans etc. It makes you feel like at home. And price difference is really small. Please be advised - Cleaner is coming by the papers every 7th day, but we had it 2 times within 6 days. So, if you have expectancy as of 5 star hotel, you should check on with reception desk before making assumptions.Other than that - Totally recommend and If i am about to return to Dublin, this is the place I will come back without any hesitation.

Very quiet around, friendly staff and in my opinion location was just brilliant. With 45min foot walk in average speed to Marina Bay Sands or 10min walk to the nearest MRT station. Over week days it was quiet and empty, yet on weekend it was noticable that loads of locals or malaysians come for staycation as it offers affordable rooms with tv and air conditioner with great view over the city (if u are on the right side) + outdoors pool. TV was working nicely and actually as someone who doesnt watch it I found it quite entertaining over evenings before sleep.Staff was extra friendly and didnt mind us calling them every hour or two one day for extra tea, ironing desk and other stuff we just felt we would need. Towels, robes, sheets were changed every day.Dont see anything wrong with it. Beds however were a bit more nicer years ago as I understood from Girlfriend, but well , they were huge and comfy so its alright

Appetizers, main and deserts. Dont get me wrong - they dont give you plate with food and try to scramble it clean, but they do their own system , which simplicity amazed me and I would never be able to think of that on my own, which makes it so easy to eat in dark and not getting dirty.I would recommend in going there with 4 people group. It is fun for a couple, but 4 lady group next to us had a blast and even we were laughing and joinign in conversation as this dinner is not just siitting and eating, but exchanging experience, trying to guess what you eating and just having a laugh.At the end of dinner, you are going to be shown what you ate and you can compare to what you thought it was.

With Fast pass it took still all day to get through everything and you definitely save quite a lot of time of not queuing up too much. Just for example - Jurrasic park ride (fast pass queue - 15min , normal 2h 35min). Attractions are amazing. Most of them would suit kids, but much fun for adults. Transformers is a must for any 3D enthuasist ! It was just lifechanging experience for me in theme parks ! Now i can never look back at other attractions after visiting it. On the other side - I must say , everything seemed quite cheap and affordable, but food however wasnt the best one in the dinner they had.

Didnt expect much from order, but as my Nachos arrived I was daaamn happy I didnt order that all alone. With quite a lot of jalapenos on side, perfectly melted cheese over the top and salsa with sour cream added on the dish. It was delicious. For one person might be too much, but due to us being 2 , it was just perfect for starter. Finished with starter and we got served our food. Ive eaten fish and chips in quite a lot of places, as its like Must-have for visiting Brighton. Let me say it this way - size of the dish exceeded my expectations. Fish was HUGE. Might be a bit too oily for some people, but I loved it. It was something I fancied for loong time. Perfectly done. Some sallads on side and hand cut potatoes on side was all I needed for finishing it. Potatoes could be bit more, but it was fineIn overall - had amazing experience. Prices was average pub prices, but quality was over any other pub I've been before. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a nice lunch / dinner with friends or family.

Stayed with my wife and 1.5 year old, so it was a bit awkward when we saw that there is a Hooter's right at the entrance! But I guess its Bangkok. The breakfast spread is a little limited if you are Muslim, you'll have to make do with the fruits and bakeries which are quite nice. The service is very good. We requested a prayer mat which took some time explaining, but once they did understand; managed one very quickly. Also the ever smiling concierge guy is super resourceful (he clearly has the best English among all the staff!), rented us a car on the evening for the next morning.

Specially, millions of long tail boats cover the beach so you really dont get much of a view from the beach. Probably, off season is a good idea. BUT, it all changes at night. The sunset from the boat is breathtaking, and the swimming experience after dark is out of this world. There are just millions of planktons in the water; and when you move your hand and feet, they just suddenly light up all around you...like you are swimming through a starry night sky...truly amazing experience

The room was very neat including the rest room.The host was very humble. He started calling us in the evening whether we will reach on time and whether we needed any assistance. They were very friendly and suggested few places for our trip the next day also. Food - We simply loved the coffee offered by them :) We asked them to prepare lunch for us and the food was very tasty and homely. Also, the food offered was of very minimal cost. If you have your water bottle, they fill your bottle also with purified water. :) Thanks to the cook aunty. She made us very convenient.

At times, you are lucky enough, you will be above the clouds when the flyer reaches its top most position.Also, the area in the flyer is a must visit. They have a nice park surrounding the flyer with the river view.I would say, after completing the flyer ride, you can take a walk around the flyer area for getting a beautiful view of Marina Bay Sands, Singapore River. You can take a lot of nice pictures at this background.

Gardens by the bay consists of a flower dome, sky forest, a lake and super tree grove. It is also at a walkable distance to Marina Bay Sands, its mall and casino.Take your own time to enjoy all the four attractions in Gardens at the bay. Worth spending complete evening enjoying all the attractions.

Aquarium|4| “A very place for kids”|review_481277979|We loved the way the fishes, sharks and dolphins were maintained.It is a good place for the kids to explore different kinds of fishes.The way the aquarium is built for the fishes and the light settings is just awesome.
Revathi_Murali|4693FA1725598A23A67EB4918CDAEEED|Attractions|Sentosa Island: The Sentosa Bus|5| “Free convenient transport”|review_481276665|The bus service is for free and it takes you to any place in sentosa.Note the bus timings though, as you may need to wait for sometime.They even explain in detail about the attractions accessible from the particular bus stop so that it is easy for the passengers. The driver is very friendly and he also helps us in case we don't know our stops.
Revathi_Murali|4693FA1725598A23A67EB4918CDAEEED|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|4| “Perfect place to spend a day in Sentosa”|review_481275579|This is a must visit place for all the age groups if you are in Sentosa.Few recommendations out of our visit would be,1. Go on time - 9AM, they open the gates, be present when they open the gates, so that you can atleast goto few attractions without much queue2. Take the map present in the entrance gate. It has a detailed explanation on the rides along with the age groups applicable. Spend some time and read the map carefully. So that you can decide upon which ride to take and which ones to skip3. Few shows here happen only on specific timings, so plan accordingly, if you want to see them.4. There are a lot of lockers available across the attractions. The locker available with "Revenge of the Mummy" is free for 45 minutes and then the charges start applying for every hour. But the locker available with "Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure" is charged from the first hour itself. So, think before using lockers. 5. Have some 2 dollar change in your own packets if you are dropping your luggage in lockers. The locker does not return you change, if you pay in excess. Have always dollars in multiples of 2 to avoid excess payment.6. Once you enter Universal Studio, decide whether you want to go in clockwise direction or anti-clockwise direction. Once you start a ride in a particular direction, do not change sides. It will waste your time. 7. Do not miss the Transformers ride - it is the best in the lot. Also, please go for Jurassic Park ride, Mummy's ride and the water show organized by stunt people. If you want to skip the lines and go fast for the rides, you can take express tickets. This place is crowded all round the year. so be prepared to stand in the queue for over an hour, if you get into the above mentioned rides late in the day. Food is available inside universal studios, which we felt was a little costly.

Worth every penny spent.You will be left in wonder of how they are using water to create such a sheer magic for some 20 minutes. The sounds, lights and fireworks are so much co-ordinated and will leave you thrilled.We need to be present 45 minutes before the show timing to occupy the center seats to experience the show.

We found this oasis, on that small lane :) :) The food was mouth watering may be because we were without good food for 2 days.The Adai served was exactly the same we would get in Tamil Nadu :) :) We had their dosa, Idli. We also had their lunch the next day. I would say, the best served meal. So tasty the meal was, that we had a clean plate.I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to have authentic tamil nadu vegetarian food in Singapore.They are very cheap compared to other hotels.

This hotel provides tasty Indian food items at a very cheaper rate. It is located in the heart of little india and is always crowded. You need to wait for sometime to get a seat. But, the food was very tasty and worth every penny.

The rooms were very neat. Staffs are very helpful. Their breakfast is perfect for a Indian Menu :) :) . They provide free WiFi also :) :) You need to get the coupon from hotel reception for the WiFi password. They have a neat lobby with rest room facility where you can stay even after check-out till your flight time. The hotel was also situated at a walkable distance to Little India, Mustafa Shopping Mall. We were walking down for all our dinner and lunch. Also, there is a 24/7 store next to the hotel. Anything needy, it was easy for us to buy it from the close by store. We felt, a small wardrobe could have been provided in the room. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a very decent budget stay.

Though we booked few hours before, they were courteous in alloting a place for us after a small wait. We were enjoying the place during our wait for a table. The beach was so close and there were few tables close to the beach also. You can hear the sound of waves from the dining area. It is such a pleasant experience. I will rate this place a five on five.Coming to food, though veg people had their usual limited options, I could see a lot of non-veg items being placed. It was a tasty food but we felt the cost was on a higher side. Overall this place is recommended for a romantic dinner or dinner with friends. You will thoroughly enjoy.

Very Very close to East temple gate. You stay very close to Lord Narataja and the feeling that you can visit the temple anytime is truly wonderful. You step out of the hotel and in 10-15 seconds you are inside temple :) :) :) :) 2. Our room - Room No. 201 was quite big and we were comfortable3. AC's and Fan in perfect condition4. Hot water was available all through the dayCons:1. Blanket given was not lengthy. Very short.2. People working in the hotel including the person sitting in the reception were asking for TIPS for no reason. The cleaner never visited our room but still was asking for money. A big MINUS for the hotel being in the most prime location

It is well maintained also.Crowd is also less compared to Marina Beach.Neat pathways are provided for walking on either side of the road.As this place gets crowded quickly during weekends, parking will be a problem if we arrive late.

Person who was supposed to take order was totally dis-oriented as he was not knowing how to manage so many tables. The waiter's serving plate was already filled with left overs of previous orders. Our plates got mixed with the above said dirt.They took a terribly long time to deliver our order.We dint imagine that we will receive this treatment entering into Saravana Bhavan. We would not recommend this. There are better choices like Sangeetha and Newly opened Vasantha Bhavan Branch

We called room service as we had dirtied the room with beach sands at night 10.30 but there was no slight hesitation from the hotel staff. They had cleaned it neatly.The complimentary breakfast was very good with many options, though the coffee could have been hotter.WiFi connectivity is also present with good speed. We need to get login details from Reception.Overall, everything was neat in the hotel. Would surely recommend for others.

This zoo is spread out in a huge area which means you have to walk a lot. Thanks to the zoo management, they have provided small sit outs at frequent points so that you can take rest for sometime.Also, we were surprised by the shelters that were provided at the place where people will watch animals. Place is so clean and tidy. We were extremely happy on seeing the space allocated to each animal. It was quite a huge area allocated.Some things to note down:1. Plastic water bottle(Not tupperware kind of bottles but bottles like Aquafina, Kinley, etc) is allowed inside at a rate of Rs.10/- which can be collected back while coming out of the Zoo.2. No Plastic snack item is allowed inside. If you are carrying any packeted chips items like lays, the zoo employees will remove the items and put it in a paper cover and give it to you. Amazing move, which will avoid plastic inside the zoo.3. We found one small ice cream parlour almost after crossing more than half a distance. There is also a zoo canteen available which sells decent food at a nominal rate.4. Rest rooms are present inside the zoo. They also have mother-baby room at many points.Overall, one day can be well spent with the family in the zoo. We loved the giraffe's in the zoo. They have also kept small pluck cards mentioning who has adopted the animals for how many years. On leaving the zoo, you may also get a feeling to apopt a animal :) :)

There was this only mountain which hosts tea plantation. With Sikkim being "India's first organic State", we were still more curious to see this place. None of the other mountains here has a tea plantation in it which boasts it excellence further.The gardens were very neatly maintained allowing us to walk through and have a closer look. We also got a lot of temi tea packets of different varieties from the shops nearby. The prices are all fixed and no discount is being offered even you buy tea in huge quantity. Must visit, I would say.

A lady in the shop placed at Tashi View Point showed a picture of how the view will be through a photo.Don't buy anything from the shop placed there. We felt it was costly. The same items are available in Lal Bazar and MG Marg for a much little price

Due to some sectarian violence, there was security outside and you are supposed to show your photo ID card for an entry inside.After the entry has been granted, it is around a 500m steep walk to reach the monastery. For elderly people, the security staff were allowing them to reach the monastery without walking. Upon reaching the Monastery again you have to undergo security check. The monastery is huge, well built. Photography is prohibited inside the monastery. You also get pleasant views of the mountains.There is also a Golden Stupa of 16th Karampa for which you have to take a different route after entering the monastery. Again, Photography is prohibited inside for obvious reasons.There are a set of bells inside the monastery premises which you can turn. Also there are also set of bells on the way to the monastery. Remember that you have to turn bells in clockwise direction.There are also a lot of shops selling decorative items and a small restaurant on the way to the monastery.

There is a small shop that sells few decorative items here but we felt it was costly.It is a very calm and cool place. There is a little big shopping place outside the temple.

One portion of this place contains items that were used by the tibet people in olden days. You also get to see how the carpets, paintings are made actually and how much efforts people pitch in to make everything.When we went inside the painting section, we were actually dumbstruck by the paintings that were being made. So detailed and So creative paintings of Buddhist culture.

This place is huge with a river flowing in between. This valley is surrounded by huge snow clad mountains on both the sides. You have to walk down a tad bit to reach the river shore. But I bet, it is worth reaching the river and experience the peace. When we went, there were no flowers seen as our driver told that flowers will blossom in April/May and this place will look more beautiful.Much to our complete surprise and excitement, we saw snow fall. :) :) :) :) We were jumping with sheer joy. We started clicking pictures immediately. We felt that we were gifted to see snow fall in such a picturesque place. Dont forget to visit the Shiv Mandir in between Zero Point and Yumthang Valley which is maintained by Army Veterans. They were very happy to see some people visiting them. We were equally thrilled to meet them and have a chat with them. They greeted us very warmly and even provided hot water. We felt humbled by the hosts. We got prasadhams also from the temple :) :) There are a lot of small stalls present which sells Momos, Tea, Maggi.One important thing to note - There was restroom for both gents and ladies which was very very poorly maintained. You cant even step inside the place. The only disappointment for all the people who visited this place. We felt something can be done to maintain it well.

Not sure, whether they shut on all thursdays.We liked the place quite a bit as you can bargain with the shop keepers and we felt there are a lot of shopping options in Lal Bazar for Crockery. This place contains electronics shops too along with mid ranged restaurants.
Revathi_Murali|4693FA1725598A23A67EB4918CDAEEED|Attractions|Gangtok: MG Marg|5| “Unpolluted dirtless street - The place for shopping”|review_352265849|First time, we are been to a street which has all green buildings, no vehicles allowed, ample dustbins, lots of sitting place and most importantly the pleasant splendid display of colorful flowers in the street.We have never seen so many colorful varieties flowers preserved so fresh in a street till now. A big salute to the people who maintain these flowers. This street is maintained clean and neat though it is crowded most of the times. It hosts a lot of shops and you can find anything and everything here. Starting from household stuffs to restaurants to garments shop to carpets shops to tea packets selling shops to the special mention - MOMOS shops.You cant bargain anything here as they are all fixed price. All the shops shut at around 8-8.30PM and you will feel all the shops are closed before 9PM except for the restaurants. So, if you want to purchase anything, plan well before atleast try to be in the marg at around 6.30 to 7PM so that you will get some time to choose, pick and take.We went to Anand Stores for buying winter wear for our family. Though the shop looked crowded from outside, it is much empty if you get inside the shop. You can patiently look for designs there. We felt all the garment shops are having the same quality and the same price also. We loved sitting in the street and enjoying the serenity.

We had a overnight stay in Lachung so that we could start early for Zero Point.We started at around 6AM in the morning.Though we felt, we could gave given some more time considering the climate. But, I bet, it was the best experience we had till now. As we started early, we were not disturbed by other cars. The route from La Chung to Zero Point is beautiful and the roads are filled with snow. As we started early, we had a pit stop in Yumthang for breakfast. Before other people could reach for breakfast, we finished our breakfast and then we proceeded to Zero Point. Your eyes will not even blink on its way to Zero Point :) :) Believe Me. You will be truly dumbstruck by the natural beauty of this place with trees filled with Snows.We felt joyous when we were the first people to reach the zero point. So before all the other crowd could join us, we had some private time playing in the snow and taking loads of pictures. Tips:1. Start as early as possible from La Chung2. Have warm jackets along with boots (we rented boots for Rs.50)3. Have proper breakfast before reaching zero point4. Small pet shops will be set up in Zero Point which sells tea, coffee, maggi5. Keep walking in Zero Point so that the leg doesn't feel much pain due to cold6. It is windy there and keep ear cuffs also with you, if you are new to low temperatures.

You could also see different postures, colors of Buddha Statue placed inside the temple.There is a cafetaria inside the Buddha Park which sells fast foods like Momos(they were really tasty and fresh.. we tried it).Lot of flowers are present in the garden which makes the park more beautiful. You could see a lot of bees hovering over the flowers(Means - Flowers are very fresh)Surrounding scenic beauty adds to the park. You will wonder of how it was constructed in this high mountains.

We went to this lake after visiting Nathula Pass. Such a calm peaceful lake with beautiful waterbody.We visited this lake on 25th Februray, 2016. Lake was clear and only a small portion was filled with ice. There were a lot of Yaks available for a ride close by to the lake. We dint use it as we wanted to walk and experience the lake. There were a lot of snow deposited on the sides of the path were people started playing.It was written that it is a holy lake and believing that we took some water from the lake. Awesome place to take a lot of pictures Must visit while you are going to sikkim.Usually, it will be clubbed with Nathula Pass.

Though we were unable to click pictures around 500 mtrs near to this place (An army person was clearing the place) and no car was allowed to park closer to the pass(May be for security reasons), it was a nice feel.To see the Indian army protecting the borders where there is NO signal, no access to internet, no link to communicate with their family, you get goosebumps. We were treated warmly by the Army persons there. They were quite patient in answering all our queries , though the questions were repeated with different set of crowds. We also got to meet the Chinese army people :)Though we were not allowed to take pictures, the chinese army were taking pictures of us :D :DThere is a small canteen very close by (which sells Momos, of course) and also you get to buy a certificate that you have visited Nathula Pass :) :)You get a different feeling when you see the Gates of India and China along with the mountains in the Chinese side. We got to know from one of the army person that one of the mountain which we can see on the chinese side belonged to Bhutan :) :) En-Route to the trip is also very beautiful

It was a walkable distance for us.Being a south indian, I was in awe to eat dosa in this place and it turned out to be very good. The service is a little slow but the taste is very good. It is one of the very few good veg restaurants in MG Marg.

Not a single day, there was a less of service or less of hospitality. Mr.Pintu and his team were very kind towards us and they took care of us excellently.Right from the person, who was sent to receive us from the airport and till we were dropped back in the airport, we were treated with such warmth and were taken care extremely.We got a excellent room (Room No.201) with a fantastic view. Room service was very great. Anything you order, it will get delivered in 15-20 minutes. My husband loved the Masala Omlet, they prepared(Me being a vegetarian). We both loved their Veg Pakodas - Hot hot, garam garam :) :) (Must try, I would say)Best part of their hotel is the separate heater they provided in the bathroom. Unlike many hotels, where they have a common heater, you get a separate heater.There is also a electric water kettle in the room. They also provide extra pillows and extra blankets. The carpets in the room were also very thick. One small thing which we wanted was tissue in the rest room. They planned our trip very neatly and all the drivers they arranged were so nice towards us. They made us so comfortable all through our journey and made sure they stopped for lunch and other snacks.Overall, our trip was made most convenient and comfortable with a hassle free transfer with Mr.Pintu and his team. Would definitely recommend.Some tips:1. Carry a pair of bathroom slippers as the floor is too chill2. Carry tissue if you want3. Water bottles are provided in the hotel4. Take a hair dryer if you regularly use. Also, as the climate is low, i feel it is needed.5. Towels are provided in the room - Thick ones :)

So the buffet was closed and we had to go for Ala-Carte. The service was pretty fast and the food tasted good to our surprise.People in the hotel were very kind patiently listening to all our needs and even made small alterations according to our preferences.We ordered Ginger Chicken Wings which was served hot-hot with a small heating vessel below which kept the food hot amidst the cold temperature.Price is very reasonable though the place is little small.

Not even water bottle. So do carry your own stuffs and pack your bags with snacks if you are going with kids.If you have visited Kodaikanal Park, it is almost the same except that it has a separate kids play area and a small lake for which boat facility is available.The park is well maintained and there are a lot of small benches provided.We can spend time sitting and enjoying with family/friends/dear ones.This park is filled with photographers who take you around the park and take candid shots. They print the pictures taken and give it to you at the same spot. Though, we dint try anyone.

On the way to the upper view point, we had to cross a tea estate. Once you reach the view point, though you could see the falls at a little far distance, the view itself is beautiful.We found the safety measures were a little less and those who with kids needs to be extra careful. Carry your own water bottles/Snacks as there are no shops around to sell the same.

We were expecting little crowd.To our surprise, the place was calm and there was a little crowd allowing us to spend more time and take a lot of pictures.The place gives a wonderful view of the hills and plains. You can just sit and relax for sometime on the small rock that faces Rangaswamy Peak. Everytime the peak gets submerged in the cloud/mist and then it re-appears. Worth watching this phenomenon for any number of times.Do carry water/snacks along with you, as when we went, the shop that was supposed to sell water/tea/snacks was closed and we had a tough time.

We went to this temple on a weekend(Sunday) so it was extremely crowded. We had to wait for more than one hour before the darshan.But the biggest advantage we had was, after we were allowed, the temple closed its entry for noon pooja, so we got around one hour to do pradakshina around the inner premises. Also, we were able to get darshan of the god during their aarthi :) :) apart from our regular darshan. As the temple for less crowded, we even had a oppurtunity to get the prasadham directly from the priest when they were about to empty the vessels.We thought of having our lunch from Annadana seva facility in the temple, but by the time we came out of the temple, the queue was very long. So, we opted out of it.We also missed the early morning pooja which I had read is a blessing to see.Poeple planning can stay in Guruvayur over a night so that they can have darshan during early morning pooja also.

aidarulz|6BC21269A1DD59D7D788D94A4807E52B|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|4| “Good family theme park”|review_481274202|It's a fairly big theme park with rides suitable for all ages. I've been there twice and I've got to say my favourite is the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. For families with young children, I would recommend starting with Hollywood & New York (where the Sesame Street rides are) and work your way counter clockwise (Madagascar, Far Far Away, Lost World, etc.). The rides in those zones range from the most child-friendly to the more daring ones for older kids/adults. The queue can get very long very quickly and the average wait is often between 30-45 minutes even on a non-school holiday period. Best is to get to USS as early as you can and go straight for the rides you really want to go on first. My choices would be:a) Revenge of the Mummyb) Jurassic Park Rapids Adventurec) Canopy Flyerd) Enchanted Airwayse) Puss In Boots's Giant Journeye) Transformers The Ride : The Ultimate 3D BattleIf you hate waiting in line for too long, you can either purchase the express passes for a steep fee or queue up in the single rider lane (if you/your group don't mind riding separately).

A family-friendly restaurant with good food. Would highly recommend their salted egg soft shell crab and butter prawn. Location is convenient but parking can be a little difficult to find sometimes. The restaurant takes reservations if you plan to go in a group. Menu prices for individual items are slightly above average; although if dining with a big group and sharing the orders, the price per pax is reasonable and worth the amount and variety of food you could get. Do get a total price estimate from the staff for items with prices listed per kg (e.g. fish/seafood) before ordering. Many diners would simply order without checking and get a shock when the bill comes. Total rookie mistake! The restaurant is clean and comfortable. Service is generally okay, although occasionally it is difficult to get their attention especially when seated in the adjoining section. The staff are usually friendly and accommodating otherwise.

I found Putu Sudiana on Tripadvisor and contacted him to arrange a driver for our trip. He was quick to respond to all my emails prior to travelling and quoted us a very reasonable rate. When we got to Bali, we were assigned to Bim whom we took a liking to immediately. He was a very pleasant young man, polite, friendly and accommodating. We had a list of suggested places to visit from the internet and wanted to see as much of it as possible. Bim clearly knew Bali well when it comes to the local spots, culture, customs and ceremonies. We were in Bali about 2 weeks after the Kalungan festival and during the Purnama (full moon) which was a special day for ceremonies and festivities. Bim took the time to explain to us all about the Balinese culture when we asked and patiently making sure we understood. He was also flexible in carrying forth our itinerary, which often times changed according to our whims/mood/time of day/energy/etc. He gave useful suggestions in helping us plan out our day, making sure we were able to visit and see all that we wanted (and more!) by the end of our tour. He was not pushy either and knew how to please the elders (my aunts & uncle), which was a huge plus! Bim also suggested some good places to eat and shop according to our planned budget and took us through local villages as opposed to the usual tourist spots so we could see how the Balinese people actually live. We felt safe with him driving us around and he made sure the car was clean and comfortable for us throughout his service. We thoroughly enjoyed Bali and Bim's company during our four days with him. We will definitely use and recommend Putu's company and Bim to our friends, family and anyone who seeks a local driver in Bali.

Be sure to take a MRT map from any station or your hotel reception. Its a very convenient and cheap mode of option even if you are alone or with family. I had read reviews where people said if you are a family of 4 then probably a CAB would cost you similar or a little more, but I disagree to it. CAB is way expensive compared to MRT. CAB may also have hidden charges lit phone booking, night charges after 6 PM, etc. At the passenger service desk you get a EZ link card for which MRT charges SGD $5 which is not refundable. However you can keep topping up this card as and when needed. The connectivity and the frequency is just wonderful and it can take you to all the attractions in SGP. Best part is MRT refunds you the money which is unused on your EZLink card whenever you approach the counter. Kids 6 and under travel free. You will surely save a lot of money by using MRT for your local travel. To and fro from your hotel to Changi airport is also available but I took a CAB as I had a lot of luggage. There are fines for eating and drinking on the train so make sure you follow the rules. The MRT service is excellent and trains are very clean. Don't miss it.

I bought so much of junk shopping here that I had to buy a suitcase to carry it :) Other similar shopping areas are Mustafa and Chinatown. These places also offer excellent street food options. Loved the chicken rice and noodles. If you want to buy souvenirs then don't miss this place. Very good connectivity by MRT and local buses.

You can buy the tickets at the counter or even at the Sentosa station. They sell tickets for all the attractions in Sentosa

Amanda J|6F76ADBAD4DFF4EE1C42441DEDE5410B|Hotel|Singapore: Oasia Hotel Novena, Singapore by Far East Hospitality|5| “Love this hotel!”|review_511279636|I found this hotel on line at the last minute through Trip Advisor and I could not have been happier! The service provided by the staff was excellent and they made you feel very welcome and nothing was an issue for them. My first contact was Xavier at the front desk and he was fantastic. He told me about their upgrade package and it was well worth doing. It gave us access to the Club Lounge, free cocktail hour, free snacks and drinks throughout the day, private pool, free airport lounge voucher, free hop on hop off bus tour. I spoke to him a couple of times during our stay and he was always friendly, professional and very helpful. The staff in the Club Lounge also deserve a special mention because they went out of their way to make us feel welcomed and very well looked after. Especially Letitia, Anne, Hazrul and Shakila. We were greeted each day by name, they got to know our coffee orders and were consistently checking to make sure we had everything we needed. This is a hotel I will stay at on all my trips to Singapore because of the service. The rooms were clean, tidy and very comfortable beds. The doormen area very helpful as well and there is a Grab taxi kiosk if you need to use it. However, each room has a smart device which is free for guests to use and you can take it with you when you leave the hotel. There is a MRT station underneath the hotel so it is very safe for travellers especially if you are travelling solo. Very, very happy with this hotel and highly recommend it.

We ate here on a Thursday evening and it wasn't very busy but still had an amazing atmosphere. Fantastic service from our waitress and cool old school background music. We were made to feel very welcome and relaxed. The food was beautiful and decent sizes. We all had the chicken burger and it was succulent, fresh and very filling.
Amanda J|6F76ADBAD4DFF4EE1C42441DEDE5410B|Hotel|Singapore: Aqueen Hotel Lavender|4| “Fantastic staff and good location”|review_487840827|This is a neat travelers hotel. If you just want somewhere to sleep in between tripping around Singapore then this is the place. If you are looking for a hotel with a pool, 24/7 room service and all the extras this is not the hotel for you. I stayed in a King Deluxe room and it had everything I needed . I think the Queen rooms are quite small though looking at other travelers photos. The size of the room was perfect for one traveler or a couple. The front desk staff could not have been any more helpful, friendly and accommodating. There is a bus stop 1 minute down the road if you would like to use the Hippo Hop on and off bus. It's a short walk to a 7 Eleven shop and Makan Stalls. Overall, great value for money.
Amanda J|6F76ADBAD4DFF4EE1C42441DEDE5410B|Attractions|Paekakariki: Paekakariki Escarpment Walkway|5| “Step out of your comfort zone”|review_484787546|I am scared of heights and in no way fit so was abut nervous about this walk. We parked a Pukerua Railway Station and headed off to Paekakareki. It was simply amazing and the view at the summit was well worth the hundreds of stairs! There are parts of the track initially that are scary due to being on the side of a hill and a small track but as long as you take it slow on those parts it was fine. The swing bridges were awesome after getting down some pretty steep stairs to get to them. There are no hand rails so again if you are nervous just take it slow. We went on a week day and passed about 6 other groups. I'm not sure about the weekend but I would guess it would be very busy. Finishing at Paekakareki was fantastic. There is a cafe and a bar that serves coffee, clean toilets and the train station. Depending on the time of day, trains run between 20-30mins. It's $3.50 back to Pukerua Train Station. Make sure you take warm clothing because even though you get hot, the weather can change quickly and the wind can get chilly. Thanks to the people who built and maintain the track, it's had a lot of work done to it. Overall, a fantastic way to step out of your comfort zone!
Amanda J|6F76ADBAD4DFF4EE1C42441DEDE5410B|Attractions|Singapore: Plaza Premium Lounge|5| “Great lounge!”|review_481533390|I booked a 3 hour stay in the Plaza Premium Lounge for a late flight. It was great to be able to have a shower, nice meal, charge my devices and relax. Changi is a fantastic Airport to wander around but after a 5 day full on trip this was excellent. The lounge is nice and quiet.The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The food was simple but nice and plenty of it. Free coffee, tea, soft drinks, water, beer and wine. You only have to pay for the top shelf spirits.The shower was immaculate and very spacious. Just like a nice hotel room bathroom. There was complimentary shampoo, body wash, toothbrush, toothpaste, comb and cotton buds. Just remember that you have already checked your luggage before heading through immigration so pack small toiletries for the shower.I read a review recently about only 5 footstools and it is still the same LOL. I grabbed on nice and early before it got busy. Heaps of seating though with power points next to every seat. Free wifi is available through the lounge.Overall I was very happy with paying for the 3 hours and will use this service again.

If you are looking for fantastic, authentic dishes, this is the place to go. It cost $7.50 for a dry wonton noodle soup and $1.00 a satay stick. (There is a minimum purchase of 10 satay at a time.). A must visit if you are on Sentosa Island. Be aware though that it is closed on Wednesdays.
Amanda J|6F76ADBAD4DFF4EE1C42441DEDE5410B|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|4| “Leave your expectations at the door ...”|review_481118699|This theme park is awesome as long as you do not compare it to the original. It has all the feel of a Universal Studios. Food and drinks are expensive but if you plan for that it won't be a shock. About $6.50 for a bottle of water. I read the Trip Case reviews before going so arrived early on a Wednesday at 09:30am and there were already about 1,000 people lined up! I was going to tough it out but the heat was too much so I purchased an express pass for $50SGD. It allowed me priority entry well ahead of the big crowd and a maximum wait time of only about 5 mins! I only rode 4 rides because of my timeframe. Transformers, Cyclone, Battlestar Galactica and The Mummy but it was worth it! It is hot and sticky in the line and some do not have air conditioners only fans going. The express allowed me to bypass the crowds. The staff here are fantastic with queue jumpers. They simply redirected them to the back of the line politely and won't engage in any further conversation with them and usher you forward. Don't forget to pack a hanky or flannel for the sweat. I will definitely be back again for a full day.
Amanda J|6F76ADBAD4DFF4EE1C42441DEDE5410B|Attractions|Mulifanua: Pure Ocean|4| “Great place to hire scooters”|review_456020916|This is a great place to hire scooters and saves you having to go into town or online. The staff are very helpful and will give you instructions on which roads are the best to use. However, we were told it would take 2 hours to ride around the whole island but it was closer to 5 - 6 hours. Good little scooters, very economical. Stop at the last petrol station before the resort to fill up, the staff there will do it for you. It cost us $8 tala to fill both scooters after riding for about 3.5 hours. Make sure you wear heaps of suntan lotion and reapply it! The cost to hire was very cheap $90 for 24 hours which included your driving permit. Make sure to take your drivers license and passport down when you book.
Amanda J|6F76ADBAD4DFF4EE1C42441DEDE5410B|Hotel|Mulifanua: Sheraton Samoa Beach Resort|5| “Fantastic resort facilities and staff”|review_456019925|This is a lovely resort with a real authentic Samoan feel. The staff are fantastic! They are professional, respectful and provide excellent service. Although this is about 45 minutes out of the main town of Apia, it is well worth staying here. We visited a number of other resorts on the island and none came close to Aggies. If you want to hire a scooter and drive around the island, go to Pure Ocean which is at the far end of the resort because they are an agent for Moto Scooters and can sort everything for you. No need to travel into town. I would highly recommend riding scooters on a Sunday only! The other days are very busy. Allow a good 5 - 6 hours to ride around the whole island with stops on the way round. The Manaia Polynesian Spa is a must visit. They normally have specials so ask at reception before you book. The outdoor setting and staff there are simply magic. The food is lovely and very large meals so worth having breakfast included in your booking so you can fill up before heading out sightseeing or just lazing by the pool. This is a must stay location! Just remember that you are in the islands so the internet is really, really slow here and there is no need to rush.

The staff were lovely but the place needs a makeover. The bed was super comfy but the comforter was stained on the top and underneath. Yuck! Shower had good water pressure but old and cracking in the corner, pink body fat on the shelve and it was falling apart. The shower head was very flimsy and lose. A shame you can't use the balcony and there is construction going on at the back which was very noisy, even at night. There were some ants in the kitchen sink but otherwise the kitchen was very clean. Overall, I am happy to stay here for work because its only to sleep but would not book for a personal trip.

Room service was late in the morning but the food was excellent. The only downfall was the noise.

Outstanding service, atmosphere and food! The staff are lovely, very helpful and professional. The food is (in the words of one of the staff) "Island size serves" so real value for money. The place is clean and tidy, has a lovely feel to it. Just be aware that they do not take credit cards. Definitely a place I'll be visiting again!

Simon was our guide and he made the trip fun and exciting. Having someone who is down to earth, safety conscious and experienced allowed us to relax and enjoy the amazing scenery that Martinborough has to offer. The rifle shoot was a bit of a laugh and something different. We were also provided with afternoon tea, coffee and cake on top of a large hill where we could see Lake Ferry and back to Martinborough. Just stunning. The equipment was well maintained and comfy. We did the 2.5 hour trip and will definitely be back to do the longer one!

It cost $41.00 (don't take Credit Cards) for Big Daddy Eggs, Eggs Benedict and two medium lattes. The Big Daddy Eggs came out on toast sitting on half a cooked banana and underneath was a slice if mellon. Very strange combination. Eggs were ok but about the same quality as I cook at home. My partners Eggs Benedict was average and his eggs were overcooked to the same consistency as hard boiled eggs. Coffee was watery. Such a shame given how lovely the staff were.

We were made to feel like second class citizens. She made coffees for people who arrived after us because she knew them and after we asked to order, she stood at our table with her hand on her hip with an attitude that we were taking up her time. Very disappointing because Romeo's is a lovely restaurant and normally has wonderful staff working.

Great spot within walking distance to town and heaps of information about what to do in the area. It is so hard these days to get vaule for money and service with a genuine smile but the Te Aroha Motel has both. I would highly recommend staying here. I will be back :0)

The black pepper crab was huge and firm. The sea cucumbers were thick and chewy. Together with fish maw, baby abalone, mushrooms and prawns. Very fresh. Fried Rice, Tofu and La-La are full of savouring.However, the reserving of dishes are slow. Properly they thought no Muslims are fasting at my table. (My husbands and me are fasting. I am a Chinese Muslims convert).But thing which I barely can endure is the air-con. I was perspiring while I was eating.

Water playground is fun but some slides are closed. Don't know why? No enough of floats and life jackets. Until almost closing time then able to find.But the worst one is the locker's system. Some machines can pay by nets, but some machine cannot. Some machines can only pay for small lockers, not big lockers. I need a big locker to put our belonging for 4 paxs. No changes given. Even is NTUC member also pay under the rate of a non-member. If want to go back to the previous page, still need about 30 seconds to log out. I took my cash, nets and NTUC card about 10 times from my purse just to find a locker using the machine. I don't have the exact amount, so I want to use nets. But the nets is not working and need to wait to log out from the system again. Then use cash, paying non- member rate because no changes can be given. I almost spent 1/2 hour doing this locker system to put my belonging. Luckily I came with my husband and he brought my children to play first. If I am alone, sorting out how to use the machine for 1/2 hour, my children won't not have the patience to wait and will make me more frustrated figuring out the locker's system. Also the price is not cheap. Cost me $10 for 4 hours. Such expensive price for such a poor system.We played until the closing time. The ladies washroom is full and queue is long. My girlfriend and I went back without shower. Only bath our children in the kids shower only.The next time when I came here again will be staying in the chalet. So no locker and shower problem.

However, the express pass is so so so expensive. I bought one in the end but also didn't go and try all the rides. The timing for shows should have more frequency. As the tickets are really very expensive, if compare with the zoo and bird parks. The foods in the restaurants is even more expensive, compare with the hotel which I stayed in Sentosa and they didn't taste so great either. Also, always hard to find a table in the restaurants.

I am looking for something special. And beauty is something that you must have within you first, before you can find it. This resort is a hidden gem.The nature environment is something you can't find in other hotels in Sentosa. You can hear the crickets' chirping. You can see squirrels climbing the trees. You can see peacocks walking proudly. You can see gardeners doing gardening and staffs here are making efforts to save the earth and environment. The waiters here are those who are in special needs. They hope to earn a living on themselves too. The breakfast here are home made food. Simple but feel warming and delicious. If have some bee hoon or noodles add in to menu will be better.The rooms are simple but if touch up on those wore off areas, will be perfect.

Looking his young photos with his mother (already passed on) is kind of sad. Hope the zoo can arrange another female polar bear from other countries to accompany him and have his offspring. I enjoyed the tram ride watching the animals around while my children were feeling tired, but the service stops at 5.30pm. We were only able to catch the Splash Safari show on 5pm as we entered the zoo late. The sea lion (didn't able catch his name earlier) is very smart and adorable. Splashing the water, making the audiences screamed. He is very happy with his trainer.Orang Utans looks so comfortable with their peers and bonding with one another. They are the most blissful animals in the zoo. Hope to have more than one animals among the same species.Will be back again with another earlier timing to watch all the animals show.

Staffs were friendly and helpful. There were animals for my children to see. Walking on the shaking bridge which connected to the other side of activity center was fun.

They were very tasty.A mini mart was nearby but it closed too early when we wanted to buy some stuffs for our night BBQ.We catered for night BBQ because we wanted our children to experience campfire outside our tents. The food items were delicious. However, despite we had instructed the restaurant all food must be non-spicy, the fried rice and fried noodles served late and were spicy for our children. We then specially ordered some more non-spicy food for our children. The restaurant manager had done recovery after our feedback, not much disappointment on this.Blackout during our spa massage. No air-con and interruption in music. We didn't really enjoy our spa, but after our feedback, there was recovery which didn't make us upset.Although we had experienced some hiccups, the recoveries were done quick enough.

Wheelchair has provided for my MIL who has difficulties in walking. The restaurant for breakfast is opposite of the road, beside the theme park. Although is a very simple restaurant and lack of varieties, the food tasted nice and staffs are fast to clear the plates before we place another plate with food. The only restaurant "Pappa Rich" is avaliable if we didn't get into the theme park. Free entrance to go to hot spring, properly because there is no swimming pool in the hotel. 10% off to purchase tickets for the theme park. I believe this hotel wants to keep it simple is to make it affordable for visitors to stay to go to the theme park.

These museum if perfect for those instances. Some images are very disturbing but it will help you realize and understand somehow the pain and suffering these people endure. You will also know on these museum the local's life before and after the Vietnam War. I am encouraging everybody to visit these place at least once to appreciate the life and freedom we have today.

The Angkor Complex is magnificent and I really enjoyed my time there. However beware of the scammers on the ticketing booth. Some random local will approach you and will offer you an ''expedite'' service wherein you will no longer have to fall in line. I am only speaking in behalf of my self and based on my experience. Once you gave the money they will run and the last thing you will know is you are on the ticket booth waiting for nothing. Reporting the incident will not also do you any good. The security will check the cctv footage but they will not offer any refund. In the end you have to fall inline and pay again.

No inflight entertainment, small legroom, dirty seats and no free meal. On the other hand it is quite cheap so the service is kinda acceptable. The flight departed from Hanoi very late.

First, cabin crews should be firm when explaining to the passengers. They cannot just say yes to whatever the passenger want. I was forced to changed my seat because apparently two of the passengers want to be seated together. What's the purpose of doing a web check in if in the end they will not honor it. Second they talk too fast and we can't hardly understand them. The accent must be the reason. In that case they should speak slowly. Aside from that everything's ok though the flight arrived two minutes late.

I hope they can bounce back since they are really one of the best airlines in providing excellent service. Aircraft is also big and has a wide range of inflight entertainment. There is also a usb plug that you can charge your devices. On board meal is acceptable.

However that does not necessarily mean that the service should be low. Flight is delayed and the cabin crews are like robots. You can clearly see that they are just doing those stuff because they required to and because they want. Also the PA system is very bad. You can't barely understand what he/she is saying.

It was my son's 2nd Birthday and my wife plan a trip to USS. It was an enjoyable place for the young and old and I was very suprised at how all the events, shows and rides are well planned out. It was a hectic day out bit it would be best if anyone visiting USS to reserve 2 days as 1 day will be very rushing to sit on all rides.

The resident manager gave us a warm welcome when we arrived at the jetty. 1. Infinity pool was wonderful,especially facing the sea.2. Rooms were carrfully crafted and it reminds me of the kampung days in singapore (originate). The locals are of malay origin and malay is their language. + point for me. Mosquito attacks was bad at night. Sleeping was impossible. Mosquito nets would be a great thing to have around the beds since repellent lose out to the strong mosquitos.3. Food review was bad earlier travellers. When we reach,was told that they change the head chef which is from maldives. Wonderful food and magical taste. Chef was great in getting feedback after meals.Bad point is that food is only available during breakfast lunch and dinner. Would be great to have small bites in between especially food lovers like me. 4. Trip to local vilage tour was great. It was an eye opener to see how locals lead their faily lives. Trekking was a great adventure especially with my preggy wife and at the end of it was a great suprise. A waterfall. Woohoo!!This is a great place for couples and family wanting to spend quality time together instead of having technology disturbance. No wifi(which is great).
