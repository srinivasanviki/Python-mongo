Since I am living in Singapore, I have been to USS several times. This review would be the latest Halloween Horror Night theme. It was a great experience and the crowd is just huge! You have to purchase the express pass and believe me it is worth every penny. You don't want to be queuing all night long. The horror houses are fun and exciting! You have to come with your friends or family. But please do not bring little kids along during the Halloween horror night because it is mainly themed for adults. But if you are going there on a regular day, I bet everyone of all ages will just love the experience!
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Restaurant|Singapore: Timbre+|4| “Good selection of food and drinks”|review_461864689|For me it's like a high-end hawker style food court. We went there for dinner and drinks last October 2016 and they had a show on Octoberfest so we thought it was cool and fun. The drinks were not the common drinks you buy from stores and it's not that cheap. There's a wide variety of food including Pinoy food which is not something you can find everywhere in Singapore. It's a good hang out place for working professionals.
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Restaurant|Manila: Music 21 Plaza|4| “A good place for your vocal chords”|review_461863795|It's a nice place to hang out with friends and sing karaoke! Although their pricing is a bit ridiculous because we were only 3 persons so they offered us a room for 4 persons. Since the price is fixed, we needed to pay for 4 persons even though we were only 3. Still giving it a very good review because I enjoyed the time with my friends.
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Restaurant|Singapore: RedDot Brewhouse|4| “Nice chillax place”|review_461862700|Overlooking the river at the outside seating or watching the band inside, it's a good place to just chill and relax whether you're alone or with friends. my friend tried the green monster and he said it was okay. I tried the very safe summer ale and I liked it.
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Restaurant|Singapore: Crystal Jade|5| “Mum loved the Dim sum”|review_461861520|Giving this restaurant an excellent rating as my mum who visited me here in Singapore last December 2016 loved the Dim sum and she kept on craving for it ever since she tasted it here. An improvement though can be that all the staff (waiters and waitresses) would know how to communicate in English.
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Hotel|Batam Center: Radisson Golf & Convention Center Batam|5| “An excellent hotel choice!”|review_461858201|This hotel is a great place to stay whether you are travelling for business or leisure. They have huge function rooms, bosting swimming pools (both indoor and outdoor), mouth-watering food (breakfast, lunch and dinner - even high tea) and of course exceptional rooms with excellent views! All staff were friendly and approachable. The general manager herself is a fantastic example of good service for her staff. Good job everyone!
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Restaurant|Batu Ampar: Harbour Bay Seafood Restaurant|5| “Very Affordable Seafood Restaurant in Batam”|review_461584688|Been here twice as their food was great and the price is very affordable! After our massage, we were looking for a seafood place to eat which is open. That was in the afternoon around 3:00pm. All other restaurants were closed and this is the only one open. We are so glad to eat here as their food were awesome and the price is not expensive unlike the other famous restaurants in Batam. Just one taxi away (around 20-30 minutes) from the Ferry terminal.
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Attractions|Hong Kong: Hong Kong Disneyland|5| “Happiest place on earth!”|review_461341524|Whatever age you are, you will always love Disneyland! Two special times you should go, Christmas or Halloween and our schedule permitted us to go during Halloween! Loved what they did to the place. The decoration, shows, highlights and all! Although the food can be pricey, you and your family will love to see Mickey mouse and the whole gang. Plan your visit here in order to skip attractions or rides that are not suitable for you. The park opens at 10am so better be there early in order to make your trip worthwhile.
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Attractions|Hong Kong: Ocean Park|5| “A huge park with lots of attractions”|review_461336237|When you go to this place, you have to go either Christmas or Halloween and we are blessed to be here during the Halloween! Fantastic theme and decorations. My teenagers loved the rides and the experience. You have to plan your activities as it is a huge park and you may skip some rides that are inappropriate for your age or preference. If you're going on a weekend or public holiday, please take the fast pass to skip the queue to maximize your time there. Watch the dolphin show as it is entertaining. The rides for the adventure and thrill-hearted are The Flash, Hair Raiser and The Abyss.
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Attractions|Hong Kong: Madame Tussauds Hong Kong|5| “Fun place to take photos”|review_461332094|Our family went here as it is one of the places to visit in Hong Kong. The wax figures are real-like and it was awesome to take photos with them. Our family had fun posing with the celebrities. At least we met their wax figures. Lol. It's at the Peak so please see my review on the Peak (Victoria Peak) Hong Kong.
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Attractions|Hong Kong: Victoria Peak (The Peak)|5| “Terrific view of Hong Kong”|review_461331229|We bought the tickets in Klook because it was the cheapest. We met the tour guides at Central MTR exit. Walked our way to the Peak Tram. Skipped the queue (thanks to Klook) and boarded the train. It was an awesome view while going to the top but quite scary. If you want to see the view. You have to sit on the right of the train. Go there in the morning (9am to 10am) so it's not too hot or in the afternoon (4pm to 6pm) so you can see the sunset. Go to Madame Tussauds and Sky100 to make your trip there worthwhile.
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Attractions|Ho Chi Minh City: Cu Chi Tunnels|4| “One of a kind experience”|review_461331205|You have to take a bus in order to get there. If you're interested in Saigon's history, this is one of the places that you should go to. But if you are claustrophobic, please do not enter the tunnel as it is very dark, very small, very hot and very stuffy inside. If you're up for the adventure, you must try this.
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Attractions|Ho Chi Minh City: Saigon Food Tour|5| “Once in a lifetime Scooter/Streetfood Tour”|review_461326021|It was a great way to eat and roam around Saigon using a scooter. The drivers were very young and small built but they can actually ride the scooter with you at the back no matter how big you are. They are very friendly and they speak good English, too! The food stops that we went to though are not as what we expected as we ate mostly veggies and we are meat lovers. Nonetheless, they are very accommodating because we wanted to go to Hard Rock cafe just to buy some souvenirs before heading home and they sent us there even if it is out of way. Loved the experience and gaining new friends!
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Attractions|Ho Chi Minh City: Foot Massage Salon Quynh Nhu 137|5| “Love the massage!”|review_461324014|Excellent massage! When you're in Saigon, you have to try their massage! They have Step 1 to Step 12 routine and it's totally amazing. The price is cheap also so one must try.
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Hotel|Ho Chi Minh City: Alagon Central Hotel & Spa|4| “Budget friendly hotel”|review_461322938|Walking distance to Bến Thành Market. Small rooms yet cozy. We had one small window facing the wall so the view was of course not great. Food was as per normal but little selection. Front desk was friendly and helpful. They have a jacuzzi pool on roof top which we thought was awesome. Their drinks are quite pricey for a small hotel though. Overall, it was an okay hotel.
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Restaurant|Ho Chi Minh City: Pho 2000|4| “Good food”|review_461305645|One of the must-tries in Bangkok (as they say). We tried it and thought that the food was okay. The service was very speedy as they also need you to eat fast because a lot of people are waiting. With that, you could imagine how packed and small the place is. My boyfriend thought the pho was okay. I tried their pork chop with rice and thought it was fine.
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Hotel|Bangkok: Park Plaza Bangkok Soi 18|5| “Amazing Hotel!”|review_461304368|I agree with all the positive reviews for this hotel. Very close to train station for convenience of travel. Amazing food with friendly service. Clean room as they clean and give you fresh amenities daily. Everything was just superb!
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Restaurant|Bangkok: Chao Phraya Princess Cruise|5| “A very relaxing dinner cruise”|review_461302528|We had a great time in this dinner cruise. It was a buffet dinner and the food was magnificent. There was Western and Asian food choices. The price was very worthy as the price was acceptable for tourist while having awesome choices of food. The band was fun as the host did some stand-up comedy. I would like to go for this trip again!
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Restaurant|Bangkok: Hard Rock Cafe Bangkok|5| “Good music, great food and awesome service!”|review_461299566|This is a place for alternative rock lovers. Ambiance was wonderful. Food was great. Service was friendly and fast. Price was not bad as well! You should visit this place when you're in Bangkok.
Alessa_Josue|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|Attractions|Bangkok: Asiatique The Riverfront|4| “So many things to do!”|review_461298037|Asiatique is where Calypso is. It's a good place to walk around, shop, see Calypso show and just have fun. Although I would not recommend buying all your souvenir items here because it is not as cheap as Chatuchak,
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Restaurant|Ballarat: Grill'd|4| “Good burgers, cold area!”|review_497770096|Now, the burgers were great, don't get me wrong. I had the black crumbed chicken and loved it, and the others liked their burgers too. But our table in the window got the freezing breeze every time someone came in or went out. They really need a panel there to stop diners copping that in Winter. Brrr! At the moment I wouldn't go with a large party as it's the only large table.But go for the burgers, definitely! So many choices, including buns.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Restaurant|Adelaide: Hong Kee Restaurant|5| “Best food, friendly service”|review_486681565|I'm not a big Chinese food fan, but went along with hubby and a Chinese friend. l found plenty of food to enjoy out of the variety our friend selected. I especially loved the salt and pepper squid, and the lemon chicken was quite delicate. Our Chinese friend hasn't been impressed with Chinese food in Australia, but she definitely thought the Hong Kee food was good. We'd happily go again.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Singapore: Cavenagh Bridge|5| “Nice bridge, nice cats!”|review_462086827|The bridge is worth the visit- it's very attractive and historic, it has lovely views up and down the river, right next to the Fullerton Hotel, which is a feature on its own, and it has the sweetest bronzes of a cat and 2 kittens on the opposite side to the bronzes of the children leaping into the water- same side as the oxen cart. The other bronzes are lovely, but I was personally pleased with the cats. It's just near Merlion Park, so isn't hard to get to.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Fort Siloso Skywalk|5| “Good!!”|review_461844872|I always like walkways high in the air, and this one was as good as any. The actual Fort Siloso is at the end of it, but of course you don't have to see it if you don't want to. Interesting to see that the posh resort out that end gets to see the shipping area with cranes and stuff- 5 star view, I don't think!
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Fort Siloso|5| “Good piece of history”|review_461844600|If you don't like history much, this may not interest you, but we spent about 90 minutes here. Lots of information, and the fact you are walking through the fort with very few spots blocked off makes it feel more real. There's a little bit of hill work, so be ready for that, but you can rest in between if you need. We're glad we went.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Sentosa Merlion|4| “One of eight.”|review_461844144|We saw this Merlion on our second day. He's huge and a big awesome, and we didn't even bother going up. Next day we found out the Marina Bay merlion was covered up for renovation, so at least we got to see others, including this one.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|4| “Good fun day.”|review_461843832|Fairly typical Universal (though I've only been to LA as well, I must admit) but of course it's fun. We went on a Tuesday and though a lot of the rides got longer and longer lines as the day went on, we got on most of them within 10 minutes- the only one was Battlestar Galactica, which took 30 minutes, even early in the day. We liked Waterworld (it's good no matter where you go!) and the Lights, Camera, Action, and Far Far Away Land (Shrek) was fun. If you like theme parks, you'll still like this, though I can't imagine doing it for more than a day.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Singapore: Orchard Road|4| “ION Sky is the attraction here.”|review_461832784|The shops are too extravagant for me, and I'm not a big window shopper, but the Sky is worth the travel to here.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Singapore: ION Sky|5| “Stunning views.”|review_461832507|Now, this one is free, which has EVERYthing going for it, but as it's out of the was a little, not everyone will get here. But it's very well worth the effort. We liked this more than the Skydeck, not just because it was free, but the viewing was much better, and you were viewing different areas. Even if this is all you go to Orchard for, it should be worth it.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Cable Car|5| “Fun!”|review_461832005|If you don't like cable cars, don't think this one will change your mind. It was swinging in the wind a little for us, which made me nervous, but of course it will. But if you DO like them, you'll love this, for the comfort and the views. We got a Cable Car/Universal ticket which included unlimited cable car rides, so we went to Fort Siloso as well. Good day all around.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Singapore: The Helix Bridge|4| “Interesting bridge,”|review_461831470|It is just a bridge, but the details of it make it very interesting to walk across, and you get another view of the harbour.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Singapore: Merlion Park|4| “He was closed. :(”|review_461831239|The merlion was under repair when we were there, but the area is lovely to walk around anyway. There is the merlion cub right beside him, and other merlions around the city, so it didn't ruin the holiday. A bit nearby, on Cavanagh Bridge near the Fullerton Hotel, we found the 3 bronze cats I'd been wanting to see, so I was still happy.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Singapore: Chinatown|4| “Good fun shopping and food.”|review_461830563|One of the places to go shopping in Singapore. The souvenirs are mostly the same as other places, but how do you find that special thing if you don't look? Perhaps it's here. It has the only Michelin- star street food stall, which we didn't try as we'd just had our lunch! Will try it next time we go. The temple is worth a look, too.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Singapore: Supertree Grove|5| “Amazing, even without the light show.”|review_461829778|We got our times mixed up and missed the light show. We arrived just on dark, at 9.30, and it didn't matter really, as the trees were lit and looked beautiful in the night time. It was a pleasant night, with a cool breeze. so we weren't very disappointed, and it wasn't crowded! I'm sure the light show is impressive, but we still loved it just lit up.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Singapore: Marina Bay Sands Skypark|4| “Very impressive.”|review_461827384|What an awesome experience. The wind whips through your hair as you look all around the city. It's a great view, and the only disappointment to me is it's a bit pricey to just stand on the roof, but the only other alternative-ION Sky- is a bit out of the city, so not everyone will get there. Still, this is very good. We did it instead of the Flyer, just by our own choice, and probably got the same views.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Singapore: Cloud Forest|5| “Favourite attraction for me.”|review_461826270|There plenty of good things to see in Singapore, but this was the highlight for me. (Except for the otters we saw on the path just past the domes!) We spent 2 hours wandering back down- it's an elevator to the top, thank heaven! You don't have to be a gardening nut to enjoy the beauty of the flowers- it's so beautifully done. Now I understand the reports saying "don't miss it"!
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT)|5| “Nothing to complain about”|review_461824725|I truly can't think of anything that wasn't great about this service. The ticket machine is easy to read, you can keep topping up your ticket 5 times and then get 10c off (which is also re-using tickets instead of printing more out), the train seems to go everywhere and often (we didn't need to use a bus), it's all clean and spotless...no problems at all. We took our luggage on to Changi airport and had no hassles at all- bearing in mind it was 8pm on a Saturday, not peak times! Excellent service.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Nanjing: Xiaoling Tomb of Ming Dynasty|5| “Stunning sight”|review_425778950|This is simply a beautiful area to visit. The walk up the mountain is lovely, and not too bad. The steps seem never-ending, but the view from the top toward Nanjing is worth it. So many things to see- I can't remember how many there were. Walking back down from the top is so pleasant on a warm day- lots of trees make it shady, and the paths are smooth and easy. Then you go on to the Sacred Avenue with the pairs of animals.......we didn't get to see all of it, and would love to see more. Definitely worth the visit.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Shanghai: Yuyuan Old Street|4| “Pretty place to visit”|review_424879603|It's very pretty here with its old-style buildings, and it's combined with shopping too, which is a bonus. It will be crowded during public holidays- that should be pretty obvious, but it was fine when we were there before the Mid Autumn Festival.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Shanghai: Shanghai Subway|5| “Easiest place I've ever used”|review_424879344|It's almost too easy to get around by subway here. It's all laid out on the machines, and in the trains, in English as well as Chinese. This is how I will rely on moving around next time I'm in Shanghai.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Shanghai: APAC Yinyang Market|5| “Fun!!”|review_424879176|This is easy to get to by subway, and so much fun to shop at. There's a huge variety of goods, and it isn't necessarily shoddy stuff. I really hope the vendors enjoy the bargaining, as it's a load of fun for us to do it. We got new luggage- 2 large and a carry-on case for the same price we'd get one out here, and plenty of souvenirs I'm happy to keep or hand on to friends and family. I've got the address written down, because if I come back to Shanghai again, I'll be here again, too!
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Beijing: Ming Tombs (Ming Shishan Ling)|4| “Better than I expected”|review_423698258|Before we left, I'd looked online at this and felt it was going to be a bit dull. It wasn't. There is the same attractiveness about it as at other places. We were told that the actual tomb is just the mound at the back, and it's man-made (still very old, though!) and that was impressive enough, but the rest of the area is interesting too. I was told that the Avenue of Statues wasn't here, but photos here show that they are, so that's a little disappointing for me (but I got to see similar in Nanjing, so that's fine.) but the buildings and grounds here are beautiful for a stroll on a nice day. If you 'have' to go here because of a tour (like us), just enjoy it, it's not a disappointment.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Shanghai: Shanghai Disneyland|5| “Love it!”|review_423668859|Only had one day in mid September, and would love to get back sometime. The crowds were not large, and I rode Tron 5 times, which is what I'd mostly wanted to try. 'Pirates' was closed for the day, but we saw the Jack Sparrow Stunt Spectacular, and it doesn't matter at all that it's in Chinese, it's great fun and very clever! Peter Pan is the same as the DL one, but easier to get on to, especially as it has a FP. The Chinese don't seem to be keen on the Star Wars franchise, so I got my photo taken with R2D2, Darth Vader (who spoke wheezy Chinese- very funny!) and in the Millennium Falcon. The Castle Walk-through is beautiful- a bit hands-on story of Snow White, and not just for the princess lovers. The park was spotless, and there was very little line crashing, which I'd been warned about. I think it's a good park for Disney fans, with a mixture of same and new to keep most people happy.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Shanghai: Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station|5| “Awesome sight!”|review_423666502|What an amazing sight Hongqiao Station is! It's like being at an airport- not surprising, as it connects to Pudong airport, too. Despite its vastness, it's easy to get around and find your way, just a bit time consuming! Make this your hub for your visit to Shanghai as it's easy to get almost anywhere from here.Ticket machines are very easy to use for English speakers, and the trains announce stations in both Chinese and English, so little chance of making a mistake.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Shanghai: Huangpu River|4| “Nice to see”|review_423665928|Whether you stroll along during the day, or take the night cruise, this is a pleasant area to visit. We saw a few wedding photos being taken during the afternoon- interesting when you've had a Western marriage where all photos were taken on the day of the wedding.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Shanghai: Maglev Transportation|5| “Whoosh!”|review_423665450|What do I need to say?? The train is quick enough (especially if you're from Oz!) and getting around is so easy.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Shanghai: Shanghai Museum (Shanghai Bowuguan)|5| “Loved this!”|review_423665072|If you like museums, you'll love this, and if you don't really like them, there will still be at least one section you'll find interesting. 6 floors (I think) of different things, and we would have liked longer in there than our tour group's 1 hour.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Shanghai: The Bund (Wai Tan)|5| “Night cruise worthwhile”|review_423664752|We did a night cruise, and it's as stunning as you'd expect. Sure, it's just the buildings lit up, but they change as you cruise along, and the other boats are lit up too. Sounds really cliche, but on a nice night, it's a brilliant experience.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Hotel|Shanghai: Wyndham Bund East Shanghai|4| “Decent place to stay”|review_423664443|We stayed here with a Nexus Tour, and were on the 17th floor. The Wyndham seems to be trying to update itself, and looked impressive when first in the room, but just a few little things show its flaws. We had 2 drawers that wouldn't stay closed once I'd looked inside (don't we all have a look around??) and I jammed loo paper in to keep them shut, and we had to get someone to show us where to turn off the light in the wardrobe, which still shone through into the room. But there were plenty of good things.The bed was huge, soft but not saggy, and I loved the pillows- you could sculpt them to whatever thickness you wanted. The bathroom was impressive, with toilet and shower in separate cubicles. We managed to book an extra night when we realised we had nowhere to stay at the end of the tour- we used CTrip, and it was recognized, and we got to keep the same room without hassle. The concierge booked a taxi for us 2 mornings, which arrived when we wanted.We wouldn't mind staying here again, and I thought it was a decent hotel for a tour group booking.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Beijing: Juyong Pass of Great Wall|4| “Second time around,”|review_423369994|This is our second time at Juyong Pass. We were surprised to realise that there are 2 parts of the Wall here, pretty much parallel to each other, and we were at the 'lower' section. There was a little museum behind the gift shop where no-one was about, which was used by Buddhist monks, which was really pretty to see. There are beautiful little bronzes of the Chinese Zodiac in the courtyard. There is a Chairman Mao bronze down near the toilet block which is eyecatching. So you don't have to climb right up the wall to spend a good time here.

This time, we didn't go to the island over the 17-arch bridge, but went along the other side where the Long Corridor is. This was beautiful- we walked the full length, and the views, with blue skies and sunshine, were stunning. We ended at the Marble Boat, and it almost has to be seen to be believed. We still haven't been on the ferry across the lake or to the house on the hill, so will have to do that next time. We were on a bus tour both times, but it's never long enough at a place like this. Don't miss this- you should be pleased you saw it.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Beijing: Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest|5| “Beautiful”|review_423329337|Not much to say except that this is a stunning view on a good day. Blue sky behind the Hall, white fencing in front.........beautiful.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Beijing: Long Corridor at the Summer Palace|5| “Lovely strolling area”|review_423329060|While it's probably a bit hard to 'stroll' on a busy day, this was lovely for us on a pleasant day, with not many people about. The marble boat is near the end, and that's well worth the walk. Little cafe at the end if you feel the need to reward yourself- try a pea-flavoured icecream if you dare!
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Hotel|Beijing: Loong Palace Hotel & Resort|4| “Good hotel, stopped with tour”|review_423328605|We stayed here with the Nexus Tour. There was nothing wrong with it at all, and the breakfast was really good. It isn't close to the centre of Beijing at all, so individual travellers need to take note, but that's all I would be negative about.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Anaheim: Radiator Springs Racers|4| “Fun, no matter what your age”|review_342233742|This is a lot of fun, speeding along the track with the wind in your hair. (Hold onto your hat!) It's very, very popular, and the Fast Passes are all gone very quickly early in the day, so if you don't have youngsters with you, seriously consider Single Rider and split up. The ride sensation is the same, but you can be on the ride in just 5 minutes sometimes, and you might be racing against others in your party, anyway. Well worth a ride.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Anaheim: Peter Pan's Flight|5| “Beautiful experience”|review_342228060|I missed this last time I was here, and now so glad I got to ride it. The sensation of flying over London is lovely, and feels realistic. This ride has no FP or Single Rider, and is very popular, so you may be standing around for a while to get on, but have patience, it's worth it. Amazing to think that it is one of the original rides from 1966!
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Anaheim: California Screamin'|5| “More, more, more!!”|review_342227605|Absolutely my favourite ride from both parks. Too chicken to try it 9 years ago, I regretted it once I got home, and this time, I could hardly wait to try it. Once tried, I was hooked!! I did it 8 times in 4 days. You are very safely held in, so don't worry there. Loved the view over the park as the coaster climbs higher and higher. Just don't ask me what the loop is like- I closed my eyes, as I don't think my head could take it in!

Pay by exact cash, or get the day or weekly pass from the machine near the DL search area. We found the drivers very helpful and cheery, and the timetable is really easy to follow.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Anaheim: The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|5| “Soooooooooo good!”|review_342226753|Wow, I hadn't seen where to review the rides in the parks, but I'm delighted to be able to review. I'm mid 50's, and absolutely loved this. On my second visit to the parks (last time 9 years ago) I was much braver about thrill rides, and found out how much fun this was! It's not for everyone, but give it a try if you think you may like it. It's perfectly safe, the lead-up to it is fun, and the view out the top (for the split second it happens!) is awesome. Second only to Cali Screamin' in my opinion.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Ballarat: Lake Wendouree|5| “Perfect afternoon walk”|review_334665692|When the weather is nice, there is hardly a better place for an hour's walk than Lake Wendouree. The paths are good, there are public toilets in a few places, lots of seating and playgrounds, and of course, you don't have to walk all the way around if you don't want to. Even if the weather isn't summery, it can still be a good walk, as the lake looks different at different times of the year.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Ballarat: Ballarat Botanical Gardens|5| “Beautiful, and free”|review_334665038|At the beginning of summer, the gardens were absolutely stunning to visit. Everything was green or blooming, and the paths are so pleasant to stroll about. There is the Prime Minister Avenue, the Robert Clark Glasshouse (it doesn't have to be begonia season to be worth the visit) and the marble statues to see, plus the fern house and goldfish ponds. It's a lovely place to take visitors of all ages, and well worth the stop.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Ballarat: Sovereign Hill|4| “Good for anyone to visit”|review_334521790|Our Chinese friends went with a local interpreter. He was expecting them to be there for 2 hours at most, but they stayed for 3 and a half, as they were so interested in everything. I was so pleased they found so much to see, as I've taken others there before, and we have spent as long (or more) as well. Always worth visiting, even after 40 years.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Princetown: Twelve Apostles|5| “Never a disappointing view”|review_334521488|This time I visited in brilliant sunshine. The colours of the water were stunning. It's easy to take photos even if a bit crowded, as the boardwalk is long and you can find a spot for your photo. It really is one of the most beautiful natural sights you can see for free.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Princetown: Great Ocean Road Wildlife Park|5| “Wildlife, AND the best pizza you could have!”|review_334521246|So much fun to feed the kangaroos and emus, but if it's afternoon, a few of them are already full, so don't always want to eat. Our Chinese visitors loved being up close to them all. And the woodfired pizzas are to die for- get into the margharita, it's a stunner!!
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Port Campbell: Apostle Whey Cheese|4| “Worth the visit”|review_334520942|Friendly people, nice view from the cheese room, a chance to watch cows being milked at the right time of day, and plenty of cheese to sample and buy. Definitely worth the visit- our Chinese visitors bought $90 of cheese which travelled safely back with them. Great tourist spot.
centralvic|BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518|Attractions|Port Campbell: Loch Ard Gorge|5| “Beautiful and natural”|review_334520764|It's a little inlet with high cliffs and a sandy beach. Sounds boring in print, but it's a beautiful sight from in the gorge, and make sure you read the history on the way down. I've been here in both good weather and winter weather, and it is good both ways. Being there is much more impressive than photos can show.

We headed straight to the Lower Lot and onto Transformers. Loved it, and we rode it 3 times in a row, as there were no others lining up for it. We were encouraged to make it a fourth, but couldn't handle it! Onto Jurassic Park, and rode this 3 times, too, only stopping because we were soaked! I rode the Mummy by myself just once, as it didn't do much for me, especially as it's so short.Waterworld - I saw it 9 years ago, and it's the same show- thank goodness! It's a great show to watch- don't miss it.Did the Studio Tour- this was different to my last time, with a few 3D bits with King Kong and Fast and Furious, as well as a few of the old bits, so it was still good to do.Enjoyed Simpsons Land (had a Duff beer at Moe's Tavern- cool!!) but didn't like the ride much- made us queasy. So did Despicable Me- don't know why Transformers didn't make us feel ill, maybe just enjoying the 'story' more. (Despicable Me and especially the Simpsons ride had tooooo much lead-in before you got to the ride. That didn't help)The Special Effects Show was a lot of fun, and nice and cool if you're there on a hot day!Did Shrek 4, which is still fun, and then we had to leave.Fun, fun, day, but not liking the simulating rides very much. Probably find for other people. Didn't need Front of Line at all to enjoy our day.

We did 9 days between each park. Both are great, and Disneyland is soooo much fun. It doesn't matter your age, you just have a great time. There are so many things to do and see that in the 9 days, we still missed out on some things, but it's easy to get around and do those you love. So may rides and parades to suit anybody, and lots of happy families together. You shouldn't have to wonder if it's worth going to Disneyland, just how many days you want to do!!

The beds are firm yet gentle, which I loved. The breakfast was good- I looove rice chex!! We were at the back, and had no noise at all. Our room got the evening sun, so if you visit during warm times, ask for a room at the side, not right at the back. (I'd asked for that room, so it was not the fault of the hotel staff.) So easy to walk to the parks. We would stay here again, for sure.

The driver, Alex, was funny with his comments along the way, and we got there in perfect timing, just before the park opened. Well worth considering.

Both tours lasted 3 hours each. Marta was very informative, spoke perfect English and she brought along lots of additional information on her tablet and a folder which she shared with us and was extremely knowledgable about everywhere we went.We were able to jump all lines as Marta had given us information beforehand for booking our tickets online and she was able to take us straight in being an official guide. This saved us lots of time which was fantastic as we had such a short time there.I absolutely recommend doing a tour with Marta. Thank you Marta!

The room is really beautiful and the staff made us feel very special from the moment we arrived. I found the staff here really made the place, they are very attentive and help you in any way they can by recommending things to do or places to eat. Thank you to Ivan and the young lady who works there (sorry didn't catch her name). They were great.I have to mention the bathroom, the Turkish bath (steam room) within the shower is AMAZING! I had one every night I was there.I couple of things made me only give it 4 stars. The first is, there was a trattoria under our room which was noisy at night until pretty late. Also there were deliveries or something really early so the room was not quiet. It was fine for me as I sleep through anything but unfortunately my hubby is a very light sleeper so this really disturbed his nights.The other reason is the floor in our shower was broken before we arrived (strip by the drain) and hadn't been fixed and the mirrored side table was cracked/chipped on top which also was still left in the room. I find that a little strange for a place with such high standards to leave a damaged furniture in a room. The location is great, only a few minutes walk down to the water where you can get waterbusses/taxis and about 10 minutes or so to St. Marks Square.Thanks for a lovely stay.

Arrived mid afternoon and it was extremely busy. Waited about 35 minutes for a table. That was fine though as we sat outside and watch the gondola's coming and going. Food was what you'd expect, predictably nice but pretty pricey. Staff were fine, not as great as I recently experienced in Vienna but ok.

Food looked like a microwave meal you'd heat up and didn't taste much better. Portions were small. My spaghetti carbonara was watery and very yellow. Just before our food was brought out to us one of the lady's who prepared the food (wearing a food prep glove on one hand) came out and was talking on her mobile phone. She was holding the phone with the hand with no glove on, sneezed onto the hand with the food prep glove on and then wiped the gloved hand down her leg and went back in and continued to work YUK!!Positives, our waiter was very nice and friendly and my chocolate milkshake was really nice. But this would not be enough to make me return.

As it was late afternoon it wasn't too busy and as we walked in the guy behind the bar shouted a big hello (in Italian) to us then over to the left a whole table of staff (who must have been having a meeting) all shouted buongiorno and all started laughing, it seemed like a really lovely atmosphere. We both had a pizza which was really nice. We asked for the bill but instead they brought over a massive jar of biscuits and a liquor (which we were not charged for). The whole atmosphere was really lovely, the staff were very friendly and looked like they were having lots of fun with each other which was really nice to see. Really enjoyed my visit! Thank you

It's pretty quick to get up there and once you are up there you can have a nice drink or food at the cafe up there with great views. You can also walk away from the cafe a bit and get great unobstructed views of the old town.

I ate here at the Brasserie a couple of times for breakfast and dinner and found it only average. The food was just ok which was really surprising to me as I had expected much more after reading all the reviews. I don't know if the management are the same as the management who run the hotel but I found the staff here not very friendly or attentive unlike in the hotel. One night whilst we went to dinner we sat at the table whilst two members of staff chatted with their backs to us in front of us and eventually I had to actually interrupt them just to ask for a menu so we could decide what we wanted. We ate here a few times out of convenience but I can't say I was overly impressed at any time which was a real shame.

I can't recommend this hotel enough.The young lady who checked us in was so helpful and friendly (I didn't get her name but she was small and fair haired) she took us up to our beautiful room which was large and had a beautiful window seat looking out to the opera house. She showed us around the room and talked to us about everything we might need to know. We were also supplied with maps for the area. We were told that kettles are no longer allowed in newer hotels and to call for boiled water and milk if we required tea which we did and it was delivered within a few minutes, quicker than I could have boiled a kettle! We did have a coffee machine in the room though. We had breakfast in our room one morning and I called just to ask for some strawberry jam and there was someone knocking on the door about 30 seconds later! Just amazing customer service.We had complimentary wine each day (4 bottles!!! 2 red and 2 white) not that we could even get through one! and also two bottles of still water and two bottles of sparkling water.We had a deluxe room with opera view, the room was lovely and extremely clean and modern with a nice sitting area. I would come back here in a heart beat. Thank you for a wonderful stay.

We sat down and was served after a few minutes by a guy who came across as pretty miserable and unfriendly. I ordered the chicken sandwich which said it came with fries. It actually came with home cooked potato wedges which I understand may be called fries here it's just not what I was expecting. The sandwich was pretty small and there weren't many "fries" but anyway they were horrible, greasy and tasteless!The chicken sandwich however was really nice and tasty. So seeing as I only enjoyed half my meal and found the staff quite unfriendly then I will only rate this place as average and wouldn't return.

I chose the hickory ribs which were really nice although weren't very warm when they arrived which was a shame (this is the only reason why I only gave it 4 stars). I still really enjoyed my meal though, the garlic chips were also really nice.Have been to different Hard rock Cafes around the world and actually think that the staff here are the friendliest I've been served by.

It was very easy to get to from the city on the green line, we got off at Schönbrunn station and it was only a few minutes walk once you come out the train station. We had already bought our tickets online which included a few of the attractions but decided to visit the loo before starting to walk around, we were charged to use the public toilets!!!! I could not believe it, but thankfully all other toilets were free so don't use the ones as you first go in on your left! The house and the Gloriette are beautiful to see but I was really disappointed with the grounds. There were weeds EVERYWHERE, the grass was full of weeds particularly. There were barely any flowers or colour, in fact they were planting up as we were there so maybe of we'd have gone tomorrow it would have looked prettier.We spent about 5 hours walking around and I'm glad I went but I have been to some beautiful grounds before in other places that are immaculate so it was disappointing to see that these grounds are not very well taken care of.
Monique140968|9638D066FF8FE2275636FCAA19BB7FB6|Hotel|Amsterdam: Pulitzer Amsterdam|4| “Lovely Hotel”|review_483215418|Spent 4 nights here recently and it's a really lovely hotel. The room we had was very small but had everything you needed. The bathroom was lovely with marble floor tiles and white subway tiles on the walls and the BEST shower I've had for a long time. The location is perfect, just a five minute walk from the Anne Frank house and easy to walk everywhere else but enough out of the way to be nice and quiet.The reason I didn't give this hotel 5 stars was that when we arrived in our room for the first time there was a dirty old plaster on the floor, also on another occasion after our room had been serviced one of the pillows that we'd left on the floor from the previous night was still in the floor even though the bed had been made up, it just seemed strange that it wasn't put back on the bed.The last thing I found disappointing was there was only one large bath towel, and the rest were medium-small. It would have been good if we could have both had a large bath towel each.Saying that though this would not stop me returning and I would definitely stay here again if I return to Amsterdam!

There are cats that are allowed to roam around the boat who actually live on the boat and are not for re-homing and then there are some in cages that they are hoping will be adopted out and given a new forever home. Some of the cats don't really like to be stroked and are a bit timid and there are some that are very affectionate. The place is only open for a couple hours a day which I think is nice, at least they are not "on show" full time. It's all run by volunteers so you give a donation before you leave so they can keep the place running. If you are a cat lover then you'd like this place, you probably only need 1/2 hour or so there but can spend as long as you like in that 2 hour period they are open.

The place was pretty quiet at that time with quite a few empty tables. The waitress we spoke to said "well we are booked out from 7pm but ok you can sit down" we immediately felt it was a bit abrupt. We sat down and she came over to take our drinks order. When she came back with my sparkling water and my husbands beer she shoved them down onto the table spilling loads of beer and just walked off, we mopped up the table!Our pizza order was then taken and delivered nice and quickly but was also practically thrown onto the table by another waiter, we started to think they were all just a bit slap dash.We watched our original waitress clear another table outside, she grabbed about three glasses quickly and just dropped one on the floor, the only thing I can think is her mind was elsewhere that day.Let's hope that today was just a bad day service wise and this is not the norm.The pizza was absolutely beautiful though and if the service was good I would have given this a 5 star rating without hesitation.
Monique140968|9638D066FF8FE2275636FCAA19BB7FB6|Restaurant|Amsterdam: PIQNIQ|3| “Nice little cafe”|review_482288880|Went to this cafe as had read good reviews on trip advisor. They have a cat called Pedro who was fast asleep in the window and as I love cats we took the table right next to him. Very cute! I ordered the scrambled egg on white bread with bacon and when it arrived the scrambled egg was in a glass and the French style bread on the side (see photo). I found it a little hard to eat. You couldn't really put the scrambled egg on the white French style bread and then easily use a knife and fork so I ended up putting my bacon in the bread which was nice and then eating the scrambled egg on its own which I didn't enjoy as it was a bit tasteless on its own. I know places like to do things differently and make them look nice but you've still got to think about how you eat it. A little disappointed.

When we arrived at the hotel the concierge welcomed us and gave us a map and talked to us about where things were in relation to the hotel, he was very informative and helpful, he walked us over to reception where we were checked in efficiently.Our room was a deluxe room on the 5th floor and just looked out directly onto a multi storey car park, we were informed of our view upon check in and asked if we'd like to upgrade for an extra $30 per night but we chose not to as we weren't planning on spending too much time in the room, we wanted to explore as much of Adelaide as we could whilst we were there.The room was clean and tidy and had everything we needed.We found the internet pretty patchy and slow and had quite a few occasions where we couldn't get logged on, especially early evening when I'm guessing lots of people were trying to get on.The hotel was in a great spot within walking distance to a lot of attractions.We used the gym, sauna and steam room which were all ok, it did take us a while to realise both the steam room and sauna needed to be switched on from outside, the sauna didn't ever really heat up. The steam room took a while to steam but once it started it was really good.We had breakfast 2 of the 4 mornings we were there. The first morning it was all good with lots of choice but the second morning it was REALLY busy and I was waiting for pancakes which I was told were coming "now" for 25 minutes! When they finally brought a small amount out, so many people were waiting that they went quickly and I ended up with two! My husband waited for his first coffee of the morning for 20 minutes and had to ask for it a number of times and his breakfast came to the table cold. Had that been the first day we ate breakfast there we would definitely not have ate there the second day.Upon check out we came out the lift to a queue of 15 people waiting to also check out, however the two people on the desk did manage to get through us in about 15 minutes. I probably would stay there again as overall it was a pleasant experience.

The waitress wasn't overly friendly, I'm not saying she was rude but not smiley and chatty or anything. We ordered a garlic bread and two small pizzas one costing $17.90 and the other $18.90, we were extremely surprised at how small they were when they arrived for that price. I don't really feel it was good value, I come from Perth and for slightly more than that price the pizzas would be way bigger. Having said that, both our pizzas were very nice and tasty.Whilst we were in there a VERY drunk man came in (he was so drunk he fell into one of their plant pots outside and stayed there for ages) and then managed to get himself up and came in to the restaurant and sat at a table right by the doors and just fell asleep (eventually) at the table. I have to say I found it a little uncomfortable. He was completely ignored by the waitress, so not asked to leave and not asked if he wanted anything so I wonder if he is a regular?? If I had seen this before I was already in I would have chosen another restaurant.

It wasn't too busy as I think we were a little later than breakfast time. My husband had the breakfast stack and I had scrambled egg on toast. Both meals were really nice, coffee was also good and staff were efficient. Would definitely eat here again.

But when we actually walked into our dome I was blown away. And so was my hubby who I don't think was expecting too much. It was beautiful. I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to holidays and where I pick to stay and always go for very modern decor if I can and the decor in the dome was up there with the best, beautiful colours and had a very relaxing feel.The dome was immaculate and had everything you could possibly need, down to BBQ, clothes horse, washing machine, dishwasher, kettle, toaster, tea, coffee, shower gel etc etcUnfortunately for us it was EXTREMELY windy when we came, so our first night was so noisy with the wind hitting the dome that we didn't sleep well but luckily the second night it calmed down and we could hear the wildlife outside and truly felt like we were camping but IN STYLE!! The bed was amazingly comfortable. Both nights we had a spa bath out on the deck and enjoyed looking up at the stars, amazing view.In the short time we were there we managed to see Busselton, Dunsborough, Yallingup and Margaret River as all are easy to drive to from the dome.I can't recommend this experience enough.

Staff were efficient, food came out nice and quickly (although as it was mid afternoon it was pretty quiet in there).I had the ribs which were really lovely and tender and my daughter had a chicken Club which she also said was very nice.Nice experience and would go again.

I have been to Universal in Florida and it is no where as big as there but still great fun. The 2 rollercoasters (Galactica) are fast and well worth it if you like the fast rides. Also the Mummy ride and the Transformer ride are a must!We paid the extra for the express pass and didn't wait more than 5 minutes for anything, in fact most of the rides we were able to get on straight away even though it was a Saturday and probably one of the busiest days to go. Well worth a visit.

It's in a great location for catching the train to various places, its attached to a good shopping centre, it's clean, staff are friendly, efficient and helpful, rooms are very comfortable and have everything you need.You can't go wrong with breakfast in 'The Edge' there's so much choice, something for everyone.This time for the first time we were members of the Pan Pacific club on the 38th floor, I was very impressed. You are entitled to various privileges throughout your stay and the afternoon tea up there was lovely. Thank you once again for making our stay so easy, as Singapore is one of my favourite places I will definitely be returning!

It's in a really convenient spot on Sentosa with a free bus service to and from a big shopping centre and the boardwalk. Also buses outside are free to get around the Island and run regularly.When we first got in our room I was a bit disappointed as there were just trees beyond the balcony so no view but I started unpacking bits and when I turned back there was a monkey sitting there looking at me on the balcony! We had quite a few visiting us daily although I have to say one was extremely perverted and couldn't stop playing with his bits and showing us!! Maybe it's just a man thing . On a serious note though I think they can be aggressive and try and get in the room for food so don't leave the balcony door open and I wouldn't leave my kids out on the balcony just in case. Great to watch through the window though.We also saw Komodo dragons and lot of peacocks around he hotel, they were lovely to see. Staff were lovely, the older lady working on the tour desk was especially helpful and kind.Breakfast buffet was big with lots of choice.Pools were great and although I came with my grown up daughter the children's pools looked amazing with the slides so I think this place would be fantastic for children.I would happily come back.

Couple of minutes to get up to the top and then maybe 5-10 minutes up there and minute to get back down. Views are pretty good though.When we joined the line there was a large group tour doing the ride and they were all having photos done. We didn't want a photo so we're just going to go past them and got shouted at by a man who we assumed worked there. We waited until they had their photos and joined the line and then more of their group came in. They tried to just push past us which was really annoying as we were all going on the same ride and you just all sit on a seat in a circle so they weren't getting anywhere quicker! We then realised the man that shouted at us was their tour guide!! Apart from other people's annoying and very rude tour guides it's probably worth doing.

You will need more than one of you and I would also maybe say bring a tripod so that you can both be in some of the shots. The lighting is really bad (too bright) on some of the walls and also they stick their signs for ideas of photos to take in silly places so that you can't avoid them being in your photo but apart from that it's pretty good fun and once we got home we managed to edit (crop out) signs so that we actually got some really cool photos. If you've got an hour and a half or so to kill it's worth doing. We managed to get tickets for half price so only $25 for the two of us, worth it at that price, but not sure I'd have paid $50.

We got there before they opened so were first in line to get our tickets. We managed to get a discount (10% I think) by showing our Singapore airlines boarding pass. Now, before we did it we asked if we were allowed to film it on the way down and they said yes, so we took photos and movies getting our equipment on and getting up there so that we could do a little movie of the whole experience. When we got up we were told to put our phones in our bags, I said that we were told we could film and they said it had to be on a strap, that's fair enough but I really wish they'd have told me that when I originally asked as we would have brought our camera with a strap rather than our iPhones. So we were really disappointed we couldn't film the experience going down. Other than that though, it was really good fun, I was quite nervous but it was absolutely fine and didn't make my stomach go at all. I recommend it for sure!
Monique140968|9638D066FF8FE2275636FCAA19BB7FB6|Hotel|Dunsborough: Dunsborough Lakes Holiday Resort and Caravan Park|1| “"Leavers" read this...”|review_446559394|The staff here are by far the worst and rudest people I have EVER dealt with in ANY industry in all my life!!! I still can not believe how they spoke to me.The lines opened up for leavers and my daughter and her friends and also myself were all trying to get through to book a cabin. My daughters line went through (after hours of trying) and her friend spoke to the staff member to make the booking. She was told "she was lucky as she'd got the last cabin".My daughter then asked me to send them $140 deposit (which I assumed was to secure the cabin), as I was now getting the information 3rd hand I emailed just to see if I could pay direct into their bank. I received an email back from Cheryl saying 'she's sorry my daughter didn't listen' (Hmmmmm first thing I thought was rude) but I had to have the cheque there by the end of the week for the ballot on 1st/2nd July. Well to me a ballot means you are going into a draw to get a place so I then assumed they hadn't actually secured their booking and it wasn't set in stone so I wanted to speak to someone rather than keep going back and forth via email. I spent a further 1/2 hour late afternoon ringing but luckily got through to actually speak to a staff member. BUT I was unlucky enough to speak to someone called Julie who is the rudest person I've ever come across. When I explained I was checking if the place had been secured or if there was still a ballot process to go through in July she abruptly and loudly said "why are you calling, your daughter was told all this". I said well actually it was her friend and we are all a bit confused now a ballot has been mentioned. She shouted "well I don't know, it depends what's she was told, I wish people would just listen" I was flabbergasted to say the least. I said I'm just asking a simple question here and you are shouting at me and she told me to "speak to the girl who had booked it (my daughters friend) and her Mum had to pay the deposit not me as its booked in her name and why was I doing it" I explained I was just going to be the one collecting everyone's money and sending off the cheque and she said "oh I don't know, people just need to not get everyone else involved I'm going to put you through to Cheryl who you've emailed" I could then hear them quite clearly saying to each other why don't people listen and why are other people getting involved and talking rudely as if I wasn't there, so by the time Cheryl came on the phone I was fuming and said how rude they both were. I asked who was their manager and she didn't answer she just kept talking over me saying she'd written everything in an email about the ballot. She said "you were all told how this process works last week" (apparently there was some information thing which had happened the week before which none of us knew anything about therefor did not know what the process was). She did then start to explain that you have to pay $140 to stay there for two nights 1st-2nd July where you then actually pay your 50% deposit for the leavers week in November. Not what I would call a ballot and what a strange way to do something??!!! You have to pay and stay there two nights in July to pay for the leavers week!!! OMG!!!! What a joke. And no Etfpos either only cash!!!! STRANGEAnyway leavers is now over and after all the hassles my daughter did say although the place wasn't that clean or in good condition that the people working there were good to them and she enjoyed herself so I think it's their phone skills they need to work on!!

I had the S'mores Brioche French Toast which was really lovely although I couldn't finish it and my husband had the eggs on sour dough which he enjoyed. Was very hot in there though and uncomfortable - didn't seem to have the aircon on just a fan over the other side of the room away from the tables which didn't help at all. Staff very nice and friendly though.

As we walked in we were shown to a table straight away. It looked really nice in there. At this point we must have been given our invisibility powers!We sat down and then was completely ignored for the next 20 minutes, we waited and waited for a menu and watched them take them to others who had come in after us and in the end we just gave up! We walked out and went somewhere else!!! Crap service!!!!

Monique140968|9638D066FF8FE2275636FCAA19BB7FB6|Hotel|Seminyak: Luna2 Studiotel|4| “Lovely quirky hotel!”|review_405171050|Loved this quirky and hip little hotel! Only 14 rooms, you almost felt like you had the place to yourself. The decor was amazing and the theme carried on throughout and was done so well.I found all the staff to be very friendly and very helpful. The manager was great at recommending great places to eat and was happy to book for us. The rooms were very well equipped including a bunch of stuff you may have forgotten (which you could purchase for a fee) like mouthwash, panadol, toothbrush etc. The shower Gel, shampoo and conditioner provided smelt really nice, but these were the only things provided, so none of the usual shower cap, sewing kit and things like that that you normally get.The rooms were cleaned very well.The pool area was nice although there were no views, just a courtyard type area. Great service round the pool at just a touch of a button which was a great.The WIFI in our first room on level 1 was great, we were then moved to a room on the top floor due to an issue which was quickly sorted by management and the WIFI in that room was not so great as it just kept dropping out all the time, although round the pool area it was good.Breakfast was nice, a very small selection in the buffet and then a menu you could choose from. We also ate an evening meal in the hotel which was just beautiful and very tasty.The actual location of this hotel was what has stopped me giving it 5 stars. It was not very easy to walk into Seminyak via the streets as they were very busy with cars and motorbikes and were very narrow with no pavements. You could however walk along the beach to get there (less than 10 minutes) and that was easy enough but we found the beach to be quite smelly and dirty which was a real shame.
Monique140968|9638D066FF8FE2275636FCAA19BB7FB6|Hotel|Bophut: Bo Phut Resort & Spa|4| “Staff here are amazing!”|review_357943379|Just spent 7 nights here. I have mixed feelings about the place so only giving the place 4 stars for reasons I will mention below.ArrivalThe first reason for this rating is our experience didn't start off great as we had arranged and paid the hotel to pick us up at the airport. Our plane arrived on time and we went out to where we were told to go and waited for about 15 minutes for pick up, after more than 15 minutes we were told by some other hotels there who were picking up people that we should try further up the slope area where there are more people picking up (one of us had already been going up and down to this point also looking) but off we went again, we then waited a further 10 minutes looking for our driver before my husband went in to the information centre where we were charged for them to call the hotel to ask where our driver was. The hotel said he was there at the airport, this is when I went back down to the original spot and found him. The hotel is only 20 minutes away and the plane was on time so it would have been nice if he could have been there for when we arrived (or soon after).Anyway we finally got to the hotel and was welcomed and apologised to (something the driver did not do). The hotel were then kind enough to give us breakfast when we got there which we were grateful for.We were also offered the complimentary jet lag massage which we enjoyed.SpaWe did book a massage later into our holiday which was very expensive and probably only average, I have had much better in lots of other places.RoomsOur room was really lovely and spacious and very clean. The products and amenities were all good. The shower gel and hair products smelt divine.StaffThe staff here are amazing!!! This is the thing that makes you forgive anything. I can't stress enough how genuinely friendly and helpful they are. Every staff member greets you, the pool guys are there in an instant when you want to move your umbrella or bed or anything and the restaurant staff are also lovely, a special mention to Natty who greeted us every day with a lovely smile and was very welcoming. Food/Restaurant All food we had there was good and well priced compared to back home. The staff amazingly remember what drinks you want (if you tend to have the same) and bring over a little stool for your bag. They are always there when you need them but not hanging around you.GroundsThe gardens are well looked after although the pool probably needs some maintenance along with the decking around the pool which on the first day my husband (who is no way a heavy man) fell through cutting his ankle (another reason for my lower rating). Once again they were there in an instant and very apologetic. The decking seemed very bouncy in certain areas which you could feel as people walked along whilst you were on your sunbed and I think it needs a lot of TLC.BeachThe beach has very coarse sand and does hurt your feet to walk on, so our first walk to Fishermans Village took a while. The sea is lovely and warm but does get deep quite quickly, something to keep in mind for little ones.Fishermans VillageThere is a pavement out the front of the hotel that makes it much easier to walk to Fishermans Village, it's less than a 10 minute walk and worth a trip. The Friday night markets are a good time to go to sample the local foods including fried insects eeeeek!InternetInternet was a bit patchy, sometimes fast and sometimes you couldn't get connected.Sunbeds Other reviews complained about the limited number of sunbeds, there seemed enough sunbeds to me although they were SO uncomfortable!!! They look so thick and you think they are going to be nice and soft but it was like sitting on a plank of wood all day. No one else seems to have mentioned this in their reviews so maybe they are new sunbeds or maybe it's just me but my back did not like them at all.Overall I did have a lovely break here, mainly because of the staff being so lovely and attentive so thank you.

Although our main waiter was fairly polite, he wasn't overly friendly.We waited quite a long time for our breakfast although our drinks came quickly. I had asked for extra milk with my tea and as with most places I go to, I did not get it first time so I asked a passing waitress if I could have more, it took a long while but she finally came back with it and just kind of slammed it down on the table and walked off, she didn't say a word.The food was mixed, someone had waffles which they loved, a couple of people had granola which they loved and then a couple of us had various egg dishes which were not great, my toast was dry and boring, in fact it tasted stale, I had to ask for some butter (which I was surprised it didn't comeWith) but this still didn't help.I probably would try it again due to some people liking what they had, but I do think the service could be a lot better.

Found it on the Internet after just searching day spas in Perth.I left plenty of time and had planned to get there about 3/4 hour before our massage was due to start to relax and enjoy the grounds that looked lovely on their website.Unfortunately there was an accident on the freeway earlier so it ended up taking us just over 1 1/2 hours to get there instead of just the 40 minutes it should have, meaning we literally arrived 5 minutes after our massage was due to start!!! (Definitely needed a massage by then!!)They were wonderful, they told us we could sort out our payment at the end so as not to take time off our massages and took us to the lake where the three of us enjoyed our massage together with a beautiful outlook.The massages were wonderful and the location was just stunning. They were even kind enough to give us our full hour even though we were a little late. Thank you for that.The masseurs were very friendly and polite and the whole experience was just a really pleasurable one.I will definitely be back!!!

The room was large, clean,comfortable and had a nice balcony. The wifi in the room was a little dodgy at times.The breakfast buffet had a nice variety and was tasty.The 2 pools were both very nice and we spent many an afternoon in them escaping the heat. The beach is right across the road but is a little dirty so we preferred the pools. The pool bar was also a nice addition.The whole resort is beautifully designed with many flowers and plants along the pathways and lovely manicured lawns and gardens.All of the staff we encountered were very helpful. We were able to book activities such as quad biking and white water rafting at the tour desk. The front desk gave us a welcome drink and cool towel on arrival and organised our transfer to the airport on the last day.The location in good, on the main street of Legian where there are many restaurants and markets a few minutes walk away which we visited often.We would stay here again.

There was a variety of rides to suit everyones interests. Our favourite ride was The Mummy! The architecture and decorations around the park were very impressive, it looked almost as if we were really in the movies. You will definitely need almost a whole day here if you want to see and do everything. Queueing times for rides were not too bad when we visited, usually not having to wait any more than 20 minutes per ride. The exception to this was the very popular Jurassic Park river ride, for which we waited about 1.5 hours in the afternoon, so maybe try and get to this one early in the day.There were a variety of food outlets and shops around the park.It was very easy to get to the park via the monorail to Sentosa Island. The monorail stop is right next to the park.

The hotel itself is huge, with multiple bars and restaurants, a pool, and a sauna. The view from the indoor pool on the roof is fantastic!The room was beautiful and modern. I could not fault it. The king bed was very comfortable and the whole room very clean.The room service food was okay but nothing special, while the daily breakfast buffet had a huge variety of food from every culture. It was delicious.This hotel is well situated if you are attending an event within the hotel or at the convention centre, but is otherwise about a 20-30 minute taxi ride from the heart of Hanoi.I would definitely stay here again.

Despite it being very busy, we were able to listen to our instructor comfortably and felt much more confident on the slopes by the end of the day.We found it difficult to get a seat inside for lunch, so had to sit outside, which was okay but not ideal. The food and drinks on offer were quite overpriced.

The kitchenette was well stocked and we were able to cook multiple meals ourselves.The wifi worked well.The location is very good. We often walked into the city centre. It is a downhill walk, talking under 10 minutes. Coming back to the hotel is a bit more of a challenge walking up the hill, but nothing too unmanageable for most.

It is rather small with only one room displaying some figures and collectables to purchase, as well as a small theatre where an informational video is displayed. The trolls on display outside the entrance were quite cool. Good to see once, but probably wouldn't go again.

Very spacious and clean throughout, except for some stains on the carpet. Soft bed. Nice view towards Parramatta. No issues with noise apart from some slight sounds coming from a locked door in the corner, which must have been an interconnecting room. Check in and check out were very smooth. We were happy with this hotel and would stay again.

The waiting time for food to be serve was approx 30-40 mins. I tried to be understanding since there was quite a lot of people but when our order arrived it was raw and cold inside. So then again we need to wait for another 20 mins. I was really disappointed. The guests beside our table also complained since they waited for more than 40 minsThe guests infront of our table also complained for the wrong billIt took them atleast 15 mins to finish our bill and another 15 mins to complete our take-out. If I didn't approach the counter they would've given us the wrong take-out.This restaurant was so disorganized.The food was so-so.I would not recommend this place to anyone.

Every course was well presented and tasted divine.If you can get a reservation whilst in the area you must try the food here for sure. There was only one dish that we did not like from the whole meal which was one of the deserts which looked some sort of cake with different layers, it did not taste great but other than that the food was amazing.The service was great, attentive and very in tune with our likes and dislikes which was evident in the dishes that were presented. The restaurant lived up to its reputation of high end dining.

The area is vast and you will not get bored as there is so much to see and discover.

They have a great choice of cocktails and we enjoyed some plum Sake which was recommended - it ht the spot as a after dinner shot

The service is attentive and friendly - the waitress helped us with recommendations and advising which dishes are currently not being served.The food is delicious, we tried some tapas / sharing dishes which were very tasty. We did however try the Kimchi Tapas and it is definitely an acquired taste, we found the texture and taste odd so wasn't one of our best dishes we tried. The weather outside was freezing and icy so it was great to step inside this gem and get warmed up wit the lovely heart dishes and atmosphere.

It has a very homey British atmosphere and decorThe rooms are adequate however I the heating in my room was not working hence the rating.The desk was great in providing blankets and an electric heater - unfortunately it was not working either.This whole saga made for an interesting night as it meant I lost out on a couple hours sleep trying to make myself warm and comfortable in the room. The person on front desk moved me to a suite and it was perfect, lovely and warm and spacious, it was a great night's sleep once I eventually got my head down.The situation with the heating not working was quite stressful when you are tired and have to be up early the next day for work, however the staff on duty that night dealt with it professionally and courteously, I could not have asked for any better service from them. The service was excellent.I would definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting Birmingham and want to experience good service and a nice homely comfortable stay.

The seating was little on the small side luckily we got down there early so never had any trouble.The rooms were really well decorated, it was odd that they had two single beds next to each other to make a double bed but each bed had there own duvet.It was nice and clean and well maintained.I would definitely stay here again if we were looking for a hotel in Helsinki.

It helped that we had a polish speaking friend who had organised the trip with the hotel beforehand to accommodate for us.The champagne (non alcoholic for non drinkers) reception upon arrival was well executed with us checked in very quickly.We went to the bar to get some food and the service was not great. Vege options were sparse, and the waiter forgot 3 of the dishes. The food took quite a while to come out which meant that we spent a good few hours waiting for food and having lunch.The spa is lovely and very well priced, I enjoyed a massage but found it odd that they only worked on my legs and back, not my arms or front of legs or stomach however the time was up so I didn't question this. The pressure of the massage was just right and they did a great job.Dinner was organised in the main restaurant and the Polish friend had made requested for a special vegetarian menu for us.We hired out the hot tub in the evening,again, very reasonably priced and they organised this fantastically for us. We also organised a private dining dinner on one of the other evenings which again the service was fantastic and the attention to detail was perfect. The food was of the highest standard, and all us enjoyed every mouthful immensely.Our time here was made better by the views and service (except the bar experience on the first day) however I am not sure how well they would have accommodated for vegetarians had our friend not been to the hotel the month previous to organise our trip with them.

It was all that you expect of a luxury hotel, It is grand and service is impeccable. We stopped for coffee's and cake and they did not disappoint. We ordered a selection of cakes and each mouthful was delectable. Each one of the 8 girls have high standards and they we were all impressed with the cake and drinks selection on offer. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.

The cheesecake was also very nice - it reminded us of a strawberry split with some cake... fantastic food and atmosphere.The service was also impeccable, the food arrived quickly and was piping hot and fresh. Great views of the lake if you sit in the window booths.

We go some great pics of us on the frozen lake with a beautiful backdrop of the mountains. We took a walk around the lake and it is beautiful from every angle with different views. The path is pretty clear and little rugged so would recommend trainers or walking boots in the cold. there are lovely places to stop off on the way round, you could easily spend half a day walking around the lake exploring and stopping off to Kempinski and restaurants/bars along the way.

We only spent one night out in obidos, but other than that we were in the resort every evening.The pool is a nice temperature and the hot tub just nearby is great to hop in between both, annoying that you have to wear caps in the actual pool though.We went for some spa treatments and they were excellent. The lady on the desk was helpful in choosing the treatments. The treatments themselves were also very well executed, I enjoyed every moment of them even if I nodded off! that is a sure fire sign that they were great.The bar is busy most evening, food was average but we were tired of it by the 2nd evening, we found there wasnt a huge amount of choice for vegetarian and they were not really accommodating. The food was also quite salty, we ordered chips and actually had to send them back as they were too salty.The cleaning of the rooms was average and the little touches that you would expect of this resort were missing. The shower cap was ripped and was never replaced, shower gel and soaps were also not replaced. For a marriott resort we would have expected full toiletries of earbuds and cotton pads but we didn't have these.Generally a good stay but the little touches of making it an amazing stay were missing.

The Pastéis de Nata were so tasty we wanted to stop by there on the way back to get more but we did not have time.A lovely cafe that you can sit and eat the pastries or you can walk abit further down and take a rest in the square and enjoy these tasty treats.Whilst in Portugal Pastéis de Nata are a must try and we think we found the best that they have to offer.They were warm, sweet and gooey and the pastry was melt in the mouth flaky. Amazing Pastéis de Nata

There are a fair few steps to get to the top floor and the waiter was great in making sure we had everything we needed - nothing was too much trouble.The food - well it was the best pasta and pizza dishes we have had in a while. There are a few vege dishes to choose from but they are pretty accommodating generally. - we got the penne with vegetables in a spicy sauce, pasta was cooked perfectly al-dente and the vege/mushroom./margherita pizza's were thin, crispy and topped well. the cannelloni was nice, a little bit too cheesy for me and not enough tomato sauce but overall the food was really tasty. The portions were of a good size too, definitely worth a visit if you are in the area and fancy Italian food

We visited all the caves and climbed the step to the temple.We had psyched ourselves for it to be more difficult that it was. Do make sure you take a bottle of water to keep you hydrated if you do decide to climb to the temple in the hill.This is an attraction where you have to cover up so if you have a sarong you can take that is ideal as it will save you the trouble when you get there.The statues are beautiful and the monkeys are roaming around care free.There are other exhibitions that you can pay and visit, we enjoyed making the most and visiting these too.there is a zoo type of thing there but we didn't go in and visit it.

The whole experience was well organised.n The views from the towers are incredible and it is a pretty good experience whilst visiting KL.It is a whole lot is metal and glass but the feeling inside when you are looking out is still pretty amazing. You can see things that you may not visit or see whilst on the ground - scope out where else you would like to visit.I would definitely say it is worth a visit whilst in KL if you have time.

It was great to visit and see but I would not want to do it again.It was so unbelievably busy that it was difficult to walk and navigate down and the smell from the food stalls was sickening, we walked up and then left the area as it was all abit too much to take.Great if you ware bargain hunting and out for cheap finds, and don't mind being shoved around. Lots of fake 'designer' gear on offer here.

And FOOD.On the whole the food looked tasty, there was the odd stall where the food was abit smelly but generally each food stall looked like they took care in the preparation on the food.If I was not vegetarian and eaten dinner before we went, I would probably have been more adventurous in trying some of the dishes on offer.The practices seemed very clean and proper it was merely the lack of understanding of the ingredients in the food that meant we did not try any.You can spend hours here looking at everything, and exploring the lil alley ways to see what else is around. We spent a couple of hours here but were pretty tired and wet so headed back to our hotel.You must take some time out to see this place whilst visiting Taipai, it is all a part of the experience and culture and cannot be missed.

Make sure you go here hungry as it will not disappoint.They have a nice area where you can go and take photo's just outside the main area.They have really captured the old English look and feel fantastically, the deco is quaint and really does add to the experience.We went during the day and they had fans placed outside to keep guest comfortable.They offer Asian, italian and english dishes so there is something for everyone.If you are in the a area do not miss this place.

There were not very many vegetarian dishes on the menu so we picked a couple. The dishes were very tasty and a good size. The service (Elyzabeth) at this place was great, one of the staff spoke good English so was very helped us with some questions we had about the area and things to do. We were not aware but there was a typhoon on its way so we would not be able to do many of the attractions we had planned for the next day. She advised what would be good alternatives and places to go to. She made this a better experience.

Cool and surreal experience to see them from up close like that.You can tell that they are well trained and treated well by the staff.We really enjoyed sitting inside the area and watching them play outside, you can see their own individual characters and the way they interact with the each other and the keeper.The sanctuary is out of the way so a taxi or bus is the ideal way to get there. We didn't know how long we wanted to stay as we had our flight back so we got a one way taxi, we managed to flag a taxi on the way back as there were more people arriving for the afternoon feed. Would be ideal to hire a taxi for the entire time if you are going for the afternoon feed as you may not be able to catch a taxi after this time.

It is a very unique place to experience, it feels like you are stepping back in time, the taxi's are very primitive and the people seem to live very simple lives and seem very humble.The staff were friendly and helpful, the hotel was nice and to the standard expected.The room was a good size and clean, the scenery from the bar is lovely over looking the bay.

It s lovely to walk around and see what is on offer here.

The staff were very good in helping us ensure we got good value for money in our ticket option. The music and lights when a train arrives is great! It ensures that the commuters with their heads down on their phones know that the train is arriving. The sounds is similar to computer games so makes the experience really fun.Most places are easy to reach by metro and abit of walking. It definitely meant that we got to see more of the local culture and fashion.

We made do with cereal and cake and coffee.

We got upgraded and the room was absolutely fantastic...The reception left much to be desired! We waited 20/40mins in a queue at around midnight to check in. All the while the phone was ringing out unanswered as they were so under staffed.Everyday we saw long queues as the reception desk always seemed to be understaffed.We had issues with the keycards working and had to wait in a 30minute queue to get it replaced only for it not to work and having to queue again.Over all we loved the hotel, and at times the service by staff was great... helping to get a taxi, find out how to get to places etc. Other times the staff and service was so dire that we wanted to scream...Wouldn't say it was great, at times appalling... but it has the potential to be fantastic.Great location too... short walk to the metro station.

What a blessing... The buns were amazing, the sides were tasty, the drinks were fresh and the piece de rèsistance was the cake - brown rice cheesecake - every mouth was divine.I would most certainly recommend a visit to this quirky place.

We could not fault this place on any way.The villa is located around 10minutes from Ubud town in a field which is further out, which we felt added to the experience. The villa provides transit to Ubud town which runs regularly and they also pick you up at a specified time according to the scheduled times. It is walking distance however the roads are very steep and windy so would recommend using the transportation or booking your own cab. Unfortunately as we were doing so much sightseeing whilst were in Ubud, we did not get chance to make use of the villa facilities.

It is very easy to buy tickets and if you find it difficult there will be an official from the MRT Company to help and from our personal experience if you just a local they definitely will help you.During the rush hour which is about ( 8 to 9 in the morning / 5 – 6 in the evening) it can get very crowded. We used the MRT for all our traveling during our stay. It is safe but you need to be aware of your surrounding when traveling.

During the day time the view is good to get an idea of the tourist attraction in the surrounding area. This is place has boarding pass privileges if you travel Singapore air lines (they said this was not valid on public holidays did not see any comment about this on their web site though). If it is your first time to the location and will be visiting the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay and other tourist attractions around the wheel a day time visit would be best as you will be able to get an idea of the other location in relation to the Singapore flyer. Also there is hawker center at the base of the flyer, we wanted to have a meal there but the place did not look very clean.This is definitely a highlight on a visit to Singapore. The closes MRT is Promenade. Travelled on 25 December 2016.

We enjoyed all the attractions. We bought the tickets on line with the express pass. This is the best option to cut the time spent in ques. Also note the express pass is dynamically priced and can go up in price closer to the day you want to visit. Be prepared to spend the whole day at Universal Studios as you will not have time to see other attractions on Santosa. We used the Satosa express from Vivo City and if you are going on the Santosa express line, be prepared for a long queue and if it is a public holiday it can get very crowded.Went on the 26th of December 2016

It was great experience. There is a lift to the top of the cloud forest which has long queues and for those who are able it is best to take the stairs which is faster.The Flower Dome, this is more leisurely compared to the cloud forest. Please be prepared to spend to spend some time here to take in what you see. It was very calming to look at and study the flowers as you get to see flowers which you rarely see.Overall the place has a lot of photographic opportunities and be prepared to spend at least half a day to take in what you see, If not it’s not worth it.Take note of the weather before you decided if you should start with a walk around of the outdoor gardens or the conservatories. There is also a shuttle service from the Gardens to the nearest MRT (Bayfront) for which you need to pay for which is good on a rainy day. This is located near the entrance to the conservatories.

The suite smelled like sour sweat. Furniture and carpets in bad condition the view to Clarke Key not really visible because of the really dirty windows... On the way to change the room I got patronized by the porter who told me that wouldn't be possible... After complaining we could change, the view was gone but as we couldn't see much anyway we didn't bother. The second suite was not smelling and a bit better in condition but outside it seemed to feel apart (see pix). Worst experience in a Hotel ever! They seriously need a renovation!

But the rooms are crazy small, we could not adjust in-spite of being prepared for it. The walls are thin and the washroom is tiny. Avoid booking the breakfast as the spread is below average and there are many options around the hotel.The location being close to Lavender MRT station and they provided an early check-in were the only positive factors.

He would just say its on the way and ignore.Finally after almost an hour we paid and left. This place has been good eat-out for many years now, but it would be hard to continue much longer the serving staff behaves.

However, the staff offered us upgrade at room only basis for around Rs 4000 per night but misguided and never offered the upgrade option for 2 nights including spa and meals for the same price which we later came across in the Guidebook available in the room. One of these 'new rooms' had bed bugs and the staff replaced the bedding happily on the complaint but its surprising to see such issues for starters.Its 2017, who charges for WiFi? I saw tiny restaurants on the mall road providing free wifi.Who limits the steam sauna usage just once during the entire stay?The heated pool is just lukewarm these days. The gaming room doesn't seem to be upgraded for years.The food is nothing special for the exorbitant prices though the buffet breakfast spread was respectable.They offered us a free pineapple cake on my wife's birthday but as we wanted chocolate flavor we were asked to pay but the unfortunate thing was the cake was requested to be delivered at 11:45 pm and actually delivered at 12:15 am in the midst of continuous follow up calls from 11:45 onward.All our complaints obviously went to deaf ears.This place has lost its charm, BIG-TIME..!! Just FYI, my review cannot begin to state the horrid time we had.Surely not going back to any Jaypee properties in the future..!!

This hotel is nicely located with a bus stop right outside, 3 min walk to the Chinatown MRT and 8 min walk to Clarke quay. The rooms were spacious compared to Singapore standards.The staff is super friendly and helpful, special mention for Pauline at the executive lounge. Recommended hotel, will be back..!!!

Ultra-disappointing..!! Had booked 3 rooms including the NYE celebration for the 31st of December 2016.I understand the hotel occupancy was higher than usual, but a customer service standard has to be maintained by a renowned hotel chain.1. Once, I paid the entire advance for the bookings, the hotel booking contact was least interested in picking up my calls/ respond to emails or ensure after several requests that the payment is reflected in my Hhonors membership (still the entire payment is not reflected)2. My booking included wifi but the operator at the reception did not believe it for some reason. Upon her request when I shared the email, she said her supervisor was not around, and she would call me back. After reaching out to her about 3-4 times i had to walk down to the reception to get wifi activated (not on the basis of booking but because of hhonors membership...weird)`3. It took 4 calls and about 90 minutes to get 4 glasses (empty glasses) to our room and the room service after several requests refused to activate the fridge.Why would you lock the fridges in every room and why can't you open them on the request of the room guests? 4. The breakfast in one word was a 'Mela'. Though the refills were continuous, it was hard to find a seat or locate a hotel staff to assist.5. While checking out, i was handed over a bill already paid by friend who checked out from a different room - Honest mistake but clear mismanagement..!There were other minor issues including the room key not working twice for one of our rooms (some issue with the door battery, they changed it but took their time).The NYE celebration party had its own pros and cons, but this is already a long long review..!!

The food was pretty average too, the breakfast spread was respectable while the the lunch spread was below par and the in room dining in-spite of being expensive was nothing special.The pool was dirty and i did not bother to take a dip. The spa was a tad disappointing though they offered a 20% discount to hotel guests.Would rather prefer a heritage hotel or a luxury hotel i am in Jaipur next time as the hotel is not close to any of those parameters.

Cons : The service is slow (understandable given the quality of food), the stuffed crabs were avoidable, prices are on the higher side. Also the sunset would be better if they served hookahs too :) (again understandable to maintain the sanity of the place). Also the bartender needs to learn to serve a better jagerbomb.

Add to it pathetic service.Eat out at the aunties right opposite curlies towards the beach for some yummy egg buns and maggie.There are too many things to do and places to go in Goa, and i in my mind, at this point of time, am convinced of not going here again.Go there only for the legacy or the view of the beach - the sunset is pretty cool, though i was there late in the evening this time around.

The entrance is fab..! Once you are inside, it is pretty crowded and an hour into the museum i was pretty bored, realizing this is only for the people who love art & history. Soon after, my wife started reading those stories on the display screens and narrate fun facts to me...it started to get intriguing and by the end of the day was not disappointed.The point i am trying to make is, with no knowledge of the history and no interest in art, this was not the worst place even me...so my guess is, a lot of people would love it..!!Although i still stick to the fact that Monalisa is over-rated.This place is huge, spread across floors and involves a lot of walking. Remember to carry a bottle of water and energy bars.

This place is highly overrated and overpriced, the walking paths are not even stoned , their is dead grass in the park and litter all over, pick pockets and people trying to sell cheap Eiffel towers and drinks plus the night transport system is not strong around the milestone.Ignored most of the stuff on my first visit as it is like living the dream and feeling the place.The authorities need to pull up their socks and make it more 'visit-able' and organised.

Take the 30 baht ferry to the island (an extra half hour but way cheaper than the speed boat) and rent a sun bed for 100 Baht on the ever so Chrystal clear beaches (Tawaen is pretty good). Take a dip, some coconut water and re-energize for the evening again. Again if you are not hungover, you always have water sports to enjoy. The last ferry to Pattaya leaves somewhere around 5 pm.Way better and cleaner than Pattaya beach. All in all a good trip if you are in Pattaya!!

On our first visit we tried the Butter Chicken, Dal Makhni, variety of breads (loved the cheese naan). The food was too good to describe, and would give even the best restaurants in Delhi a run for their money. The service and ambiance are good too.However, the second time I visited, we tried the Baigan Bharta & Paneer Butter Masala, and asked the dishes to be spicy (like the last time), however the bharta was full of green chillies and not edible(the paneer wasn't great either). I did inform the staff but given we had requested for spicy that was of no help. The only reason, not rating it 5.A tad expensive too.

The speakers would blast your room till 2 in the night and no way you can sleep in there. The upgrade no doubt was a sham but being a night person I did not mind as most of the nights you party beyond 2 in Pattaya.Having stayed at the Hilton in Bangkok the previous week, the Hotel and the room offered all (maybe even more) facilities at Hilton. The room was pretty big too but the staff not at all courteous. Stayed for 5 days and don't remember a single staff passing a smile once except the restaurant team. While checking out i needed a ride to the bus station, i was told they can arrange a taxi for 200-250 baht, which was strange as it was not a metered taxi. The bell boy came with a taxi and asked me to pay 350 baht which was shocking for a small distance, but i let it go. While boarding the taxi i saw the cab driver slip a 100 baht note to the bell boy. Says it all about the staff. Its a terrific property but the staff rating would be 1 on 5.Location is just 100m off the beach road and a 5 min(10 baht) tuk-tuk ride to the walking street. Lots of restaurants/bars/ malls/markets around. The WiFi was average, the buffet breakfast for 200 baht a person had a really good spread and the food we tried during our stay was above average.

Upon my arrival - after a long taxi drive(place is a bit far from sukhumvit), i was informed my mildly rugged jeans is not acceptable. After several minutes of discussion, left the building(thinking of returning back) and just outside was a women renting clothes for the skybar with a board which read 'Need clothes, skybar is my friend' or something like that. It was evident she had some connection with the staff, renting at prices thrice the cost- cheap gimmicks for a reputable bar. Still decided to rent a trouser and give the place another shot. Note, when i was leaving Europeans were walking in knickers and that was acceptable as Smart Casuals.The decor is easily the best of the sky bars in Bangkok. They do not charge an entry fee but the drink prices are steep enough to cover a lot more than the entry.After a couple of drinks at the bar,decided to head towards the main deck when i was stopped and told we had to have drinks to be there - while most of the people seemed empty handed and in fact they had a bar right there. Bought another drink(which in any case i had to) but by this time you cannot enjoy the view one bit.The rude staff assured we had a terrible night.Avoid if you are an Asian.

The animals are trained to perfection and the entertainment level is high. With a huge number of Indian crowd in the stands they added an Indian touch to things in the wait time to the show, with people dancing crazy...fun to watch! The to and fro 1 hour drive from the city is worthy of the place.The food quality was terrible, outright terrible - the only reason I wouldn't rate it 5. Even if you get free food with your ticket it is recommended to get your own food(to my surprise they don't thoroughly check if you get outside food or feed the animals).The car safari at the end is very avoidable.

(add the trademark double tree cookies as well)Very good location, a 5 minute walk to the BTS. The restaurant offered off menu options when requested. The open air pool was a delight and they had a fitness center as well. Apparently they had some complimentary drinks at the pool bar for Gold and Platinum members from 6 to 8 pm daily. Modern rooms with all amenities and a amazing view.The only miss for me was a spa center within the Hotel. A bit of communication gap with the room service staff but admissible. Another minor miss was,request for separate bills for the stay, but realized it post check out. All in all a very terrific place to stay in Bangkok.

Huge queue to get in, steep price and my personal take - very avoidable for someone who has visited the Tussaud's once anywhere in the world - no fun at all. I would still rate it 3 stars for a first time visitor. Also, the Marvel 3-D show at the end is a savior.

The Superior rooms are big, modern and nicely furnished. Other Facilities including the Spa, pool, couple of restaurants, coffee shop and the bar live up-to the brand name. Though from a tourist point of view not the best location, the service is not impeccable as well.

Average sized modern rooms, helpful staff and really good food at the restaurant(Asia alive) ranging from Mughlai to Authentic Chinese and an excellent Bar right next it as well. Only downside is the location - far from Delhi as well as major areas of Gurgaon. Also no access to public transport in the vicinity.

Major tourist spot - with all sorts of HoHo, Half day, city tour buses taking you there..so mostly crowded. Book in advance or be ready for the long queue to buy tickets, and another one to enter. The entrance fee not very high seems okay to pay when that is being used for the still under construction revelation it will be in about a decade.

The location is a bit off - away from the city center and a good 20 minute walk from the beach. The view from the rooms are really good as well as quality of the rooms is top notch without a doubt. One of the reasons for the poor rating is the service..When inquired (never offered) about the loyalty program, I was told i can join right away and would get the credit for the current stay as well, but never got any confirmation/ email/ member id after filling up the required forms. Average breakfast. Not worth the price by any means.Not the best location + Not even average service + $$$$ = Avoidable

The highlight though was the Indian restaurant - superb food, breakfast too had a nice spread.

Not the best but a pretty good location to stay. However, the rooms were really small for the price and never really went back their when I made several visits to the city. If you get a good deal, an average place to stay.

All in all a perfect family holiday resort. The food is good but the quality of buffet meals is a grey area for me..!! Recommended!

Sordnaxela|DE44459A99806E4FF719F7B8894E0A28|Hotel|Heraklion: Agapi Beach Hotel|4| “Well-located all-inclusive”|review_507543165|There isn't much to fault with the Agapi Beach. The problem is that last year we stayed at the five star fully inclusive Ikos Oceania which really was outstanding.The location of the Agapi was good as one could walk to many souvenir shops and cafes if a change of scenery was required. The beach was of a good size and if the water was calm and clear it was a great place to do some snorkelling and we even spotted an octopus. A few guests got stung by sea-urchins so beach shoes is a necessity.The main swimming pool is a good size, the water temperature perfect and there are also a couple of smaller quieter pools. With regards to meal-times there is a good amount of choice to suit everyone. Perhaps sometimes a few too many pork dishes for our liking but that's probably to please the majority of the guests (mostly German). There is food served throughout the day and fresh pancakes at breakfast and tea-time.The biggest disappointment for us were the lack of fresh juices as most of the carton juices contained sugar. Also there were no crushed-ice cocktails included in the AI package. The pina-colada we tried was very poor compared to the type of cocktails we have had in the Caribbean and also at the Ikos last year.So with regards to the rooms...the premium sea-view room was lovely- perhaps a little small. The standard bungalow had more space but fairly basic in its appearance and the standard hotel room was really depressing and similar to student accommodation. Also need to mention that the beds are made up the German way as two singles. The lifts to the rooms could also be a bit temperamental at times.The animation team need to be mentioned. These poor guys work from 8am (6 if they made the breakfast pancakes- strange for entertainers to have to do this !) and often work past midnight trying to keep us all entertained. The guests aren't really the 'fun' type. I did a dance class on my own which was good fun and at the disco there must have been at the most three people on the dance floor! For the most part the staff were all friendly and helpful (apart from the one guy who used 'psssst' to address my brother to check if he was a guest at the hotel.)Overall we had an enjoyable stay and would recommend to those looking for a good value all-inclusive holiday.
Sordnaxela|DE44459A99806E4FF719F7B8894E0A28|Hotel|Singapore: Hotel Jen Tanglin Singapore|3| “Mediocre hotel”|review_461068164|Based on the reviews here I had really high expectations of the hotel. The first disappointment is that the room was far too small for a family of three and there was barely enough room to move.The location is a bit too far from Orchard Road and the nearest MRT although there is a free hourly shuttle. The other disappointment was that the food court next door in the Tanglin Mall mentioned in some of the reviews was shut (due to reopen April 2017). On our first night the concierge recommended a food court to eat near the Forum Mall but I can't remember its name- just that it in the basement of some 'Adult' clubs and the food was not great.The breakfast in the hotel made up for the small rooms as there was a fair variety of dishes. There could have been some more fresh tropical fruit rather than the basic apples and bananas.The pool was a good size but it was a bit too cold for swimming, even though the outside temperature was in the 30s.The bathroom again was small but the toiletries selection were good.You would probably be better off staying in a hotel near an MRT as Singapore is so easy to get around that way. There is one being built near the hotel but it won't be ready until 2019.We left the hotel after three days to move on to the Hard Rock in Sentosa which was far better but unfair to compare the two as they are so different and offer different needs.

We arrived from our three day city break at around 1pm and were pleased to find there was a room available. We had a lovely view of the harbour with no balcony. We found the room incredibly spacious and were delighted to find the pullout bed for our son. I'm really fussy when it comes to rooms and I loved the modern design, I'm not sure why someone would describe the rooms as being similar to a motel room, far from it. There are tea and coffee making facilities in the room too.The other surprise is that the hotel now has free guest wifi! It's great to hear that the management listen to the feedback from guests and recently made that change. The smartphone addition in the room was also great but sadly the UK didn't qualify for free international calls.The shower room was of a good size but the toiletries were in large bottles and ladies, there was no hair conditioner or body lotion from what I can remember.The pool was awesome and really warm to swim in. Our little boy loved it. We had tickets to Universal, sea aquarium and aqua park included in our three day stay so couldn't enjoy the pool as much as we had liked to.The only negative comment my husband made was that his bath towel was a bit scratchy and we both noticed that we could hear the adjoining room a bit too much.I can't comment on the breakfast or if the price had improved as I forgot to check and went out to breakfast in the morning or ate croissants and fruit bought from Vivo City.This morning was our first back in the UK and our son woke up crying that he wanted to go back to the hotel in Singapore and I'm sure one day he will!

The rooms were spotless, the quality of the food was superb and the staff were exceptional. The sea water was clear and so warm for swimming. We didn't notice any sea urchins, though there may have been some further afield. The swimming pool was rarely overcrowded and inflatables were allowed too, though you would need your own pump to blow them up.We ate in Ouzo, The Provence, the Asian restaurant and did the dine out. The best restaurants were Ouzo and the dine out in the town.Staff deserving a mention for excellence were Vangelis, Georgiou (pool) and Sylvia (Asian restaurant)We would definitely visit again, and we have never said that before about any of our past holiday resorts.

Our designated waiter was incredible and made our little boy a fish and a bird out of woven grass.We snorkelled close to the shore with our three year old and saw some lovely fish. The New Years Eve party was amazing, with a great atmosphere, though the DJ refused to play Happy for our three year old!The only disappointment was our room, but they all should be refurbished by now so all in all you should have the perfect stay.

Taxi to the hotel cost just under €20 from the airport.The staff were friendly, the room was spacious and clean and the location was great. It took us 20 minutes to walk to the beach with our four year old.We enjoyed the swimming pool, though it could get a bit crowded at times. Would recommend the bed and breakfast option as breakfast offered a very good selection with omelettes and pancakes available to order.

The facilities in the hotel were great and we had to use to our advantage as the weather outside was appaulling. We disagree with the other reviews and would highly recommend the hotel for children. The hotel as a well-equipped playroom and the Holmes Place fitness centre allows children in the pool at designated times.The only downside to our room is that there was no kettle available. Drinks in the hotel were expensive but there is a supermarket 10 mins walk away.The beach opposite was small and covered in dog excrement so would not advise allowing children to play in the sand.Other than that, would recommend the Miragem.

We caught the number 54 shuttle from the station easily enough. Check-in was straightforward but when we went to our room which was supposed to be newly refurbished we noticed lots of white marks on the bathroom tiles. Upon closer inspection, we discovered that a few of the tiles were not stuck to the ground and could have caused injury to ones foot. This matter was resolved and we had no other complaints about the room. Overall, the hotel is not clean and in my opinion it never will be until they get some harder working housekeeping staff in. The carpets were not hoovered properly and plates were left outside rooms for hours. These comments are left time and time again on Tripadvisor and Aude kindly acknowledges them but nothing changes. On the plus side I would still recommend this hotel for families. The pool with slides is great, the soft play is fantastic and the colourful themed decor throughout the hotel really livens it up. The breakfast has a great selection, and the fruit is fresh too. Staff were all friendly and helpful. It's just a shame that the hotel isn't maintained all that well.

It was also quite close to the Warner Park which we visited and there were a few families staying there for that reason. The staff were helpful and friendly, hotel was clean and as depicted in photographs. My only criticism is that the breakfast was truly awful. There was nothing cooked, no fresh fruit and the juice was all artificial. The hotel is good for kids as there is a small slide park across the road, and a soft play in the small shopping mall round the corner that opens after 5.

We had to pay extra for the locker (€4) and they even charged for the use of sunbeds. We weren't allowed to go on the slides with our son in mini land and there weren't any slides that he was allowed to go on with us, even though many of the slides were quite tame. Aqualand needs to cater for this gap. Coral Reef in Bracknell in the UK is much better and cheaper!

The hotel is situated in a quiet location, more or less on a beach and across the road from a bus stop that has buses which serve most of the island's most frequented destinations.We were given a room on the top floor with a partial view of the sea. The room was spacious and very typically Mediterranean in its design with rustic terracotta floor, etc. Disappointingly, the room smelt of stale cigarettes as we walked in, but seemed to not be as strong in the sleeping area.The selection of toiletries in the bathroom were second to none, and I was delighted to find slippers and bathrobes for our use during our stay.The food selection at breakfast and the evening meals was excellent and the evening buffet varied slightly most evenings to give us a good choice.The pools were magnificent and very clean and not overcrowded either.The reasons for not rating the hotel as excellent were: 1.cleaners do not pay attention to detail, toilet roll holders were dusty and there were marks on the bathroom walls2. My husband was unable to sleep on the bed as he got a sore neck and back from the hard mattress.3.Often the fish was undercooked at the evening buffet4. On two occasions I drank from chipped glasses at breakfast time.5. Somehow drinks we did not have from the minibar were on our bill when we checked out, but this was resolved.I did speak to Lorena, one of the hotel managers and I must commend her on her excellent customer service, and professional approach too.

The staff were all very accommodating and friendly and the rooms were spacious and well kept. The toiletries given were basic (soap, shower gel and shampoo), and there are no iron or tea making facilities available in the rooms. Breakfast was good and there are other items available that can be given upon request at no extra charge.There is no pool until the summer months, and this should be made known on hotel booking sites as we were a bit disappointed about that.We ended up having to hire a car to get around as the walk to the station was too unpleasant. Italian dog owners should change their attitude and be more considerate to others and clean up after their dogs. Until we hired the car, I had to stay in the hotel in the evenings. Also there isn't much in the way of restaurants near the hotel. There also isn't much to see in Bari, but there are other beautiful areas in Puglia that can be explored. Oh, you can now take a train directly to the station opposite the hotel from the airport. (Quintella Sera, I think).
Sordnaxela|DE44459A99806E4FF719F7B8894E0A28|Hotel|Vilamoura: Dom Pedro Marina|2| “Great location, but hotel needs a major refurb.”|review_179031866|We chose this hotel based on the past reviews and the hotel's website so perhaps our expectations were too high. When we arrived at 10.30pm for check- in we had to wait 30 mins as another guest was making a complaint and when we got to the check-in desk the receptionist did not even apologise for our long wait. We had also requested a crib prior to arrival and when we got to the room there was no crib for our toddler to sleep in. We couldn't even put him to sleep with us in the 'double' bed as our bed was made up individually as two singles and pushed together! They ended up having to get the crib from one of their other hotels so we were finally able to put baby to sleep at midnight. Again, nothing by way of an apology or explanation was ever offered.As for the room, I am sure there are better two stars.The tired terracotta floor in the lobby (not to our taste) continues to the room and the beds are similar to what I had in my student days. There were very limited amenities in the room, no iron or tea making facilities. The bathroom had that damp smell associated with old, nylon shower curtains. Toiletries provided are soap, shampoo and shower gel, but I think that additional items may be provided upon request. The breakfast was good, not amazing. Perhaps the addition of an omelette or pancake chef would have made it better, and also more homemade cakes and desserts which are often found in Portuguese hotels at breakfast. Wifi worked in our room, but there is a charge and it is per device! (Absolute rip-off). How can any hotel in this day and age rightfully charge for the use of a wifi network, especially given that this charge amounts to €13 for 3 days? 10 wifi customers and the hotel's made a healthy profit! The other charge that disgusted us and completely put us off the hotel is that guests have to pay to use Dom Pedros sun loungers on the beach!! I've visited over 30 hotels close to the beach, and this is the first time that I have come across this one.We knew that the hotel and rooms would not look like the Dunas resorts (which are more modern and contemporary but poor location without a car), but we never expected the hotel's decor to be so drab.Most of the staff are quite sombre, apart from a few. We have to give a special mention to Luis, as Alexandra, he is your biggest asset, very friendly, helpful and jovial.Luckily for the hotel, we are not the archetypal Brit travellers who in general appear to be content with the hotel and its amenities so I guess the hotel does not need to modernise if the hotel is always busy.
Sordnaxela|DE44459A99806E4FF719F7B8894E0A28|Hotel|St. John's: Hawksbill by Rex Resorts|1| “Baring The Truth”|review_155748427|This resort does not appear to have seen any form of update or upgrade since its conception in the 1960s and is sadly dilapidated. Paintwork is either smeared with dirt or decay and proceeding to peel itself away; timber-work is progressing towards the end of its serviceable life; electrics are unsoundly antiquated and partial to emitting wild sparks when plugging something in or the reverse; floor tiles are uneven, subject to botched repairs and, as such, liable to hurt your poor, by now dirty, feet! The list could go on, but let it be said: The rooms, no matter the grade you allow yourself to pay for, are awful in every sense; dirty and degraded. I have had the fortune in this life to stay in circa two hundred hotels and this one is truly the worst. To think that we paid extra money to have a Superior Room is a painful reflection to me.Now, there is a subtext to the story of Hawksbill which some may know, regarding its lease status and associated legal wrangle, and a potential reason as to why it is that it has been permitted to slowly perish this way, but one would have hoped that the superficiality of these gripes could be assuaged by a friendly, welcoming and service-driven set of staff, but hopes were too high, it seems. The attitude of the vast majority of the female staff at this hotel was incredible. Allow me to quantify that adjective: Incredibly disgusting. I had thought that Antigua's survival balanced very delicately on its dependence on tourism. Well, these birds would have you believe that you had done something profoundly wrong to them, before you had even uttered a word. Smiles were in drought, spoken tones harsh, condescending and bitter and application of manners......lost. Never have I had the experience of being so mal-treated at a holiday resort. The attitude of these women, and I intentionally dis-include the make staff in this, who were always jovial and helpful, was a disgrace: brutish and pig-ignorant. Antiguan women at this hotel have attained the dizzying heights of World's Rudest on the strength of Hawksbill. Links supporting my claim are plentiful across the web.Escape, escape! Just try it. The hotel is located in absolute isolation, which sounds nice and secluded enough, but with taxi drivers being the one and only way of leaving site and, monopolistically charging tourists a small fortune for a 4 mile trip, visiting shops, bars, better restaurants, general activity or going on tours is very quickly stymied as a viable option. Examples of local services trying to gain unfairly from the tourist trade through rip-off prices were present at every turn, but nowhere were they as clear and ridiculous than with the taxis. Some said that being a private hire driver was one of the island's most sought after professions. They certainly have you where they want you, unless you can successfully pass yourself off as a local, whence you can expect to pay 3-4 times less. So, you are essentially a prisoner at the resort. In all fairness, it would be perfectly viable to stroll to the bus stop where prices are much more realistic, but I suspect a 1.5 mile hike up and down a few hills in the heat may be a deterrent.Unless you are part of the swinging 60s crowd, dubbed 'The Repeaters' by the staff, who seem to be responsible for having kept this place in business, then I would suggest avoiding this place as though it were a deathly plague. Far from there being five restaurants, as the brochures will lavishly imply, there are in fact a mere two; consisting of the principle and largest, serving breakfast and evening dinner, and the beachside area, serving lunch from the grill and afternoon tea.As for the beach, the sand is golden and not the white I was expecting and, let's say that, curiosity killed the cat when I decided to venture on to the clothing-optional beach. I did my best to avoid eye contact with the unclothed hotel guests; people with whom I had probably exchanged words with at dinner or around the resort, but I respected their decision to use that beach for its 'freedoms.' However, the inclusion of the physically-toned, nude, local twenty-something and his laissez-faire self-fondling in the bushes, did little to quash my former suspicion that this beach held some other charm and attraction than simply its naturist label.I could go on, but suffice to say that the brochures and the agents do not, in any way bearing semblance to truth, give you the reality to the story with Hawksbill. There are some positives, for sure; the cocktails are some of the best I have had; the grilled fish at lunch was delightful; the sea is especially good for swimming as it is comfortably shallow for a large distance out from the shore. But these factors are not enough to extol any further virtue about this resort. Frankly, it is a joke and, possibly, the biggest positive I can extract from the experience is that we do laugh about how shocking it was.

The food was your average anglicised curry and the quality of the meat was really poor (sinewy and thus chewy). The meat didn't taste as if it had been properly cooked in the curry sauce and there was little difference between the Balti and Madras. If you aren't familiar with good Indian cooking, you may well beg to differ with our low opinion of the restaurant.

Although portions are larger than Kayaloram, the food (apart from the mixed seafood curry) wasn't much different to what we would eat at a standard Bangladeshi. The aubergine cakes were very greasy and the Indian bread was quite hard. The waiters kept on getting our orders mixed up, we never received the salad we ordered and we were presented with a takeaway dish we never ordered.

Some of the dishes we have tried are the spinach lamb curry, chicken puffs, aubergine cakes, squid, marinated fish, salad and mutton curry. Depending on which waiter you get, service is very good. My only criticism is that the decor is a bit stark.

The food lacks any kind of spice, and all the sauces taste like they have a high sugar content. We requested a dish that was authentic and as the waiter would eat and he appeared very confused with that request. We were presented with something that was far from authentic (compared to Bangladeshi home cuisine). Also, although the restaurant is good value, they charge £1 per poppadom plus 80p for the chutneys.

The main purpose of the trip was to see the New Year fireworks and although it is slightly too far out to view the fireworks, the hotel do a trip to the centre costing 10 euros per person return. There were a few hotels on my list and the main reason I chose this hotel is because Rosana took the time to reply back to my emails whereas other hotels such as Alto Lido never came back to me. It wasn't a problem that the hotel was in different blocks as they were connected by an underground walkway if it was too cold to cross the road with our 8 month old baby. The other reasons for choosing the hotel were because it had an indoor pool, it was minutes away by foot to a large shopping mall, the floors in the room were wooden so easy to disinfect to allow baby to crawl, the airport bus and other buses stop right outside the hotel, Internet was free ( though very poor quality), it had a good breakfast buffet, they provided a baby bath as well as crib for the baby and on hotels.com ( where I normally book all my hotels), it was the best value for money. If I had to point out the negatives, they would be that the toiletries provided are extremely minimal, the hotel is just a little too far out from the centre to walk with a pushchair, the Internet connection though free, was very poor, although the rooms were well decorated in a contemporary style, the wetroom style bathroom really let it down as the black floor gave the impression that the bathroom was not as clean as it could be. A lighter coloured floor would have made all the difference. Also at breakfast, there was orange squash rather than fresh juice. Aside from these minor criticisms, I would recommend this hotel to others, especially to families. I would also agree with the other reviewers that the staff on the whole are all very friendly and helpful.

There were two restaurants side by side with almost identical tourist menus and we chose this one as there were other diners. At under 10 euros for the set menu, it was very well priced but the quality of the food was reflected in this. The nicoise salad came without olives and eggs and the vegetable soup was salty and lukewarm. The grilled sardines my husband ate were large enough to require gutting and a couple of them had the consistency of mush. My tuna steak was overcooked and tasted quite fishy. The best thing about the meal was the fried corn which makes a lovely change to having chips as an accompaniment. The food at Pingo Doce's restaurant in the Forum was much better than what we ate here plus the people working in the restaurant appeared quite miserable.

There was lots to choose from on the menu and we decided on the grilled prawns, and the grilled squid. Had I been a fan of all shellfish, then I would have chosen the mixed grilled seafood for approx 60 euros for two.The main meal was delicious, but was topped by the most amazing pudding I have ever tasted. It was called 'dulce tres leches' and was a very moist sweet sponge cake with cinnamon cream on top. I would go back to Madeira just to have this dessert again!

Antigua wasn't really for us as we are more city people, but it was a good experience nevertheless. We checked in before 3pm so our room wasn't ready and it took a couple of hours before it was. This is because the Maids do a really thorough job of cleaning the rooms so they are spotless.We booked the hotel through hotels.com and when booking were concerned about the location as we would have preferred to be more central. However, the hotel is only a few minutes walk from the centre and if we had stayed in the centre we are certain that our sleep quality would've been affected.We never got to use the Spa facilities as the Jacuzzi had broken down, but we did spend some time sunbathing. The hotel garden doesn't get any sun so you have to go to the first floor where most of the rooms are located anyway.

Lunch was a very generous portion and okay value. The portions in the evening are smaller but the food was always very tasty. If people complain about the price, I would say that it is comparable to other places in San Pedro and cheaper than Mambo lounge. Belize is fairly expensive for tourists, but when we ate at a restaurant local people ate in, the food was nowhere near as good. We didn't have any wine with our meal as had been advised by our travel agents that wine in Belize is very expensive for what you get. Oh, make sure you check the price of the specials as we didn't realise that they are more expensive than other dishes.

We went to Zurich to see how they celebrate the New Year and we wanted to be close to the lake to enjoy the fireworks and New Year celebrations. Helmhaus had the perfect spot as the food stalls, dj and fireworks over the lake were literally round the corner.We have to agree with the reviews that most of the reception staff were helpful, and a special mention must be given to Mario for his professionalism and high level of customer service.We liked that breakfast is included in the room rate (another reason for choosing the hotel) and thought that the scrambled eggs were cooked to perfection.The only negative point about the hotel is that our room was quite noisy (more noise from within the hotel than outside) and I would make a suggestion that the hotel asks its guests to wear the slippers provided as we could hear the guests above walking on the wooden floor.

We thought the hotel was charming in decor and did remind us of England- it even does afternoon tea! The only reason we booked this hotel was because it is very near to the airport and we thought we could save money on the taxi rather than going from the Radisson. We asked the hotel to call a taxi (big mistake) to the airport and in 5 mins we were there. Imagine our shock to be asked for 290 pesos when if the journey was on a meter it wouldn´t have come to 100 pesos. Yes we admit that we should have checked first but as it was a radio taxi we assumed that the meter was on. Please learn from our mistake, there are taxis round the corner from the hotel which we didn´t see that you can flag yourself so you are not paying the commission to the hotel.

I really enjoyed my stay at the Radisson. The pool is fantastic, breakfast has a good selection and they make omlettes to order at no extra cost. Didn{t like the decor of the rooms as a bit too traditional but hotel is ver clean. Also I left some clothes behind in the wardrobe and I went back to the hotel to pick them up a few days later.

Hotel rackrate is $160. Europa is your typical business class hotel. We were a little annoyed that the fitness centre was closed for refurbishment but the equipment in their was terrible anyway. I never got the bathrobe I requested but things could be worse. Breakfast selection was good, but the gourmet restaurant was far from gourmet.

At first glance the hotel looks fine, but when you look at the finer detail you will notice that everything in the hotel is done very cheaply. I found my room to be shabby and was disgusted to see both cockroaches and a mouse in our meeting room. The hotel didn't seem particularly bothered by either of these complaints.

I was expecting the kind of buffet which 4-5 star hotels provide but the dinner buffet was mostly made up of salads (one of which was still frozen). Hotel is about a 7 minute walk from Karlaplan station and we did get lost a couple of times.The rooms are very small and basic- not 4 star quality and I found a cockroach in the shower with me. I reported this to the hotel but they didn't really say anything.On the positive staff are friendly especially Marten, who ensured that my friend got her vegan meal at buffet time.

It appears that there is the local price and the Tourist Price. We ended up walking for 10 minutes to catch the local buses which ended up costing us £4 rather than £60 to see the Sulphur Springs at Soufriere. Also there appears to be a tourist and a local menu at the restaurant called the Shack in Marigot Bay. The hotel itself has very bad reception hours and they failed to tell us information such as breakfast was being served early on the day of the Cricket match so we ended up missing out on breakfast which we'd paid for. Also Bernie at the hotel who seemed pleasant told us that no public buses would be running on the day of the cricket so we'd have to pay $50 for the hotel shuttle. Of course we didn't take his advice and used public transport without much of a problem.Hotel and Doolittles Restaurant is a little dated and could do with some much needed modernisation. It is known as an 'Eco' resort I think this stands for Economical rather than Ecological.I've read the reviews on Discovery Bay which were all very good but I've spoken to some of the locals who have worked there who said that the wages were very bad. Also the hotel doesn't appear to allow it's staff to eat at the hotel which I think is quite appaulling. I found many people to be quite rude throughout the island. Unlike the other Carribean island where the locals often greet you, people here would just stare. .I didn't like St Lucia because of these points. Barbados and Grenada are much better holiday destinations. Grenada in particular is lovely and not marketed enough over here.

Rooms are extremely modern and the bathroom is very nice. However the hotel is very strangely located within a shopping mall (and not a very good one at that). There are no beach facilities such as chairs etc, and no pool. Breakfast in the morning was a below average buffet selection with lots of flies to accompany you.

The location is not great for public transport and getting around. However if this is not important to you then you may not be disappointed. Included in our rate was afternoon tea which comprised of a few measly sandwiches and marble cake, and breakfast prepared and served by our personal maid on our balcony. The breakfast menu choice was fairly limited, and we generally prefer large selection buffet breakfast . Again it depends what you prefer. I also stayed in South City Plaza and Coyaba in Grenada and I would rate the Coyaba beach resort way above the Calabash. Some other points are that the pool was tiny and the gym really does need updating at the Calabash.

FoodGreat selection of food for breakfast, dinner and tea, plus if you're hungry in between the snack bar offers burgers, hot dogs, biscuits, ice creams, etc... the food was amazing always something for everyone and they even have a kids corner. DrinksThe drinks on the all inclusive were great, the beer was not to our taste but there was plenty of other things to pick, during the day you can just serve yourself beer, wine, sangria, tea, coffee, coke etc.... at night the bar staff were always quick with the cocktails and they was never much of a qui, we mainly drank Irish cream (Barleys) on a night.LocationGreat location if you want to just stay at the hotel, as there is nothing much around.Just 5 minutes walk away there is a small beach that was nice, the water was very clear, however the beach did seem to smell a little, there is also a bar/restaurant at the beach but that's all.You can take a bus to "Meo" town centre, this is €1.70 TransferQuick transfer to the airport just 10 minutes On another note, if you're a smoker take cigarettes with you, the only place you can buy them from is the machine at the beach bar, plus there is no cash machines anywhere at all.

I had booked for 4pm and we were advised to get there for half 3, to be on the safe side I left at half 2 from the hotel. The staff told me they rang me at half 2 to inform me it was cancelled even though they themselves admitted they found out at 1pm. I was pretty mad they didn't seem to understand that they should've rung me straight away and didn't bother to reimburse for the cab fare. When I got to the hotel i checked the voicemail and it had been left well after half 2 :| not impressed

We had the best time ever, all the rides are so much fun. We got there about 15 minutes before the park opened and there wasn't much rush at the ticket counter (it was Monday) . We brought the single express ticket which means you can use the express line for each ride once (most of the rides do have an express line). The rides we enjoyed the most were the transformers, the mummy ride and the Steven Spielberg experience. Because of the express ticket and not many people we did the whole park by 13:00pm, we then sat and watched the mels dinettes performance which was great too!! There are many dining options inside and outside the park, if you choose to dine outside the park attendants stamp your hand so you can come out and then go back in.

There are your less pricier brands either in the malls itself or further down orchard road. Food is also easily accessible in the 55 malls that the road has (okay not 55 but there was at least 6-7 malls all side by side). Halal food was a bit of a struggle as only few places have a certificate. However a local told us all chicken/beef is halal but if the restaurant serves alcohol or pork the government does not issue a certificate but rest assured you won't starve..... unless it's after 10:30 because pretty much everything is closed after this time!

It's pretty but me and my husband don't have a particular interest in flora and fauna so if had found something else to do we could've have easily missed it off the itinerary. The waterfall is lovely as is the whole layout of the cloud forest, be sure to take a cardigan or shawl as it is a little cold.

I wouldn't say it was the highlight of our trip but as we had time we didn't mind. There's a lovely waterfall and plenty of flora and fauna. There is also a little interactive feature on climate change. We also went to the light show at the super tree grove, this was fun. Everyone just either sat or lay on the floor and watched the show. It's not as spectacular as say the musical fountains in Dubai but it's still beautiful.

Well what a waste of time and money! First there is no form of organisation. We brought the 8:15 show tickets and it was 7:00 and all we saw was people racing for the entrance and huge line formed...basically no one tells you that you should also be in the line....also everyone just pushes in...no sorry, excuse me or thank you so be prepared! Then you have this awkward fire show whilst you are still in the queue???? I mean they were god but so random! After which the gates open and there's practically a stampede to get to the creatures of the night show........now this is the only bit where you see a few nocturnal animals . The rest of the safari you drive around and see animals that can be seen in any safari to be honest. Basically don't waste you're money here!

Very organised, there was a video on loop showing how the tower was constructed which was really amazing and the guides explained everything. We were given ample time in each area to look around and take pictures and the views were lovely. I think it's one of those places you just have to visit once and you don't need more than 15-20mins to soak up the experience.

The place looks run down, the inside of the lift looks like a war took place in it and the actual observation deck..... A disappointment. The views yes are good but the market style stalls all around the deck brings the experience down, like another reviewer said you just see the reflection of these shops in the window. Maybe if these stalls were on another floor it would be better. There was no service like you have at other towers (petronas or burj khalifa), no guide to talk about the tower ,everyone just seemed uninterested and wanted to quickly get you through the photo op! We also went to the restaurant and again the service was slow, buffet was below average (our hotels would beat them hands down) and the actual dinner was overpriced! I would say no need to part with your money on this tired place.
Shabana S|782998D5E1D36246E1D716B1CA024285|Hotel|Kuala Lumpur: The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur|3| “Great but some areas not so much”|review_324878608|Wonderful hotel away from the hustle bustle of KL. Has regular shuttle services to popular areas so getting round is not such a problem. The buffet (breakfast,lunch and dinner) is fantastic, it's not the downgraded cheap buffet style you normally get. There is everything from pizza, to dim sum to Tom yum noodle soup, the waiters are very attentive and try to fulfil every need. The dessert selection at the buffet is to die for, so just remember not to fill yourself up too much on mains! The whole hotel has a colonial style and each room is a treat. We were upgraded to the junior suite and it did not dissapoint, the room was a good size and the beds were way too comfy.However there are some areas where improvements can be made.1) the chefs manning the buffets need to be more attentive to the guests when they come to their stations especially if there is live cooking involved as sometimes I found myself waiting for ages while they were talking amongst themselves.2) the TV is not that great in the bathroom when trying to watch from the tub, the picture has a line going through it and causes discolouration.3) if your someone who likes to relax in or by the pool then you will be disappointed here. The pool looks like they dug a hole in the gravel and threw some water in, I think this is an area they really need to improve asap.4) the spa......the staff at the spa seemed really uninterested, the treatments were highly priced and we were told as guests we can use their facilities for free with a treatment.......the "facilities" was actually another pool dug up in the gravel near the main road/drive of the hotel. There was nothing relaxing about this place.Overall I would go back for the service of the hotel and the rooms.

After travelling for 24 hours to get to e&o hotel this was our second delight (after the hotel itself). Ying the receptionist was very welcoming and sat with us to find out what what Areas we wanted to concentrate on etc. we went for the cerita dongeng (couples package), this was 3 hours of pure bliss to the point our masseuse's novi and cyndley put me and my husband to sleep ...snoring and all! Within the 3 hours we had 3-4 different styles of treatment which was well worth the money. Both masseuses were experienced and professional from start to the end, also the decor and rooms have a very soothing ambience? We loved it so much that we went back again for the same treatment before we left except this time I had the hot stone massage and my husband had the hot compression one. Make sure you make at least one visit to this place it's well worth it!

We stayed in the superior suite with a sea view room, it was absolutely stunning. The decor all around the hotel is very vintage and every detail down to the music is in keeping with this. The hotel has a butler service who took very good care of us, didn't matter whether request was big or small but they managed to fulfil it. We mainly dined at planters lounge As it was less busy better service and the view better. If luxury is what you are looking for this is the place.

The lemonade mint drink was so truly refreshing I had to have two! To wind down after food they also have shisha in variety of flavours too. Would definitely visit here again when in KL.

Whether staying a couple of days or a couple of months this place is fantastic. The beach access is 75 metres from the front door and a bitumen footpath or cycleway that will take you to Emu Point where there is a lovely cafe & the famous Kalgan Queen river Boat which we highly recommend.The middle queen bed room is the quieter of the two queen rooms and also not affected by the morning sun. The beds were comfortable and the showers hot. For the golf lovers the closest course is next door :-) The internet / phone signals are pretty poor so enjoy the lack of technology and interruption.

Credit has to go to all the wonderful people who have donated the contents of the cottage. It is a wonderful collection and we thoroughly enjoyed it and our lovely chat with the elderly gent who was holding the door. If you have well behaved children it is a nice way to introduce them to the past but there is not a lot of room for those children who might have a little too much energy.

We were then introduced to some other Pelicans, Sea Eagles, Osprey's and a school of hungry fish. Jack's knowledge of the wildlife along with his story telling was very entertaining for both the kids (10yrs) and adults. We did the afternoon cruise and filled the morning with a trip to two peoples bay.

We chose the Atrium because the kids are more likely to find something they will eat rather than a swanky restaurant like Rockpool or Norbu or a pub. The cost is right up there but you can not argue that the quality is very high and the choices are fantastic. I find it a bit hard to cope with though that you have to pay extra for soft drink and basic tea / coffee when already paying $75 a head.

This made sleep very very disruptive right through the night which is not great with kids and makes for a grumpy mum the next day! At around $500 a night for a base room it was very disappointing. I will definitely be asking for a much higher floor next time and as far from the back door of the hotel :-)Staff service is impeccable and could not be faulted. The place is pricey for food, drinks, parking and sleeping so be prepared. It cost $25 to park overnight in the underground carpark; free parking is available but not next to the hotel. It cost $8 for 1ltr of milk so bring your own! The pool area is beautiful so if you have the chance stay during our long hot summer.

It is an 800 metre walk along a track with plenty of tripping hazards and coming back is just as bad but it's all uphill! Scenery is great but you can certainly see how people have been swept away from this spot. You have to get a bit too close to the edge (blowholes) for my liking but I enjoyed watching the local surfers around the corner in a little bay below.

The kids will love being able to climb on the old war guns etc. Beautiful views all along the various walks of the Fortress out over the sound too so really allow time to soak it all in. If doing the National ANZAC Centre also, with kids I strongly recommend you let them explore the Fortress first and burn off some energy as the Centre is quite solemn and there is a lot to listen to and read etc. We spent four hours here.

It is confronting but so very well done. Absolute credit to all involved. The cost could be off putting to some but please don't be scared off, you will not regret it. It was $24 for adults and $10 for kids (2nd and subsequent kids $5). It is not a place for kids to run around etc, it is a solemn place and should be respected. There is a lot of information to absorb and listen to so allow a good 1.5 hours to go through it.

If you have more than one car and staying in the back two Villa's parking can be a bit tricky at peak times but nothing you cant solve by parking out on the road. Noise was not an issue at all.

It seems Perth only does late night pub venues but not late night coffee shops which meant it was very popular leading to a 20 minute wait for a table. We were a party of 7 (one child) but only 6 chairs so the manager very kindly gave our son the chair from his office.We ordered 3 Dessert Degustations, coffees & Tea. They were extremely busy so the wait was a little longer than what one would could consider normal but it was worth it. The Desserts were beautifully presented and very tasty. We will definitely visit again.

The dining room was quite noisy with a few tables of 6+ so could only imagine how noisy it would be if full. Could not fault the service though, orders had to be placed and paid for at the bar.

We were a table of six with two having the bucket of seafood, one having the linguine, one the braised lamb shoulder and two the beef fillet. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals but if there was one negative it was the beef fillet could have done with a bit of salad or vegetable on the plate.Desert of the day was a Crepe Suzette prepared at the table or a chocolate lava cake. We ordered both plus a Tiramisu and WOW were they good. Could not fault any of them. I had the Lava cake and it was to die for.....completely blowing the weight watchers points to smithereens.Service was immaculate, all the staff had a sense of humour and great knowledge of what they were serving and not at all intrusive. OH and they do take-away! We live 50km's away so not practical for us sadly but if you live nearby go fo it!!!! Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights they do a $15 special which seemed great value for the standard of food and we watched many tables order the seafood platter for two so obviously word get's around.

Our kids are aged 3 and 8 and they loved the resort. The suite room comes with a big bedroom (two king size beds), big bathroom, dressing area, living room and kitchen. It is spacious and lovely. Suites are a bit far away from the rest of the hotel and you enjoy a bit of privacy. There is a special swimming pool for those that stay in the suite however kids under 12 are not allowed. You can also enjoy complimentary wifi, breakfast in another restaurant and an afternoon tea. Sea is not good and there are lots of people doing water sports and because of this there is non stop gasoline smell on the beach. Beach is not Private so many locals approaching you for affordable massage or water sports. Jiwa spa is one of the best, highly recommended. Dinner and breakfast at Suku restaurant is average however the RIN restaurant is one of the best Japanese restaurants I have ever been. I also highly recommend that you rent a sun lounger in the azure, it comes with a lunch which is very easy for families. Since the beach is not nice, they converted two of the pools into a sand pool and it is great for young kids. Lastly, the private dinner at the beach is the best ever, you should definitely try it.

Sea is beautiful, lovely to swim in the morning, we didn't want to leave it. However in the afternoon, it becomes muddy. It has two restaurants, Terrace and Planters both are fantastic but the service is too slow. For a three course lunch, you need to spend 1.5-2hrs in the restaurant. You have breakfast in Planters and lots of flies on cheese and fruits. And there are not many western options in breakfast. Spa is very good, I would highly recommend it. Kids club is OK but there is noone that stays and takes care of the club regularly. No activities. Overall we had a very pleasant stay but it feels like an adult hotel rather than a family one.

The rooms are very comfortable although a bit old. The resort is a compact one, breakfast is super with lots of choices. We stayed full board but you need to know that they give you a different set menu if you are full board. It is still Ok but not nice. We tried the Italian and Thai restaurants as well as two nights open buffet, it was good. The dance shows in the open buffet restaurant is nice. For lunch they need to have open buffet alternative other than the one in the beach, it is only noodle. Kids club is quite good but not many activities. Beach is good, sea is very wavy so kids do not enjoy. Pool is quite big and all restaurants are around it so you always have a nice view. Service was lower than expectations that is why I didnt give a five star!

What I liked about it is that the beach is very big, it has a beach club in case you want to eat something or rent sunbeds (which we did't) and there is available space for everyone. It never gets crowded. Sand is white and beautiful. There are green grass areas which you can again sit down and relax. What I didn't like is that there are many people with dogs and all dogs are swimming and you need to swim next to them. The sea is ocean so so not expect crystal clear water.

It has a big pool which you can enjoy with your family. Open buffet breakfast and Lunch are good. We had dinner in the Arabian and Italian restaurants. Arabian is a bit far away, the atmosphere is very nice, you truly feel that you are in the middle of the desert. Italian is also ok, food was not excellent. We waited for 20 min for the boogy car to come and pick us up from the Arabian restaurant, so be prepared. Upon check in, the amount that I booked in booking.com and the actual were different. Sunset at the rooftop bar is lovely, just be aware that everyone is smoking. Spa is good. Overall, I would recommend the hotel.

We bought already 3 tickets to be able to climb up the trees unfortunately they did not accept us cause the last schedule of acceptance was 8:30pm. If only we were informed, we could have go up earlier as we were in the vicinity at 6pm but since we want to watch the light show, we did not right away go up. Our tickets were wasted. This did not bother us from getting pissed cause we were happy people roaming around singapore. For me, there is no need to buy the tickets.

Staff is always ready to attend our needs, like we need an adaptor to charge our phones, they immediately send someone to give it to us. Though, it is quite far from the MRT station, taxis are always available. It is also near Marina Bay and Sentosa. The bellboys were very helpful like when we went outside and it was about to rain, they immediately give us an umbrella that we can return to the hotel after using. There is a swimming pool at the 5th floor but we didn't have time to use it. There is also a restaurant near the lobby where there is a band playing at night. I surely would recommend this hotel. And if ever we will be going back to Singapore, we will surely take this hotel.

The Hotel has a unique design, room was small but it was tidy and neat. The only thing that bothered me was that the rooms were not sound proof, you can hear the voices of people talking in the other room. If you want to turn off the air conditioner and get some fresh air, you can do that by opening the door leading to a small balcony where you can view the chinatown. We only stayed there for one day, but it was worth it. The lady receptionist gave us excellent service. First, she gave us directions on where we want to go. Second, she was kind enough to have our bags deposited when we check out since our flight is still 12 midnight. The good feature of this hotel is that they provide a cellphone which has a wifi, they also have unlimited drinks and snacks that you can get in the lobby. It is also near the buddha relic temple, where you can take some pictures.

Too bad, an arrogant security approached us and inquired what we were doing there? I felt embarrassed as there were other guest at that time looking at us. I told him that we were checked in the hotel and showed him our room card. It was only when he saw it that he apologised. We have been to a lot of resorts already but this is the first time that a security personnel did that to us. I didn't give him the chance to get into my nerves. I was with my family and we were there spending quality time together. However at 4am, my son woke us up because he was vomiting and had been in the CR several times. We called front desk to see if there is a doctor or nurse available to see my son. They replied that there was none. We were told to go to the hospital which was around 20 minutes from the area. We ask if they can assist us with the transportation since it was still very early. Thank goodness they did but with a price! I hope you serve your client with a heart. that's all!

It is a 3-4 min walk from Barbican station (direct Metro line to Wembley - purple).Staff were very welcoming when we arrived and were able to hold our luggage due to our early arrival, upon our formal check in in the evening we found our room to be very spacious excellently decorated and with sky sports TV.Our only disappointment was the breakfast was extra (ended up going to a hipster bike / cafe shop round the corner).One of the comfiest sleeps I have ever had in a hotel was here and the bathroom had an intriguing blind / window between the bathroom and bedroom areas.

Inside the stadium offers a surprisingly tasty variety of food and of course alcohol. Compared to other stadiums its not overly expensive, with perfect views from any seat.

When we went the construction was still underway and there were a little too many monkeys. I think other tourists were feeding them too much but I don't know how that can be avoided.

The night life was a bit too intense there, lots of ping pong shows, eel shows, frog shows and I don't know what else.The vendors are fairly persistent even with my droll Scottish demeanor, probably suited for younger folk who want to get stupidly drunk.

I was so wrong to be the class was amazing. You learn about different foods and prepare your own food to share, all fresh and great tasting.The staff on hand were 10/10 for knowledge, skill and comedy, they had us laughing with the "root root root toot toot toot, exercise and dancing" song!When we attended we were one of two groups, we all had a common area and a separate group cooking area where we made each dish.We kept the books and have been inspired since cooking at homeMany Thanks Pum Team

I am so thankful he knew where to go, Joe's downstairs was excellent.The food was really nice offering a great range of cuisine and styles, a really good fusion of all foods can be had.The location offered excellent sea views and a nice sea breeze and the restaurant was delightfully decorated.Could not fault the place and would recommend anyone to go there.

Staying as a large group / family September 2016 we had three rooms over the higher levels of the resort. The commanding view over the beach was unreal, the rooms super spacious and the service top class. Breakfast was great every morning around the poolside, the bar and other food was also excellent, the swim up bar being a particular favourite.Every staff member was so welcoming and very polite I can't express how perfect this place was!To top it off the animals (tortoise / rabbits and an elephant) were such a great addition!
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Botanic Gardens|4| “So big.....”|review_493236730|We visited the gardens last September and we did not cover much ground through the heat. Overall the gardens is a fantastic place to visit there is so much variety of plants and exhibits to see, it is a very serene place. There was a band playing some smooth songs whilst we walked around the pond, a perfect way to spend in the afternoon of the bustling city.
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Attractions|Singapore: F1 - Singapore Grand Prix|5| “Arguably the best F1 track to visit”|review_476760312|We attended the 2016 Singapore Grand Prix and out of all the other tracks I have visited, Singapore is arguably one of the best overall. It is not by any means the cheapest and due to the track being a street circuit there isn't one place that offers brilliant views. But what it lacks in pricing and views it more than makes up for in atmosphere, organisation and off-track activities.We were at the Bay grand stand which is the cheapest grandstand overlooking the corner before the cars drive underneath the stand. This offers limited view of the cars but a great backdrop of the Marina Bay. We also got access to the free music events each night which included Bastille, Imagine Dragons and Queen.It really appealed to those in the party who were less interested in the grand prix. Everyone is really friendly and informative and being in the city there is plenty of choices for food and drink. With easy access to the MRT system is makes it very easy to get away from the track after.The Padang stage area was a great place to rest and catch some music and really just soak up the weekend, highly recommend visiting this part of the track if you are going for the F1.
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Flyer|5| “Great one-off Experience”|review_476755156|We visited the Singapore Flyer during the 2016 Grand Prix. We were very lucky as we had pre-booked on the only available day we could (Thursday) as it is not available to the average joe on the Fri-Sun at night.We booked the Singapore Sling cocktail booth which overall we felt provided better value for money, you sign in downstairs then are brought up in a lift to the cocktail lounge before boarding. The view was brilliant and the cocktail was actually really good (much better sling than at Raffles). The whole rotation took about half an hour but it was nice at night to see the city shining and the race track outline.Worth noting that if you attend during the Grand Prix it can be a little tricky to walk to the Flyer, give yourself plenty time!
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Restaurant|Singapore: The Refinery Restaurant & Bar|4| “Hidden Local Gem”|review_476753312|I visited The Refinery in September 2016 during a visit of Singapore, it was a short walk from our hotel (Hotel Boss) and provided a different local place for brunch. I visited with my partner, my cousin and her boyfriend and all of us were very happy with the food, service and setting. I ordered the waffle with bacon and ice cream and some sides of hash browns, which was all very tasty. I didn't think the place was any more expensive than anywhere else and we really liked the more local feel to the place in comparison to some other touristy areas.We found photos on Pinterest and were very glad we visited.
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|3| “Good and average”|review_460337837|During our holiday to Singapore in September 2016 we made a visit to the Universal Studios on Sentosa Island.To get there we took the MRT to the Harbour front, walked through the mall and collected our tickets before boarding the express monorail to Sentosa. The theme park itself felt a little smaller than other theme parks we had visited, including Universal in Orlando but the place is very well laid out.The queues were a little long and we did take the fast pass options, some of the rides were great the Battlestar Galactica, Jurassic Park and Mummy rides were particularly fun. We didn't eat a meal at the park as we thought it was a little pricey. Overall this is a good place to visit but with restricted park size it doesn't quite live up to the Orlando sister parks.
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Attractions|Singapore: Gardens by the Bay|5| “So Good to visit Day and Night”|review_449890562|during a Grand Prix Holiday to Singapore we visited the Gardens by the Bay during the day and night.During the day we took the Bayfront Downtime MRT line and a walkway which went under sheares Avenue and took us to the front of the gardens from there we walked around and took lots of photos of the lush surroundings. We also visited the two domes during the day which is highly recommended purely for the heat relief alone!We also walked to the Satay by the Bay for a bite to eat before heading back.During the night we walked through the Marina Bay Sands Mall and Marina Bay Sands to get to the Gardens (This was a badly signposted route and difficult to understand) The night visit coincided with the Chinese Lantern Festival which was a great visual treat at night, many guests had lanterns as well as the gardens themselves being lit. This also included different lit sculptures and characters who were also lit up. It was amazing to witness and we were so glad we visited twice.Overall I would recommend visiting the gardens during both times it is an incredible place to visit.

On top of that though it was a great way to cool down on a particularly hot day!It wasn't expensive and it didn't take too long to walk right round, there are plenty of photos available that explain it better than I can describe!
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Attractions|Singapore: Chinatown|4| “Chinatown Singapore”|review_449886338|On a recent holiday to Singapore with my partner and family we spent our first day visiting Chinatown. The area is very very easy to get to by the Metro line (by following signs for "Chinatown". Upon exiting the station and up to ground level we walked through Pagoda St which was beautifully coloured and decorated with hanging lanterns. We visited a few shops which sold a mixture of authentic items as well as some other "tat" but all the shopkeepers we spoke to were very pleasant and polite. We only bought small items token keyrings, fans and some small bites.We visited the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple which was a small 5 minute walk from the station entrance. the building itself is a sigh to behold and inside the whole place is lined with so much colour. It was interesting from being a non-religious person to take in the different cultures and beliefs.After our temple visit we walked around a few more stores and took a lot of extra photos, which took up a few hours in the morning. I would recommend anyone who hasn't visited here to visit.
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Restaurant|Singapore: LeVeL 33|5| “Beer, Views, Food and More Beers”|review_444426630|I pre-booked a balcony table during a recent holiday to Singapore at Level 33. To do this there was a minimum table spend in accordance with being the "F1 Weekend" but we were happy with this as we knew our spend would be greater.On our arrival in Singapore this was our first stop and it was a great experience, Level 33 is a brewery located within Marina Bay Financial Center - easily located by taking the Downtown Subway stop.Our table waiter had some good banter, what a lad, unfortunately I can't remember his name but he was taking pictures for us (cheeky) and made sure we all had plenty drinks.Myself and my cousins partner were smashing through the Beer paddles which allowed us to sample each of Level 33's beer choices, 3/5 were excellent the darkest one was ok and one of them was terrible ( I think that was the wheat beer). So we had more of the good stuff the IPA.The food choices were more of a share type and not really main meals but that suited us well as we were more out for a drink or 5. We ordered steak, tacos some fishy stuff and some olives and chorizo. The steak was absolutely smashing highly recommended................and the views - unreal, overlooking the harbour we got to see the sunset and the F1 lights come on and the city really come to life.Overall really worth visiting
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Hotel|Singapore: Hotel Boss|4| “A No Brainer”|review_444421036|Stayed at the Hotel Boss during the F1 weekend (14th-19th September 2016) this was based on other reviews, location and price. We were pleasantly surprised with how great this hotel was, for starters the hotel is very clean and the staff at the front desk are very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and modern and included free wifi, hairdryer etc. I can't remember our floor number but we had a great view over the city below.Breakfast was included and initially we went to the wrong food hall which was more for local food goers which was up one level near the pool. On the ground floor was our own breakfast hall which was a buffet style offering a selection of hot and cold food and drink. There was a good choice of food and enough variety for the time we were spending in the city. Our last breakfast we ate at a nearby brekkie bar (The Refinery) worth checking this place out in my other reviews! The pool area was large open and a great place to chill out, we usually grabbed a few beers and paddled about in the water for a good bit. Below and around the hotel were various shops and other small food outlets which were also very handy. The hotel is near the Lavender subway stop but we also had a wander to Bugis which is only a little longer.A great hotel which made a great holiday in Singapore
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Hotel|Aboyne: Aboyne Loch Caravan Park|4| “Great Camping Location”|review_444418746|I camped here in August 2016 with a group of friends for a long weekend, we reserved three pitches for three couples over the phone before our Friday afternoon arrival. Upon entering the site front desk office and paying for our pitch (which was really cheap!) we were shown to our pitch location which was near the loch edge. The pitch provided ample room for parking and for our tents, the gentleman who ran the place also pointed out to us the shower blocks and the fire pit / shelter area and left us to it. He did come back later once our tents were up to make sure we were settled in. In addition to pitches there is also chalet choices too but we were keen on some plain camping. The site itself is easy to navigate and the shower blocks were clean and free to use. On our second day we asked to rent a boat for going out on to the loch which the owner gladly helped with organising a time and boat for us and only charged a nominal sum of money. We got to row out onto the loch for a very long time and soak up the small amount of sun that was out.Overall this is a great place to spend a night camping
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Hotel|Banchory: Banchory Lodge|4| “Wedding Guest Review”|review_442832735|I stayed with my partner at the Banchory Lodge as part of our friends wedding in June 2016. We were fortunate to be part of the wedding party and so got to stay in the cottage behind the hotel.Our stay passed very quickly from our arrival friday night to leaving on the Sunday which included some lovely meals, a lot of alcohol and the joy of witnessing our friends wedding.On the first night I got a cottage basement room which looked over a small private garden over the river which was a very comfy and spacious room, the whole cottage we were in was excellent and spacious enough for all the wedding activities, it is also at the rear of the property to provide easy access to the function suite.The meals we had for both the wedding night and our arrival night were excellent and could not be faulted. This was also true of the breakfast which included a cooked meal and a cold buffet selection.The grounds of Banchory lodge provide some great backdrops to capture many photos and although not perfect weather, it was great to walk around. The layout between the bars and the function suite did mean that the wedding party was a little divided but it also provided intrigue for guests to wonder around.My favourite part was the outdoor decking which on the warm Friday evening provided a great social spot to unwind and enjoy a few drinks (photos attached).

It has a lavish beer garden.....and a great selection of very affordable drink (I recall Tuborg always being on special here).The last visit I made was in May 2016 during a mates stag doo, one of the newer delights we discovered were fishbowl cocktails at rock bottom prices, an excellent way to start any night.
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Restaurant|Glasgow: The Vintage|3| “Decent Place for Stag Doo Dinner”|review_442829466|I was part of a stag party in Glasgow and for our first night we made our way to the Drygate "The Vintage" for dinner. We had reserved a table for 10 people on the day of us visiting which was very accommodating as the best man was supposed to have this organised in advance!The girl who served us did a great job considering we were all half cut and excitable, probably the loudest there at the time. She earned a very good tip at the end of our visit so maybe it all worked out in the end. (She is the one in the photo, so thank you to looking after us all)The beer choices here were excellent and atmosphere of the place was quite cool too. I think everyone went for simple burger choices some meat some meat free, the consensus at the end of the night was that the meat free burgers were the better choice.I honestly can't remember how much it was but I don't remember anyone complaining so it was reasonable, I wish I could have described a lot more about the place but as previously noted we were quite intoxicated.
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Restaurant|Aberdeen: The Tippling House|4| “Cousin's birthday”|review_442827517|We visited the Tippling House in Aberdeen for my cousin's Birthday in April. The bar / restaurant is a great place to visit with a really nice and friendly atmosphere. Having never been before I didn't know what to expect, I thought as a bar the food might not be too good but I was very wrong.The food is brilliant, I recall having a beef dish with veg and it was very well presented and very tasty. Our server was really nice and was able to point out favourites on the menu as well as making sure we were always in good stock of drinks!Everyone in our party enjoyed themselves at the Tippling House and would all go back again!

Was very lucky through the week as it was quiet and a sunny day, great conditions for hitting the slopes.This was the first time my partner and I got to use the new 3-man chairlift to reach the top of the Cairnwell hill (just left of the hire shop). This gave access to the race track area and bunny run which was great to have a good snowboard down.Glenshee is great value for anyone looking to try snowboarding or skiing and with this new chairlift, lots of access to different areas for those not confident on pomas.I would strongly recommend going up mid week as it is a lot quieter, we also stayed at Blair that although close, it is the closest area of civilisation.

After previously visiting Hampden for football I can honestly say that the rugby is a much better day out.The sport and stadium allow mixed crowds with plenty of drink and entertainment before the kick off which creates quite the occasion. The stadium itself is a little old but with no running track around the perimeter each seat has a great view of the action.The game was great and Scotland had a great victory that day but everyone who attended was happy to watch a good game, exiting the arena is fairly quick, we wlaked along the road which is 15/20mins to Haymarket, there is a tram stop but it seemed a little too busy to use.I will be back again soon for the test matches, can't wait!

I had a sweet pork with a egg fried rice and could not fault any of it.From the outside the restaurant would be easy to pass due to its size but I would strongly encourage anyone to visit this place. I know I will be again next month!

This place is literally massive, you think you have learnt all you can and then a short hop over the railway line into another building and there is so much more exhibits. You could spend over a day to really see everything here and we had to miss a lot of it out due to time constraints.There is so much for kids to see and do too and us being big kids loved playing all the small games too.This is a great place to learn about science as well as appreciating how important Manchester was / is to various industries.

Unfortunately I cannot remember the very kind gentleman who provided the class (He is in all my photos) but he was a true hero very helpful, great sense of humor too.The cocktail class was a good length of time and everyone got to make their own cocktail as well as sampling many other drinks and then a final boys vs girls cocktail. Afterwards we were seated downstairs for a meal and more drinks which was also excellent.The Revolution bar at Deansgate is excellently decorated and has a great selection of food and drink, we would recommend it to anyone looking for a cocktail or 3!

This was our first visit to any steakhouse in Texas and we were very happy with the Keg. The services is excellent to start with and our assigned waiter ensured we had all the drink and food we could ask for. My own meal was the top sirloin which was cooked to perfection and was probably the best steak I have eaten in a long time.

As a UK resident I have never came across such a diverse and wide range of food and drink. As well as a shop there is a also a large buffet selection of food to help yourself to. We stopped for some light food and drink options and spent so long as there were so many tasty options.I was particularly impressed with the selection of chilled beers too!

The circuit itself is a modern style and is a great layout which always bring excitement. With the Grand Prix this was no exception as a little bit of rain ensured an exciting and dramatic conclusion to the 2015 Championship with Lewis Hamilton taking victory to secure his 3rd championship.We were very lucky to witness this race from our turn 15 grandstand seats albeit we got very wet! As much as the rain provided excitement to the race on the weekend as a whole we missed out on qualifying on the Saturday and were thoroughly soaked on race day. The information from the track on the Saturday was a bit disappointing and a decision should have been made earlier to cancel the qualifying until the next day. This did happen but we had wasted time to travel there, park wait a few hours to hear what was happening then leave again.Overall - Circuit 5/5Facilities 4/5Organisation 2/5Location 2/5

Being Scottish and not really knowledgeable on American history I found I learnt so much from the museum such as the events of the civil war, The great war, Battle of the Alamo etc.What I found the most surprising about the whole visit is where the timeline for Texas really begins which was around 1820, coming from Scotland we have a rich history dating back to as early as 80-85 AD with the Romans attacking the Caledonians. I was just taking aback by the depth of history. However this made me appreciate how America and Texas have grown so fast and so quickly to become the important state and country that they are today.Entrance fee wasn't expensive and there is underground parking, we were staying at a hotel near-by but if you make a short visit to Austin be sure to pop in.

We did a stadium tour and got to see the stadium from different seating positions, on the pitch, backroom and the VIP boxes. This stadium has set the bar for facilities so large and impressive with the super large HD screen lighting up the whole arena and the retractable roof making the venue very unique.They say everything is bigger in Texas and this stadium is true to that, yee-haa

It is mainly a bonnie place to take photos, it is really quiet and romantic and worth a sit down to take it all in.The place can get quite busy so trying to get those perfect shots is hard with everyone bobbing about.
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Attractions|Glenfinnan: Glenfinnan Viaduct|3| “It is what it is....”|review_376997321|During a visit on the west coast of Scotland last year, my partner and I had a visit to Glenfinnan. At this area there is a visitor centre, the viaduct and the monument overlooking the Glen. Couldn't justify paying for the train trip so proceeded to take a few snaps when the train came over, which in fairness looked better than actually being on the train.You can get near the viaduct via a farm track which was ok when it was dry. It is a beautiful setting for what it is but you don't need to spend too long here.Seen a couple of mental Harry Potter fans, tshirts, wands etc. Pure daftness!

I honestly can't remember what I ate (a guess at macaroni) but I remember it was a brilliant clean efficient place which I have mentioned to people when talking about Loch Lomond.Basically, it's fantastic

The centre itself is very well kept and full of so much things to learn as well as a lot of birds to view, particularly the owls, where I seen one of the biggest ever.The staff here were knowledgeable and very courteous, a delight to visit and if I am ever that way again I will be back.
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Hotel|Glasgow: citizenM Glasgow|5| “No.1 hotel choice in Glasgow”|review_376993083|Last August (2015) my partner and I went on a small tour of Glasgow and the west coast of Scotland, our 1st stop was a night in the CitizenM hotel.We booked direct on the website which gave us a discount and included a free cocktail and breakfast for our stay. The hotel itself is easy to find with ample car parking near by (they give you a reduced ticket so ignore the car park prices).On arrival the staff were very nice and helped us check in on the tablets they had set up. We got our keys and a voucher for cocktails in there fancy / arty area upstairs.The rooms themselves are small but the tablet in the room is cool as it controls lighting / TV / blinds / music it has a pod like atmosphere and European taste in films......The cocktails at the bar were brilliant and again we were met with a very welcoming staff member, this was the same place we had breakfast which was a large open help yourself buffet style but also included cooked food too.I couldn't ask for any more from a hotel.

Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Restaurant|Montreal: The Mon Cafe|4| “Fantastic Brunch / Lunch visit”|review_376990558|My partner and I were in Montreal last year for the Grand Prix and during our stay whilst wandering the streets we came across the Mon Cafe which is a boutique cafe that serves all types of meals.In all honesty we had this place mapped out before we got there as we seen photos posted on Instagram from the women wrestlers, Brie and Nikki Bella (very sad, I know!)Based on this we knew it would be a hit and it was, amazing coffee, and a croque monsieur! The man serving us was very nice and chatty and once we told him about why we actually came there he was quite surprised.Really worth a visit if you are hungry in Montreal.
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Attractions|Montreal: Formula 1 Grand Prix du Canada|5| “Arguably the greatest F1 event”|review_376988848|My partner and I attended the 2015 Canadian Grand Prix which we planned a city hop holiday around. As a passionate fan of F1 I thought visiting Montreal would be a great experience, and I was not disappointed.Access to the track is very simple via the subway system, from there it is a short walk to the track entrance gates. We had reserved seats in the Turn 1,2,3 area which was quite a walk but as we were spoiled with nice hot weather it was enjoyable. For being a long narrow island there was plenty of facilities, food stalls and merchandise stalls, obviously a lot quieter on qualifying day compared to the race day itself.Nothing was too expensive with all meals and drinks being very average priced, this could be due to the strong £/CAD exchange.The race itself wasn't too special (Mercedes 1,2) but to walk on the track and wait outside for half an hour we got to see Lewis Hamilton and he signed our tickets, which in itself was the icing on the cake to the weekend and whole holiday.
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Attractions|Montreal: Notre-Dame Basilica|4| “Worth a small visit”|review_376986315|My partner and I visited the Bascilica in Montreal last Summer during a trip in Montreal. Based on the number of reviews and advertisements we thought it was worth checking out. The surrounding area is the "old town" which was a beautiful setting and for a small price you can enter the Basilica and wonder around.We are not religious by any stretch of the imagination but the architecture and colours within were a sight to behold, it made us fully respect the religious belief of Montreal and was definitely worth our time.
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Hotel|Montreal: Hotel Ambrose|5| “Fantastic boutique hotel”|review_337019585|My partner and I stayed at the Hotel Ambrose during the formula one weekend in Montreal. Our decision to stay here was the value and location. The hotel is located on a quiet street but very close to the downtown and a subway station to help travel round the city quicker.The hotel itself is quite small and access to our involved using stairs but the room itself was excellent, a comfy bed and arty room. The hotel had a free breakfast offer which covered a mixture of cooked and chilled food, cereals and fruit which was a great way to start each day.i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good value hotel in Montreal.

Overall this is a great place to visit and a great atmosphere too.
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Restaurant|Chicago: Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery|3| “Decent place to grab food and a beer”|review_294354133|The Rock Bottom is actually a massive place inside, we had visited the place after a long day out to grab a bite to eat, we initially went up to the roof for a beer but realized it was quite crowded.The food here was really quite good and to be honest was better than the beer itself, my partner had a steak strip salad and thought it to be the best ever! I ordered a beer with my own meal but I didn't find it to be anything special, considering this was a brewery chain I expected a little more taste. There is a ton of TV's if you are into watching sport whilst you eat too. The service was OK I have read things about the staff being slow but I thought the guy that served us was efficient if a little quiet and timid.Would go back for a meal but wouldn't have any of the beer again.
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Attractions|Chicago: Lincoln Park Zoo|5| “Excellent Zoo and FREE!”|review_294352680|My partner and I visited the Lincoln Park Zoo during a recent visit to Chicago and were so glad we did. To get there is dead easy using public transport, we took a 146 bus from North Michigan Avenue which takes 10 minutes and stops right outside the zoo.The zoo itself is great, a really fun layout and great choices of animals, we first seen the lion who was walking about looking fairly angry and there was signposts and barrier up. We were initially worried what had happened but an older Zoo keeper (a bit like Carl Fredrickson from Up) was kind enough to explain that the lion was in heat.After the big cat area we walked around a new exhibit base don Africa which was really well laid out and had a great mix of animals and insects. We had a nice spot of lunch in a restaurant on site overlooking a small lake. We had a walk around the ape paddock and a few other animal exhibits, the place is fantastic to just walk around and get lost.
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Attractions|Chicago: Shedd Aquarium|3| “Established Aquarium but quite a little pricey”|review_294349875|I visted the Shedd Aquarium with my partner during a recent trip to Chicago, we arrived using the Divvy bikes (public bike system) and parked nearby (station in between the aquarium and museum).We did not pre-order any tickets and went for the general admission tickets ($8 each) as the full ticket ($35) was a little pricey for two of us, however the general admission price was not at first visible to us when we entered.We queued to pay for our ticket for around 15 minutes which was a little slow but as it was a very hot day we were glad to be in an A/C'd building. The aquarium has a really unique layout with the large centre tank and smaller habitats round about it. The general admission lets you see a lot of the standard exhibits of fish and marine life however it did not include 5 other main areas including the 4D experience. I do find it disappointing that a museum should have a tiered pricing structure that leaves you feeling like you should have paid more money to see all of the exhibits. The aquarium clearly is designed with the chicago passes in mind and we opted out of these as we wanted to do our own thing.Overall the aquarium was really nice to visit, clean and all marine life looked well cared for but if you do go expect to pay the $35 to make it worth your time

The pier is a great place to lose time, there are a variety of shops and restaurants to visit as well as an IMAX cinema. Above there is a small fairground and ferris wheel which was pretty cheap to go on, there is also various trips and hires available for boating excursions one of which we took was a 40 minute trip down the lake taking in some knowledge about Chicago and it's famous history.Well worth the visit
Simon D|95D9C7DEF04A9F57F9F9173FCD6CF804|Restaurant|Chicago: Osteria Via Stato|5| “Best Italian Food Ever - Ever”|review_294043533|This was my partner and I's first visit here during our first stay in Chicago, because we were staying at the Embassy Suites in the same block, we decided to venture into the OVS for our first night meal.To put it plain and simple the food here is probably the best Italian food ever, we had a selection of entrees and main courses with a great mixture of different cuisine. One of my entrees was Ravioli which was to die for, on top of the excellent food the table service was fantastic too, our waiter and table clearer were both brilliant to have and very nice to speak to which added warmth to the dark surroundings.Wish I got another chance to eat here, if anyone is thinking about going here it is highly recommended, initially we walked through the bar which was full of a party / young processionals and I was a little dubious but after a kind staff member noticing I looked left out and guided me to the restaurant.

Whats good - baggage handling is smooth, no problems. It flies and lands on time. Very short stopover at Bole Airport in Ethiopia and has very good leg space in economy class.What's not good - aircraft is usually old, food quality is very basic and raw, they don't serve whiskey on board, only basic wine and local made beer. Bole airport is horrible and dirty airport, don't expect to even do basic shopping at stopover and eat, it will be very expensive and poor quality. In flight entertainment has very limited choice and new content is not there.

Piyush G|1F2177067CFC815D22CC9230C86AAA18|Attractions|Dubai: KidZania Dubai|5| “Must go place for kids of all ages”|review_210018811|The ticket price is AED 140 which is kind of little expensive. I researched a bit and I purchased the combo ticket at just AED 97.50 from www.amazeme.ae which included Kidzania + Dubai Ice Rink. The AED 97.50 is just 50% of cost of both attractions individually.My son is 8 years old and he stayed at Kidzania for about 4 hours and still was not willing to come out. This place is spread across 2 storeys and have about 85 activities for kids to do in roleplay. Like they become policeman, work in bank, become fireman, work at pizza hut, become newspaper editors etc etc so many activities to do for them. When kids work they earn Kidzania money and can use that money at the toy shop inside (Hemleys) or buy Tattoo or evn food for themselves. Kidzania is beautifully designed from inside and is a replica of real world, kids definitely get to learn alot there and come out very happy. Most kid don't know that this place is two storey so they roam around on one floor only. Tell them before they enter this amazing kidzania. Also amazing is when kids work at pizza joint they make a real pizza and print a real newspaper and also they sing a corus song while they work as fireman, very entertaining and enjoyable.I must say its a must visit for kids of all ages. Even adults can go inside for AED95 ticket but they cannot perform any activity, only can guide their kid. But adults should not go inside and spoil kids activity. They should let the kids enjoy their little world without having someone guide them.Go for it guys, send your kids, prefer a weekday as on weekends this place is full of kids and they find it difficult to enjoy all acitivities.

Most staff is asian and speaks hindi very well.Location - hotel is 1 Km away from nearest metro station (Al-Karama) but still a good location. from here you can walk down to Meena Bazaar also (2km) or take a bus from outside the hotel. Taxis are always available outside the hotel and most importantly the grocery store (Jyothis) is just below next building (less than 100 mts) which is a very big plus.Overall our 4 nights stay at this hotel was very good, recommend this hotel to all.

I had booked this place before hand and made my way there after spending an hr with the the police. The reception I received was so distressing. At first i was refused check in. After speaking with his manager he agreed to check me in if i could prove my cc details. At no stage was help offered or any sympathetic ear just about the $$$$. I asked if he could call the bank so i could speak with them..i was told no and that was my job. Eventually it was figured out and i was allowed to check in. I have called front desk to try and speak with the police no return calls. If i was a women this would be handled differently! This trip for me has been a nightmare and my experience at front desk has just added to it.Apart from the ubissimal service the pizza i had room service was almost unedibile and the buffet breakfast eggs undercooked cold coffee and the usual grunting service.I would leave today if i could!

Everyone working here seems very young. My partner had a water damaged phone caused by one of the attractions and no one was interested on trying to help. 2 rides broke down on our day and after lining up for 40 mins when we decided to leave asked if we could have a fast pass when the attraction opens again we were told "people were there longer then you". Very dissapointing.

I had a cab waiting so i said can i pick it up when i get back and are you a 24hr reception. She said yes and no problem.I came back to a locked hotel with no reception. I had to sleep outside in the rain until someone opened up. When i got angry at the reception i was told cant you read the sign and he pointed at a be back in 10 sign. He was gone for at least an 90mins.Apart from that experience this place is over priced half attempt at a motel at best. There is no swimming pool.

Everyone was beyond helpful from Lula (i hope thats the right spelling) one of his city guides, Gero himself, and my tour guides Kenrick, Toucano and the rest of the group. I was actually emotional when I left I was so touched by the experience. The community was genuine with its warm welcome. I have been on so many tours around the world were there is an underlying feeling of needing to buy this coffee or this mat but there was none of this. One family opened up there house to me and we watched the soccer just awsome! This trip has realle inspired me to want to be more involved in my indigenous communites in Australia.

You name a club in the world and I have been to it. This was without a doubt the worst. I payed my cover and was inside for 10mins when a guy that turned out to work at the club asked me to hang outside. When I went to go back inside they said I had to pay again even though I had a wirstband. It was my birthday and I had friends inside so I did. When I was inside a barmen said he would put my jacket aside I said it was fine and as I did security grabbed me by the wrist and took me outside. I didn't understand why and they said if I wanted to go inside again I had to pay. I said no and that I wanted my jacket. Surprise there was no jacket I had just bought for 220aud. This morning I also discovered that they charged me an extra 100 pesos for my one drink I had inside. So my night in kika ended up costing about 400aud. Absolute thieves!!

I then had the prawns and my friend had the battered fish. The serving sizes were big enough that we could share each other's meals, the prawns are served in shell but they are easy to pop out, the fish was well cooked and the batter was tasted and not oily like you get at other fish and chip shops.We also tried the cocktails which were fabulous. The staff were attentive and friendly, the restaurant wasn't too loud so you can have a conversation while eating with out shouting at each other, all in all a wonderful night out. Will 100% be back for more.

Hubby and I came here before heading to universal for the day. These were the best pancakes I've ever eaten. I think the fun factor helped there though. The lemon curd was also to die for. Will 100% dream about coming back here for more pancake goodness

Hubby and I love aquariums, we make a point to visit them all when ever we go on a holiday.Saying this S.E.A. Was the best aquarium we have ever been to. The variety, dolphins, turtles, sharks, sharks, fish, did I mention sharks? It was also amazingly cool inside, after being in the 30+ heat outside it is wonderful to take your time and enjoy the colourful fishes and sharks!Make sure you go to the live talks if you're there in time, these are not only about the creatures them selves but they are also full of interesting information about the place, like the largest glass panel on one of the tanks.We will 100% be coming back here when we are in Singapore next.

I'm saying this because while we are both, let's face it, whimps but we still had a great time. It is worth getting a fast pass when you buy a ticket. We went mid week and the lines were still hours long. Some more simple rides and attractions had quick lines. The Jurassic rapids were so much fun (which is possibly why the line was over an hour long) the high flyer was also great and had no line.There was plenty of food available inside so don't feel the need to bring a lunch. Also, pack light, the more things you bring with you the more time you'll spend in the lines for the lockers at the start of rides. We had breakfast at a pancake place near the entrance before we went in, and spent a total of about 6 hours inside. Which was enough time to cover everything we wanted to do. Had we have wanted to do the big thrilling rides we would have been short on time. Those lines were over an hour each. I will 100% be coming back here. It was a great day out.

It was ok, I guess, we learnt a lot about the history and beliefs of the Singaporeans and the view was ok. They take photos of you for you at the mouth of the merlion, photos that you can purchase on your way out the door.....Not worth it if you have children in prams.... I don't think I would go back here.... at the most I would go back to Sentosa and look at it from the ground.

Claire H|0FFE8B9C32DF01CE853F78A47290A015|Restaurant|Melbourne: The Atlantic|5| “Romantic fish”|review_460257947|Hubby and I thought we would try all the restaurants at the crown while we were there, being the foodies that we are.I have to say as a dessert lover the best dessert I had the whole holiday was at the Atlantic. The fish was also amazing, we ordered whole fishies each, which the waitstaff fillet and none at the table side for you (if needed) we also got a range of sides to go with them, which is required unless you just want to eat fish on its own.The waitstaff are also really helpful when it comes to ordering. They don't just recommend the most expensive thing, their advise worth listening too.Tipping isn't required but is nice as this goes back to the staff we were told. If your in the area go for the desserts!!!100% will eat here again.

Haha well someone dressed as Elvis.Getting around the crown complex is so easy when you can cut through the casino and you don't have to walk all the way around (sorry families with children) While hubby and I don't gamble we still found plenty to do inside, from bars to food. It's a great place to kill an hour or two... more if you do actually play any of the games. Will of course 100% return here

While there wasn't many things to do at the time we got there, we do plan to go back and have dinner or lunch the next time we find ourselves on holiday in Melbourne.100% will visit and take many more photos.

By the end of our shopping I worried that we would need an extra suitcase.The food court here is good, but outside you'll find far better cafes and restaurants.Will 100% be coming back here next time we are in Melbourne.

Some of the food stalls are amazing, trust me.The shopping is general market things, trinkets and clothes. But the atmosphere makes this place what it is.From the markets it is very possible to walk to the museum and through the local gardens. Lovely way to spend a morning. They do close up at about 2 in the afternoon so to get the most out of it arrive early.100% will visit again

If you have time the shopping at the discount outlet stores is also well worth it.When we visited there was also a pirate shop docked here which was a very nice addition. 100% will visit again.

This place is amazing, the large walk through aquarium with mermaid statues and sharks, I spotted a turtle in one as well.It's also quiet educational to be honest.The penguins are adorable and stinky. There is a massive crocodile. Make sure if you go, that you catch the educational talks, these are quiet good. The whole place has ramps and such for prams/wheelchairs/ lazy people like myself who don't like stairs. It is just a really beautiful place to visit.Will 100% return

It was amazing!!! The show was fantastic, scary, sexy, thrilling, funny and amazing all at the same time. They don't recommend that you take children due to the mature themes and occasional nudity, so mums and dads get a babysitter cause this show was worth every penny.The food was ok, but trust me that's not what you come to Dracs castle for. The staff are brilliant! The decor is spot on, the cocktails are to die for..... even the jelly syringe. My cocktail was served with an eye in it and my husbands had a spider. Booking VIP was worth it, the drinks and snacks before hand and the better seating. Even just for the best seats in the house for the show. Be warned this place was full of vampires so I cannot be sure that every guest makes it out alive.

Very enjoyable to walk around, plenty of seating scattered around the place too. If you're in Melbourne with an hour or so to spare I would recommend having a quick look at the gallery.

The rooms are well appointed, the staff are friendly. As with any large people based operation problems do occur, it's how they deal with these when they happen. On our last stay the house keeping wasn't up to standard but upon letting the front desk know the issues were fixed and we were given free breakfast for the remainder of our stay.Of course 100% I will be back next time I have the need to fly to Melbourne.

So needless to say it holds some special memories for me, so I am a tiny bit biased in my review.It is a fantastic place for a walk, a picnic, relaxing on a blanket on the grass. Day or night kings park is worth the drive. Parking is free (which is nice in the city) the treetop bridge offers a great view of the river. What else can I say? Hubby and I will 100% be returning every chance we get.

Silks has been our yearly go to for Valentine's Day for the past three years, and it is always a wonderful treat.The food is always amazing, the service is great.This years tasting menu was very well put together, my favourite being the first yum Cha course. I would recommend trying the golden silks cocktail, this mango flavoured delight is served with a large spherical IceCube of mango goodness. Truely worth it!Hubby and I will 100% be returning next year for our forth Valentine's Day

Birds, while this sounds great I suppose the reality is birds bring bird droppings..... The wonderful staff ended up moving us to a different, bird free room. Which was great. Apparently the birds were getting in through the eaves. Which being that close to nature I guess is why you go down south.....All in all I will 100% be staying here again next time I head to bunker bay...... just minus the birds.

The cocktails are ok, I had a delightful rum and sour cherry thing. Read the menu though, friends weren't happy with all of their cocktail choices, but as the night went on they didn't care very much.It is a rum bar, which does mean they don't have vodka cocktails. I personally couldn't careless if it's rum or vodka in my drink, but I'm not a seasoned drinker.... They definitely haven't gone half assed on the deco, very very hula themed. Though quiet warm indoors. Do also take care sitting on the chairs near the walls in the down stairs bit... they sink just enough to whack your head on the wall behind you...... which is funny to watch but not at all fun to experience.Will return, quiet enjoyable.

Three plates of inedible pork belly, one charcoal burnt, one not even cooked and one not cooked with a side of hair. Booked ages ago, menu completely different when we get here, most menu items have run out, and the waitress has no idea what things like the 'dips' are tonight. (Menu just says weekly dips) finally get to order them she tells us which menu items are out, missed people on the table when taking the orders and just walked off. Chased down the manager (new owner) who then asked if we have been told there is a wait for food. Poorly run, bad service. All the excuses given. The only saving grace was the bar manager. Who was the only one to actually care. He was lovely and when he leaves here I can't imagine the place will survive.Will not be back, would not recommend.

We were wrongThe panda enclosure is the best, well maintained, the pandas look well fed, well looked after and they have the room that they need.Unfortunately this cannot be said for the rest of the animals in this zoo. The elephants are cramped, underweight, and stressed. There enclosure is small, completely in the sun and has no enrichment for these magnificent beasts.The tigers and lions are a little better looked after, more space and look better fed, but the enclosures are not up to standard.Don't go and look at the hyenas if you love animals, they are separated from each other (remember these are a pack animal) the enclosures they are kept in are mostly water with a tiny bit of land that they just pace back and forth on all day. Very disappointed, but I cannot advise that people not go, the only way things will improve for these creature is with funds. Catch 22 I think.

Which is wonderful on a..... well any day in KL. Massive selection of shops, hubby could have spent hours in the huge book store on the top floor.The food court is large with a decent selection of food, and the restaurants up stairs smell amazing. Will 100% go here again and again next time we are in KL
Claire H|0FFE8B9C32DF01CE853F78A47290A015|Attractions|Kuala Lumpur: Menara Kuala Lumpur|2| “Great view, nothing else”|review_439507215|Not sure if it is worth the price to be honest. The view is great but there are other ways to see it. It viewing deck area is full or tourist stalls and the constant photographers asking to take photos of you is very annoying. Hubby and I did this with our lunch reservation at the restaurant. Which if you must must see this tower. Then the restaurant is also an okay way to do this.....I do t think we will go back here again.

If you only have one night in Singapore go and see the night show..... then go do other things. The night show, the super tree grove lights up to music, I know it sounds simple, but it is truely amazing walking around in the grove during this. Don't feel bad walking around also, remember most people are looking straight up during. So you won't cut off anyone's view. Big tip, don't find a seat on the stairs to watch from a distance like the heaps of people you will see doing just this. Get down there. It's a completely different experience. Trust me.Will 100% visit again.

Would do this again 100%

We brought multi passes for the zoo and the night safari, which was also amazing.The zoo itself has a great variety of animals, the elephant show is a must see, get a seat up the front of the main stand to be first in line to purchase one of 20 baskets to feed the elephants after the show. The other animal show is also well worth seeing while you are here. Watching the polar bear play was another great pass time as one of the viewing windows is inside and it's lovely and cold!!!! Will 100% go again next time I am in Singapore.

My husband and I stopped by here on our last day just to see what it was all about, had I have known how amazing the night show was and I would have seen it more than once. The cloud forest dome is amazing, even if you are scared of heights like my husband... the flower dome is worth seeing if you are doing the cloud dome. Do the flower dome first, then wait until the sun goes down to go the the night show and the cloud dome once it is all lit up. Trust me. Will do this again 100%

All you could need and for the price in Singapore, very good..... The pool was great, clean and nice and cold.The shower pressure was not good however. Well priced as it is on the wrong side of the street, which you can only cross by bridge or underground tunnel when it is open.I will return to this hotel when I am in Sing next, hopefully they will have fixed there showers by then.

Before going into the restaurant they take you up to the viewing deck, they only let you go up 15 min before your restaurant booking and there isn't anything much worth doing here while you wait. The view is amazing though.Afternoon tea, the food was not so great, have had better in a food court. The view is amazing though and afternoon tea is the cheapest way to experience this revolving restaurant. I would say that it is worth doing once.

Good breakfast selections. Nicely maintained pool and public areas.HoweverThe bed could be softer, the pillows have a very bad smell. Even the replacement pillows stink. The bathroom STINKS the smell comes through the exhaust fans.... it is so bad you can't close the door while you're in there.... the towels also have stains on them..... Other than that, I would probably stay here again.

The hot and sour soup is also great. The pork and shrimp Sui mai are better than the pork and shrimp dumplings in my opinion.Service here is good and the staff don't hover over you while you eat so it's nice for couples. Really well priced too (from Australia) spent about 150rm for two people and we were so full.

Even with the weather (a few showers/heavy rain at times) it was still 100% worth every penny. Especially after seeing how the cheaper tour groups operate, we got a shuttle to the boat, they had a long walk to theirs. We had secluded private swimming spots after cruising past the packed and crowded beaches they were on. The paddlemen were great ours was able to tell us some things about the area and found lots of wildlife for us to look at (like the snake hanging from a tree right above us...) Would 100% do another tour with this company if we had time.

I do also understand what is happening here currently, my husband and I are here on honeymoon. Have been here for 5 days so far, with another 6 to go. ProsThey didn't have our room we booked available so they upgraded usThe Thai restaurant here is amazing, warm bananas in sweet coconut milk!!! Give it a go! The spa is fantastic 5 star ⭐️ we will be going again before we leaveConsThe buffet breakfast, while it has good choices have caught the staff picking up dropped food off the bench and putting it back in, also not changing out utensils that get dropped or handled...The room cleaning has been a huge issue every day, they take our towels and don't replace them, they don't replace the empty toilet rolls, we are constantly calling down for all these little things, we went out yesterday all day and the room wasn't done. It is a 300 baht taxi to get to Patong, that's a 600 round trip. The distance is nice, sometimes. There is a free shuttle bus, but you have to book before hand. It only goes 3 times a day. All in all.... I don't know.

Staff was friendly. Hotel concept is unique. They have chocolate for their signature. Welcome drink is ice chocolate,, but It will be great if the amenities in the room also about chocolate like chocolate shampoo or chocolate bathfoam. The room was good, I enjoy the bathtube and pool also. On second day, I do massage there. I choose the signature massage. Very refreshing. I expect will get some chocolate oil for massage because they have chocolate for their signature but I have just normal oil and not something about chocolate. Talking about restaurant, they have nelayan restaurant inside hotel. I like the food. Only 1 thing they need to double check is the crackers. Most of the food serve with crackers expecialy indonesian food. When I order nasi goreng for my 1st breakfast, the crackers is delicious. But in the afternoon and next day when I order mie goreng, the crackers smell not good. I don't know it come from the crackers or the oil. I also got same experience when I order spaghetti. Offer all hotel is good, will come back again. Hope will get better experience from their restaurant.

It was a short flight but we still were given a meal. This was probably the best flight we have been on with a decent kids meal. My son was given pancakes for breakfast which he thought was great.

Business class were called first, that was fine and once they had boarded everyone was invited to proceed to the gate. We were told we could line up in the business class lane to be processed so we did. I got through and then one of the staff told the rest of the line that they had to go to the back of the economy line. The stupid thing about that was then there was only one person processing passengers while the other staff member stood there doing nothing. Eventually they started processing people through the business class lane again. We got to the door of the plane and the steward crew were busy talking to each other and not greeting passengers and if they did it was a rushed "Hello" and then told which way to go to get to the seat. We, along with a lot of other passengers were told to go the wrong way to get to our seats and had to try and back track to get to the other side of the plane. The crew we had tending to us seemed stressed and were quite curt with people. The toy my son was given was not age appropriate at all and we were only given half the pack that he received on the flight over. The food wasn't that nice and the choices, as always were limited. I don't like spicy food, but both choices were spicy fish or chicken. The movie selection was poor which made for a long flight.

The night we went there were at least 5 tourist buses parked there. But as soon as the sun went down the place emptied out really quick. If you are going up there by taxi then I would recommend that you book a return trip as there didn't seem to be any taxi's waiting around up there. Thankfully one of the other drivers rung and got one for us.

We were here for four days the first time and then one night on the way back. Our room on the 15th floor was adequate as a base, but you really didn't want to spend much time there. The lighting in the bathroom was really poor. The bed that they gave my 5 yo son was just a chair that converted into a very small fold out bed. It was horribly uncomfortable. I put two duvets under him to try and make it more comfy and then waited over an hour for housekeeping to bring us some more so that we could go to sleep. I really should have complained and insisted on a proper bed for my son. The buffet breakfast was mediocre,the food wasn't that great and the selection was poor. It was edible tho. There wasn't nearly enough tables in the restaurant so a lot of people ended up standing around waiting. One thing I did find that really annoyed me, was when I was dealing with the front desk staff, they would attend to the Asian guest first, even if I was ahead of them in the line or they would stop part way through my dealings to attend to someone else. I found this so rude. On the return trip we stayed one night and the room on the 13th floor was much better and had a proper bed for my son. The rooms were meant to be non-smoking but you could smell people smoking when you walked down the corridors. The coin operated laundromat was useful. The hotel is old and is in need of a make over. It is not central to tourist areas of Singapore, but there is an MRT (train) station near-by that is easy to use, quick and cheap.

We had free tickets to get in which was good as it is normally quite expensive. We purchased a one off express pass for S$50 each which gave us one express entry per ride. It was well worth it as some of the rides had wait times of 40+ mins which to be fair isn't unreasonable for a theme park. But with it being so hot and with a young child it was better to jump to the front. The park is very clean. It was very crowed with tourists (to be expected).

It's nice and clean and the rooms are good. Our bed was rock hard and had roll together which made for four bad nights sleep. We discovered on the last day that the bed was broken underneath hence the roll together. The buffet breakfast was nice but the hot food was only ever warm at best.

There was a very comfy king bed in the main bedroom and bunk beds and a single bed in the second bedroom. The shower had great pressure. There is also a great little playground for the kids and a big bouncy pillow for the kids (and adults!!) to play on. Staying there gives you discounted access to the pools. It would be nice if there was a free pool available for guests as the cost soon adds up for a family - for us it would have been around an extra $40. The rooms were clean and tidy. We will be back.

The room was big enough for us to not be tripping over each other. We had a ground floor room which opened out on to a grass area, ideal for the kids to run around. The pool is fantastic and has lifeguards on duty from 7am to 9am. Easy access to SeaWorld Park thru the resort is handy. We've loved our stay here.

I thought it was expensive for what we got, a piece of fish was $6 & large chips are also $6. The fish was nice but the chips weren't that great. We also got seafood sticks which were soggy. I think it's overrated and expensive. But it obviously popular as they were very busy but were quick at getting orders out which was good.

Having recently moved to a different town we came back to visit friends and stayed here and were very happy. We stayed one night and thought it was fantastic. The room we had was modern and clean and warm. There were enough beds to sleep 6. The main bedroom had a very comfy king/superking bed so we were able to get a brilliant nights sleep. The location is quiet and peaceful. We ate dinner in the on-site restaurant and our meals were delicious. This motel is used a lot by long haul truck drivers as an over night stop. There were 9 big Mac trucks parked up on-site overnight but we didn't hear any of the leave in the morning. The staff were all very friendly. We will be back in the future. Thank you

The Buddha is massive and they have done an amazing job building it. The view from up there is fantastic. Entry is free, but there is one or two donation boxes around which seemed like the right thing to do. We were lucky enough to see several families of monkeys as we were going up the walk way. They were very cheeky and not over afraid of us. We weren't going to touch them tho...they're wild after all! On the way down we stopped and patted a few elephants that were chained up on the side of the road having breakfast before starting the elephant treks for the day. It was a lovely morning out.

Just perfect”|review_254059569|We stayed here for 7 days for our honeymoon after purchasing a voucher from Grabone. The road up the the resort makes you a little concerned as it's a rough broken alley, but when you arrive at the resort it is truly stunning. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the complementary cold drink on arrival while checking in is most welcomed!We upgraded our room to the Royal Jacuzzi Suite and it was beautiful. Very spacious and lovely furnishings. The bed....the bed was amazing! It was 8 feet wide! My husband and I could both starfish and still not touch each other! The pool was fantastic and the view out to sea was lovely. The swim up bar and happy hour each afternoon just made it all the more better. The resort is at the quieter end of the island which suited us perfectly. We hired a scooter and just zoomed around the local area when we wanted to go somewhere. If we didn't we just lazed by the pool or in the outdoor jacuzzi in our room with a view across the sea. Breakfast was great and was cooked fresh to our specific order. We ate out for every lunch and dinner at the local restaurants. Our favorite being Kook's at the end of Mangosteen Alley. The resort offers a free shuttle several times a day to Nai Harn beach which is an amazing place. We took the scooter there and it is so beautiful. We loved every minute of our stay here. It was more than we could have asked for and we can't wait to go back. We had our free breakfast and listened to the marketing pitch from Ian (who has a fantastic sense of humor!) and after some consideration my husband and I signed up to the Mangosteen Club. The benefits are brilliant and with several big family holidays coming up over the next few years we will defiantly be making very good use of it.

I sent off an email and got a very quick and friendly response. I gave Wandee the list of things that we would like to do and she was able to put together an itinerary for us and gave recommendations on what would and wouldn't be possible to fit in on our day trip. Her prices were very reasonable. We booked in to do the VIP program at the Tiger Temple, Elephant bathing, the Death Railway, and the Bridge over the River Kwai. We were picked up at 5am by Wandee and she drove us North to the attractions. It was a very smooth ride and she let us doze and answered any questions we had. Closer to our destination we picked up our English speaking guide Yee. Yee was brilliant. She had fantastic English and was very knowledgeable. She stayed with us the whole time and was able to guide us on the do's and don't and answer all our questions. She also took lots of great photos for us. We had an amazing time and would highly recommend Wandee Tours to everyone.We also got Wandee to pick us up from the airport and drop us at our hotel and then the return trip when we left. She was very reasonably priced (much cheaper than a taxi! and much more comfortable ride). She met us in the airport with a sign and had cold water for us which was great. Overall brilliant service!

There was a lovely platter of small sweet cakes, 2 boxes of Herseys Kisses, a platter of sushi, 2 bottles of spring water and a lovely chocolate cake welcoming us to our honeymoon. It was really nice and welcomed after a long flight from Auckland. The room was nice, but the decor is very dark and we felt that there wasn't enough lighting in the room. I wouldn't recommend staying here if you have a mobility issue as there was about a 2 foot climb to get into the bath/shower and no steps to help. The room was starting to look a bit tired. The bed was rock hard, but we were tired so slept well. The staff were helpful and the view from the roof at night is fantastic.

We eat at Slappy pancakes since it will open at 10am, going in is fast and organized. There isnt a lot of people so we are not rushing in to go in line. in fact the longest waiting time we had is 20 mins which is the Transformer ride. HIGHLY recommended to ride. No need for express pass though there is still few people purchase it. it was a really hot day so we didnt bother to going in and out to buy some food outside to save some money. The food we purchased range SGD10-15 for a regular burger meal. Milkshake is SGD7, ice cream SGD4. for souvenir I find it too pricey when converting since I came from Manila on ROE is 1PHP=35SGD just imagine it. The Hollywood parade start at 3pm very great show. I must also commend BETTY BOOP mascot is very nice.. Taking pictures with mascot are everywhere you must only ques.

There is no unity who would go first and tour guides very unaware what to do, its like diskarte maka baba. I have seen the president of the Maynoba hiking eklabu, but men he didnt do anything. He even manage to singit haha. They got to go first, when we are in line at back waiting for any movement. I cannot explain well the scenario. Continuing on Mt. Maynoba. after were on the resting hill of Maynoba (i dont what called). we manage to get some good pictures (finally). We were asked again if we wanted to go Maynoba summit . PLACE is crowded and we will just experience what we had on Cayabu Summit. very very crowded. Im kinda ashame that I had to drag my friends here that they will see the sea of clouds, unfortunately not worth hiking even on the Falls. Trail is very easy compare to what we hike before. The only highlights to this travel is nag swimming kami sa tita ko. Dun lang kami nag enjoy. Rest house with pool. Wohooo. Meron rin pala sidetrip swimming sa Brgy. 100 ata entrance.Kung gusto nyo libre sa river pasama kayo sa tour guide nyo, pero wag kayo feeling swimmer may part na malalim at mababaw. dun kayo sa mababaw lang. Tour guide - Kuya Amboy Sana naman mag pa reservation na lang kayo. super congested talaga yung area

We I order is Fettuccine Carbonara that comes with garlic breads.I like how the breads were perfectly baked, soft and full garlic flavor.Carbonara was okay nothing to be fascinated about, same goes with Tuna sandwhich. ( i just find the cheese extra ordinary)For my other colleagues, they said the food was average,For the dessert we taste the chocolate mouse and mango something. Sorry I forgot.The choco mouse was like tasting a marshmallow but quick melting. I cant hardly to explain.The mango Graham was okay also not to sweet.Overall I would love to come back again.

I been to vikings and i was like serve 1-2 pcs and then no more cooking. The cleanliness of our table is like we have to raise our hand to have it clean. We were asked to make feedback at little start of our eating. So I mostly rate them 2 star, as I havent seen the service yet. Better choices of desserts than the vikings. To the celebrant much better of greeting them. Singing and blowing of candles. Equally treated. As in vikings you have to wait to be sing by the "band" and sometimes they skip you.

Purchased the standard tickets for about USD 40 pp. Really enjoyed the rides especially the duelling "battle star galactica" ride, which is not for the faint hearted and the Egyptian section which featured an indoor ride with all sorts of Egyptian monsters to keep us company. The 3D "Transformers" ride was also truly enjoyable. The kids also fully enjoyed the 3D movie at Never Never Land. My main grouse however was the very long waiting time for each and every ride. We were only able to complete 5-6 rides during the whole day and each ride had a waiting time of 1 hour or more. So I strongly recommend new visitors especially those with families and/or have just one day to visit, to pay extra and buy the fast track tickets. Else you are in for a long wait and risk get your blood pressure up (as I did) by fuming silently at those with fast track tickets sauntering in while you are in the queue for hours...

We ordered 8 or so bites/starters and no mains and as beautiful as they all looked on the menu, other than the charcuterie board they failed to deliver. I have had a couple of great meals at BB in the past but this time it was bland, non eventful hotel lobby food not worthy of a Mandarin Oriental

Not a good experience and certainly not a restaurant I would recommend.On a separate note, my family wasn't wildly impressed by the meal but at least they managed to keep their food down.
Tarekz8|7598963A000AB042E1D0E34DF1EBB159|Restaurant|Singapore: Mr & Mrs Moghans Super Crispy Prata|5| “Off the beaten teack”|review_460554338|Drag yourself away from the glitz and glamour of Singapore and visit the non assuming gem.We went there to munch on pratas for breakfast and they were sensational. Plain, egg, cheese - we ate the lot with a lovely lentil based side.Street food at its best, just stay away from the coffee!
Tarekz8|7598963A000AB042E1D0E34DF1EBB159|Restaurant|Singapore: Shabuya shabu shabu|4| “Great food lousy service”|review_459986601|I could not fault the food. There is a great variety on offer and everything we tried was delicious.The service was sub par but at least it was constantly sub par from the moment we walked in to paying our bill and heading out.Having said that, I would suck up the crappy service and go back for the food!
Tarekz8|7598963A000AB042E1D0E34DF1EBB159|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|5| “Everything hurts!!!”|review_459984592|But in a good way. After 7 hours and a total of 10km covered over the course of the day; the kids saw, did and ate everything and they had a blast doing it.The park needs a full day and don't be cheap, buy the express passes otherwise you will spend the entire day waiting in line.Cylon, Transformers and the Shrek 4D were great brilliant fun. The Jurassic Park ride was not a favourite. You simply got soaked for the sake of it. It was as if the inventors ran out of ideas and figured getting people wet was a sufficient substitute for a lack of imagination. It is an expensive day out the entire family thoroughly enjoyed themselves.
Tarekz8|7598963A000AB042E1D0E34DF1EBB159|Hotel|Singapore: Regent Singapore, A Four Seasons Hotel|5| “Very welcoming”|review_459573795|So I'll start with the single negative point. The rooms are a little tired. They are not terrible but you would want a little more from a Four Seasons property. Everything else was amazing. The service really is second to none. The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and truth be told I would return based on the service alone.

Tarekz8|7598963A000AB042E1D0E34DF1EBB159|Restaurant|Copenhagen: Host|5| “Great food and laid back”|review_457710530|We opted for the 5 course menu which we all thoroughly enjoyed. The staff were very knowledgable and extremely accommodating to changes in the menu (one guest was gluten free). The chef sprinkled the menu with a number of surprises so 5 dishes quickly became 8 and all very enjoyable in their own right.
Tarekz8|7598963A000AB042E1D0E34DF1EBB159|Hotel|New York City: New York Hilton Midtown|3| “Needs to try harder”|review_453657840|As a hotel, the Hilton was decent. The rooms were spacious and well kept, hotel facilities such as gym and coffee shops were great and internet connectivity was reasonably stable. Staff were polite but not particularly helpful. The concept of good service appears to be lost, simply very utilitarian in their approach which is fine if you don't want repeat business.Truth be told it has been a long time since I have travelled to the US and may have lost touch with the way things are done but everything seemed incredibly transactional. Fees for bag storage, fees for having packages delivered, a fee for late checkout even though I am a HHonors diamond member.It's not an issue of money but rather the cheek of sticking a price tag on every tiny item and as a member of the loyalty program, I do not expect to pay for the services. I am more than happy to tip but this should be my prerogative. So that's my 2c worth. A little effort and they could change staying at the Hilton Midtown from an average to a good experience.
Tarekz8|7598963A000AB042E1D0E34DF1EBB159|Attractions|London: MyTaxe|1| “Would have preferred to ride a three legged donkey home”|review_452983518|What a disaster, not sure where they found this driver but if he is a reflection of the service they offer, I can only hope that in the interest of road safety they go bankrupt soon.Firstly the driver was not present when I arrived at Heathrow, secondly he asked me to make my way to the departures terminal where I was rushed into the car because he stopped in a "no stopping area". Had I been kidnapped , there wouldn't be that much pressure to get me into the vehicle.Throughout the drive, I had to endure listening to his endless phone calls which although irritating was not as much of a concern as the driver pissing around on his mobile phone throughout the ride. Call me old fashioned but hands should be on the wheel and eyes on the road.Cherry on the cake was he tried to tout his services to me for the remainder of my stay. Clearly he thought I had a death wish. I would sooner walk home than get into a car with this driver again.Dreadful
Tarekz8|7598963A000AB042E1D0E34DF1EBB159|Restaurant|Dubai: Wakame|5| “Awesome”|review_432273205|My wife and I took the Omakase menu and it was brilliant. Great variety, beautifully prepared and truly delicious dishes. Service was excellent. It wasn't cheap but well worth the money.
Tarekz8|7598963A000AB042E1D0E34DF1EBB159|Hotel|Riyadh: InterContinental Riyadh|3| “Old reliable”|review_415449160|The hotel is in a good part of town with decent security so you feel safe.Breakfasts and dinner buffets have a wide offering of delicious food from across the globe.Staff are courteous and helpful. Common areas (lobby) are comfortable and clean.Rooms are hit and miss. If you get an older room (and on this stay I did), they are dark and drab, I would even go as far as saying dingy but they are large. Furniture is tired, bathrooms are clean and functional but that is about it. The A/C sounds like a jumbo jet getting ready for take off and at night this leaves you with two options: boil to death or stay cool but awake. Having said all that, it is probably the better hotels in Riyadh at the price point.
Tarekz8|7598963A000AB042E1D0E34DF1EBB159|Hotel|Beirut: Le Gray Beirut|5| “First Class”|review_414558141|From the moment their driver picked me up to the time I checked out, I felt like a valued customer. The staff are polite and super helpful without being intrusive. They go out of their way to help. The rooms are beautifully designed whilst maintaining comfort and practicality.The meals I had on the hotel were fine. I can't complain about them but they were missing the wow factor, especially for the prices they charged. My only criticism (and this would have been a big issue if I were traveling for business) is that the Internet is insanely slow and in this day and age, this should not be the case.All in all a wonderful stay and I will be sure to return next time I am in town.
Tarekz8|7598963A000AB042E1D0E34DF1EBB159|Hotel|Madikwe Game Reserve: Impodimo Game Lodge|5| “Fantastic”|review_409616157|This truly is a sensational place to stay. As well as being extremely well looked after, you are in the heart of the savannah. Impodimo is an open lodge which I think makes the experience. There are no fences so seeing animals casually stroll past your veranda is common place and only adds to the safari experienceThe guides and the spotters are superb and highly trained. As long as you listen to them you are in safe hands. The team is accommodating and the food is first classA memorable experience.

Rooms were beautiful and well maintained and the staff went out of their way to make the entire family feel welcome. A short but wonderful stay, definitely my hotel of choice when I am next in town
Tarekz8|7598963A000AB042E1D0E34DF1EBB159|Restaurant|Hermanus: Burgundy Restaurant|4| “A little gem”|review_405506847|Simple menu with a couple of interesting twists. Staff were welcoming, service was great and food was wholesome and tasty. By no means, high end dining but great food.
Tarekz8|7598963A000AB042E1D0E34DF1EBB159|Restaurant|Hermanus: La Pentola|2| “Oh dear...”|review_405506405|Service: staff were friendly and had a deep understanding of the menu. This made ordering a pleasure. However service was undoubtedly slow, waiting just over 40 mins between courses and 30 mins for a bottle of water, even with a reminder. After they took the order, the staff were nowhere to be seen, I suspect there is a tardis round the back. Starters: the salad and carpaccio were simple and delicious. Ingredients were fresh, hard to go wrong. The ostrich trinchado was a non event. Flavours of the sauce overpowered the entire dish, presentation was poor - wouldn't bother.Mains: the selection on the menu is varied and interesting but again the execution was poor. We all enjoyed the warthog although by the time it reached us the sauce was somewhat conjealed. The crocodile pastry was over seasoned, relying on an unsophisticated curry sauce to hold the whole thing together. The abalone was edibleDessert: having waited so long for our mains and with a flight to catch in 3 days, dessert was a high risk proposition we thought best to avoid.Summary: whoever put the menu together, I truly get their vision and what they want to achieve. It is creative, novel and exciting. Perhaps I simply showed up on the wrong night but that really is no excuse for the "car crash" of a meal we were served. Unless these guys can pull it together, there are far better places to spend your hard earned money.

Roast goose is definitely a must try, but we find that the skin was too oily and thick. We tried to order the roast goose drumstick but the waiter rejected us by saying a loud "NO!". After several tries we ended up ordering normal roasted goose which was okay. Overall it's a nice little place worth a try if you around Central.

AVOID”|review_129553450|We booked this hotel from a famous hotel book maker months before arriving. We arrived at the hotel around 2.30pm (30 minutes late from actual check-in time). Upon checking in, the staff informed us that only 1 room (of our 4 rooms) are available since the room is still "not ready". The negotiation went on that we wanted a late check-out for this case. It was instantly denied. We decided to walk around Nathan Rd. till 4pm which the staff promised as our check-in time. The time came and we head back to the hotel realizing that one of the rooms are still unavailable due to certain "circumstances" that we have to wait till 4.30pm. We totally understand that the hotel was congested due to some circumstances but having waited hours for our room was just in-tolerable. Check-out time was a mere 1pm.

You can sit looking out at the beach/sea either inside or outside. Salads are huge and amazing. Calamari tasty. This restaurant you actually get proper fries, not the fried potato crisps. All good.

Think we paid €11 and it was all you can eat. Food hot and tasty. Not all sushi so something for everybody. Salads etc too. Nice clean environment. Selection of deserts too included. If you want something cooked to order then price I think was €14. You won't leave hungry that's for sure.

Situated in tranquil countryside. Pool is available all year but not heated. No steps into it but it's not deep. Good to cool down in. Sunbeds available. Water in an outdoor fridge for you to use. The food- well what can I say - in my opinion amazing true Sardinia food. And lots of it. Breakfast is fresh bread and jams/marmalades with good coffee. You can request something in particular if you want. Lunch was amazing- we rolled out of the restaurant ! Table covered in antipasta which was delicious, followed by pasta. This was then followed bowl of fresh celery etc, then meat course arrived. After that fresh fruit in a large bowl came then a big tray of biscuits appeared. This was accompanied by wine and water already on the table. Dinner was again an abundance of food. Just like lunch with all different courses with a glass of mirto made by owner to help digest your food. Amazing place. Not a sound can be heard at night and in the simple and very clean rooms you can enjoy a very good nights sleep. We visited burumini and gesturi from here. We explored the ruins at burumni with an English speaking tour costing €10 each. Well worth it. This was followed by visiting the restaraunt across the road for pizza and pasta. In the afternoon we headed up to the plateau to see the wild Sardinian horses. Be aware the drive is steep up very windy single track roads with sheer drops at the side at times. You need decent footwear e.g. Either robust trainers or walking shoes as you are walking on uneven tracks for some distance to see the creatures through wooded areas etc. Back to the b&b for lie by pool and in October it was just nice. Dinner again was amazing. Owners so very nice. If you go enjoy

Tickets can be bought at the tabachi across the road where shops / cafes are. I usually by the 10 ride ticket for €12. The ticket needs to be put in the machine on the bus to stamp it or you could get a fine. Bus takes bout 15 mins. Can get very busy so in summer just wait for next bus as poetto express runs every 5 mins or so. You will see the sea as you approach the beach as the bus turns the corner to go along the road parallel to the lagoon. Any stop along there is good. The third stop takes you along towards the lido. There are many places from June 1st where you can rent parasols and sun beds. This will cost you approx €15 each a day. Gives you access to shower and loos. If you don't want to pay that then walk along the beach and there are parts where you and you're towel can lie for free. It's a beautiful spot but does get incredibly busy. Sea is lovely. You can chill there all day as there are now cafes / restaurants along the beach to have drinks or lunch etc. Malibu serves tasty food. Men walk the beach selling beer/water and granitas. Granita is about €2 or €3 euro but refreshing in heat. Beer is cheap. Once you're all. Watched out you can enjoy a walk along the new walkway right along. A good day out.

Fruits of the sea with spaghetti is perfect for seafood lovers. Risotto always a hit with my husband. Opens at 8pm. Quiet at this time then gets really busy around half 9. Reasonable prices.

It takes you past several points of interest e.g churches as well as out to the beach front and lagoons where you can see the flamingos. It was either 8€ or €10 euros can't remember. On getting on the small tour bus (which has open sides and sometimes they take roof off , giving a much needed cool breeze in summer) you are provided with earphones to plug into a running commentary. This will be set to ur language of choice by the driver. This is good to listen to on the drive. The tour lasts about an hour. You get a photo opportunity at the very top of cagliari looking out across the whole city on one side and a view of the lagoons on the other. A good trip to take.

The centre were informative and well equipped. Definitely value for money. Opportunity to snorkel with the creatures, but if that's not your thing it's not a problem just to watch from the boat. The staff are great, friendly and it's great fun. My husband also tried the taster scuba dive, and wished he had left more time to do additional dives as he loved it and Moses was great, and very patient during the induction. It involved the morning in pool learning about the breathing apparatus etc, then after lunch he headed back up to the dive centre to go out for his first ever dive in the bay. Was amazing he said. The centre is only a short walk, 5 mins, from Cassa Barry Lodge where we stayed. Definitely worth a visit.

If you are looking for a tranquil place to kick back and chill then this is for you. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at the Lodge and they are without doubt a really friendly bunch of people, welcoming and the whole place is very well managed. The reed cassita we stayed in was set back from the beach where we fell asleep at night to the sound of the sea.The cassita had an ensuite, and the beds had mosquito nets. On arriving we got given towels for the beach which was great. A large fan was provided to cool the room. We did not spend a lot of time in the room, as weather was just beautiful, but it was excellent. There is the facility to have your clothes washed through by the staff, which I did not expect, but if you haven't a lot of clothes with you this is excellent to have. Daily room service a real bonus. The cassita had a veranda with table and chairs too. If you chose to lie on the beach then the lodge has some parasols with sunbeds at the foot of the steps of the bar, so cold drinks handy too! Wifi is available in restaraunt/bar. Activities are a plenty including ocean safaris, diving, surfing, snorkelling, yoga to name just a few. Dive centres walking distance. Talks take place in the evenings about the whale sharks, manta rays and fauna found around the shores of Tofo Beach if you wish to attend, delivered by the resident scientists. Very informative. The Lodge has a restaurant serving tasty dishes, large portions, and you can sit with your drink watching the sun go down from the deck of the bar. Magical. The local town, which is a short 5 min walk up the beach has a wee market, and some really good places to eat. Very good value for money everywhere we went and everything we did. We took a local taxi to Inhambane one day and after our wandering had lunch overlooking the estuary where we were fortunate enough to see dolphins! My husband tried the scuba diving and thoroughly enjoyed himself, and we both took the ocean safari trip where we saw devil rays, dolphins, turtles, flying fish etc. This is a real 'getaway from it all' place and somewhere we plan to visit again soon. We highly recommend Cassa Barry as a great place to stay. Simply cannot say enough about this place. Loved it all.

The ambiance was very nice, the staff were courteous and professional, the food and wine came out promptly, and everything tasted fantastic. Manesh was our fantastic server, and even went to the trouble of advising us from ordering too much as the sizes of their dishes differed from the places we usually go to. The prices were extremely reasonable, and they even brought out a complimentary dessert and sang to us to celebrate our Anniversary.

As we booked a watervilla, they had a promotion for guests to upgrade to Hurawalhi for free. We unfortunately had a bad experience with the dive shop on Komandoo, and thankfully we were able to spend 5 out of 7 days on Hurawalhi. The new resort was absolutely spectacular, and truly memorable. Great array of food choices, and the wine list was a great addition compared to the previous 2 resorts. Can't say enough about Prodivers. My wife and I are really into diving and environmental conservation, so getting to interact with the Manta Trust on our dives was fantastic. Arnaud was our dive instructor, and was top-shelf in and out of the water. We can't wait to go back to visit the whole team at Hurawalhi. Thanks for making our Honeymoon the best!!

You can get tickets for 5 RM to cross the causeway on the KTM trains from JB Sentral to Woodlands and back. The taxi from Woodlands to USS was about $24, but well worth it considering all the different buses and trains we would have had to take, and would have been almost $20 for 2 people. We visited during the tail-end of Chinese New Years, but was pleasantly surprised at the short wait times. On a few rides we too the single riders lane and got put on the same ride anyways.

Prodivers Kuredu was fantastic. Pierre was our Divemaster and was a pleasure to dive with. We did our Enriched Air Course with him, as well as a dive on the house reef/wreck. He was very patient and professional, as well as completely prepared for any issues that arose - he had a spare mask on hand that my wife was able to utilize when her mask failed, a detail we only learned AFTER walking all the way from the dive shop and down the jeti and into the water with all our equipment on! My family rented snorkels and fins and we were able to photograph and identify a new turtle for the Manta Trust Marine Biologist Team! We were planning to spend our honeymoon on Komandoo, but as they had an upgrade to Huravahli available to Ocean Villa guests, we opted to take that offer. The whole Prodivers Team on Huravahli was amazing. We only had 20+ dives experience but they were more than happy to organize dive trips to suit our levels, and we joined couples and others divers who had much more experience than us. Arnaud was our Guide and and can't say enough about him. Kind, courteous, professional, positive, and polite. He gave great suggestions that really helped to improve our dive experiences. The boat crew were very efficient and these two branches of Prodivers gave us memories and experiences to enjoy for many years to come. I must mention however, that we had a bad experience with the Komandoo branch staff. I don't like leaving negative reviews, and try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but the staff there left me pissed off and my wife in tears. They made us feel unwelcome, and like they didn't need/want our business. We chose this resort largely influenced by the diving we would be able to do, so when we were told we wouldn't be able to do a lot of the dives because we would hold the other divers (which one of the staff members physically showed me all of their details containing their dive experience) back, we were very put off. Thank God Huravahli was there, and literally saved our Honeymoon. I have no doubt that the Prodivers staff on Komandoo are qualified, but I would suggest a refresher course on customer service. No one wants to travel that distance and spend that kind of money to be treated like that. I would absolutely recommend Prodivers to anyone visiting the Maldives, and I refuse to let a few staff members who probably had an off day affect our overall positive experience with a great company. Thanks again, and look forward to diving with you guys in the future. Casey and Tammy

From start to finish, we enjoyed every aspect of our stay. The staff was courteous, professional, and happy to help in every way. Sammee, our check-in/concierge host, was so friendly and full of personality, and made our experience that much more memorable. He even offered to be our Minister for our wedding, which brought a HUGE smile of surprise to my bride's face on our special day when she found him with me together at the alter. Candice was beyond helpful and made the wedding run smoothly. Anna put together an absolutely beautiful wedding picture package from Pix. Our Housekeeping extraordinaire Riyaz was fantastic and very talented at making towel animals for us to come back to. We tried almost all the restaurants on the island and have no complaints whatsoever to make about them. Franco's was a favourite, and dinner at the Beach was our gorgeous post-wedding site. Prodivers Kuredu branch was a dream to deal with, and we did our orientation dive on the house reef and wreck with Pierre, as well as our Enriched Air Padi course. My cousin and I did a 4 hour fishing excursion on a small boat, and we landed a 20 pound giant blue travali fish which I will never forget. Do NOT miss the White Party! Absolutely brilliant!!

How does this place have 500 reviews, and rank top 15 in KL??? The staff for the most part didn't seem to want to be there, and not friendly at all. No uniforms, no atmosphere to speak of, and hidden by all the markets selling knockoffs on Petaling Street. At least one of the waiters smiled when we asked for the bill. The chicken shawarma showed up by itself on a plate wrapped in fast food paper, and didn't have anything it said it would on the menu, no garnish at all, and was pretty pathetic. The hummus was swimming in oil. 90 RM for dinner for two, I expected ALOT better. Fast food quality for restaurant prices in my opinion. Either the reviewers have very little experience with Arabic style food, or the reviews are fake. Bottom Line. If you are walking down Petaling Street and you want some Arabic-esque food, maybe give them a try. Otherwise I would't recommend going out of your way to go here, you'll be disappointed.

Breakfast buffet was good, great central location, and easy access to many places around the city. Would stay again :) parking was a pain as you had to drive to the 6th floor to get to hotel parking. Rooms could use a few touch-ups, but other than that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

Charged 50 RM for 3 adults + car. The hike was decent, but there was trash and garbage EVERYWHERE. Not only were locals leaving their garbage, but it looked like the place hadn't been cleaned in months. The lower area was ok for a swim, but don't waste your time.

I sat at the bar during some down time waiting for marriage papers to be processed at our local embassy. The menu and signs cater to both locals and foreigners and both cultures, and the prices are extremely acceptable considering the city they operate in. Tried the spinach dip.... Awesome, and the assortment of beautifully Hoppy beers washed it down well. These guys have truly fused the western and local flavours and experience into a place that shows the locals what craft beer and homemade western food is all about, and where expats can feel a little less homesick. Well done guys

The island was fantastic! Booking.com gave us some problems with the booking, but the problem was sorted out quickly upon arrival. We stayed I one of the family bungalows for two nights, and the monkey bungalow for one. The food was fantastic, the hosts were very friendly and professional, and overall I would say this place is a must if you want to stay in a little piece of heaven while in Cambodia! We will definitely be back! The boat ride is really slow and long though, so pack some tunes!

They sent a very friendly tuk tuk driver to pick us up from the airport, and we ended up using him for the duration of our stay. The hotel is a perfect distance away from the hustle and bustle of pub street, but close enough to walk. After long days walking around the temples, a dip in the pool was perfect. The owner was always present and very attentive. I would definitely recommend this hotel to any couple planning to spend a few days in Siem Reap.
Casey V|7474AF5E08369D47D7C0EE80D64F8A85|Hotel|Malindi: Driftwood Beach Club|5| “Just Fantastic!”|review_152936374|My boyfriend and I stayed at the Driftwood for 2.5 weeks from the end of January to mid February this year. We couldn't be happier with our first experience to Malindi! Roger took the time to help us organise day trips to Malindi, Gedi, Watamu, Che Shale, and also recommended a great safari company to take us to Tsavo East for a few days. The staff were extremely friendly, and many remembered the previous owner from more than 15 years ago when he paid a visit. Bimba (the pool bar bartender) was especially helpful, and gave us top notch service every time we saw him. The food was fresh, delicious, and amazing. The pool side bar was lively on weekend evenings, bringing many expats and locals alike. Friday night is club night, where they grill your choice of meats in front of you beside the pool. Saturday night, Roger personally cooks up his famous Karoga (beef-curry type dish) which goes perfectly with an ice cold tusker! Curry lunch on Sunday is a packed house and many local Italians who are tired of pasta come to change things up. All in all, it was a fantastic experience, and we will be staying at the Driftwood again on our next visit to Kenya.

We bought tickets in the morning, and went to the morning and afternoon feedings. We also went on the nightwalk which was only 20 Ringit per person, per hour. The nightwalk was amazing! our guide had very good eyes, and spotted many animals and insects around the forest. We adopted an Orangutan, and had an overall very good experience here.

Loved every minute!”|review_142354225|My girlfriend and I went to Sabah for about 12 days at the end of sept/beginning of october. We made many plans in advance, and all the representatives we came in contact with this company went above and beyond to make our trip special. Magdelaine was our contact. She was very quick to respond, very thoughtful, and helped me to organize a birthday cake for my girlfriend on our overnight trip to turtle island... free of charge. Diving in KK was utterly fantastic, and the memories we took from our trip will never be forgotten. The service and professionalism that Dive Down Below provided was a breath of fresh air for this well-travelled couple. I have absolutely no complaints and would be happy to recommend them to ANYONE planning to go to Sabah (I already have). We took our open water divers course and Richard was always around and visible to the guests and more than happy to answer any and every question we had for him. We definately plan to go back and continue our diving experiences! The dive shop located at Times Square was very nice and they helped us to purchase our first pieces of dive equipment ie. mask, snorkels, booties, fins. Overall, this is the kind of company you can trust with your friends and loved ones on holiday. We did, and can't wait to go back :)

Not sure where those people stayed because it couldn't have been here! From the time they picked us up from the airport to the time they dropped us off, our stay was fantastic! Extremely friendly and accommodating, great food for the price, especially being in the jungle! Basic but clean and comfy rooms, great location to do the things you want to do around sepilok. Our plans got changed and we had to check in the following morning instead of the previous night. We said we would be happy to pay for the night so we could check in early the next morning. Upon checkout, they informed us that they didnt charge us for the first night! Bonus! We absolutely enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place to everyone. Just remember this is the middle of the rainforest, not a 5-star luxury beach resort!

Wasn't too impressed with the maps and directions, but well worth the trip and for 10 ringgits, you can't complain!! Saw a monkey and a few birds and interesting bugs, but just to be surrounded by new and beautiful plants was the best part. The flower garden was fantastic too.

Hugo was top-notch, he made our special night perfect. Food was amazing and lived up to every expectation. I have lived in China for 5 years and this is hands down one of the best restaurants I have visited. Not a cheap place by any means, but worth every penny.

We initially swam with a younger dolphin that didn't want to cooperate very well, so the staff member took us to the next pen with two older dolphins who were excellent. The power of these animals was amazing and the experience is one I'll never forget. I do feel that dolphins should be in the wild, but caring for rescued dolphins makes me feel better. Also, the statues and carvings in the gift shop were VERY reasonably priced. Great day!

Swimming Pool is in front of the hotel, meaning guests will need to walk out of the hotel building, cross a small driveway before they can access the pool. Very weird design. Room is quite decent, big with a sofa. But the toilet is poorly designed, tend to flood when we bathed using the showerhead. In the end, we got to stand in the bathtub to bathe to minimise the "flooding." Toilet paper placed too low, will tend to get wet if the paper touch the wet floor. Location near to the airport, quite convenient since we have a driver during our stay. Overall still a pleasant stay.

Love to soak in their hot pool, located on level 55 of tower 2. For people who enjoy working out at gym, enjoy the view while sweating it out. Nowadays the hotel is strict when it comes to the infinity pool. one must have an access card to access the pool area. good for hotel guests but not so for visitors.Food is expensive as expected. But you can always take the MRT to other stations to have your food. Else, we normally settle for Ding Tai Fung which is a 8-10 mins walk from the hotel towers.Guests pay $12 carpark charges for 24 hours valet parking with unlimited entry and exit.

Got our rooms only at 4pm. Can see that staff at registration counter were stressed, having to double up as service staff at the restaurant during breakfast. Dirty sofa near the swimming pool area, dirty towels were not collected and left on the sun tanning chairs.Pros: Location is very good, right next to Paragon. Complimentary carpark for guest.

Stayed there for 3 nights last weekend. For the first two days we have newspapers delivered while the third day, we have nothing. Then we rec'd a call at 11am, reminding us to check out at 12pm sharp as no extension is allowed. We felt unwelcomed as if the hotel can't wait for us to leave.The 3 lifts are a super let down. Imagine wasting 15 mins every morning to reach lobby. All the lifts are full and could not handle the crowd at all. At level 7, we have to take the lift upstairs to 28th top floor and slowly come down level by level to the lobby. A great location but a disappointing stay all in all. The small pool is not worth making our swimming attire wet. The hotel is getting old too.

SMRT is very helpful in travelling around Singapore.. they have different MRT and LRT lines that are connected to one another just like the Englands Underground. My only comment is that some stations especially those with connecting stops like the Chinatown, it is very confusing. if your a first time tourist you have to really follow the arrows where some times leads to a dead end. Plus point to SMRT vs The Tube ok England is SMRT Stations have Lifts making it easy for those with small kids and disabled.

Now it is boring lonely and smelly visit ..the photos of the snakes and eagles was free before but now photo with pay.

I will not make a review on their service, I want to give my view on the foods. At first I did not get theor point of their name not until they serve the plates which are banana leaf. I liked that concept and it gives me the feel of dinning in a tropical place. About their food, it took me back to thailand. I mean their food selection is very asian and I liked that. The price, your in Makati so its reasonable. You will experience here the thai food and other asian food. I like that they don't serve cheap quality food. You can taste the coconut milk on the coconut soup, the chili's on others. I want to dine here again one time :)

They even tricked us by telling us that their bulalo is already good for 4-5 persons and it comes with rice pricing 500. So we thought that its okay to try. We take the table at the 2nd floor overlooking the view of taal volcano. They offer free coffee but that coffee is not what I am expecting. Though it was in a paper cup but all I tasted was paper . When we knew that the bulalo is too expensive we just ordered the grilled liempo, mixed seafoods and chopsuey. Very Not Good! The first thing I get is the carrots from the chopsuey and its very hard. I can't even cut it and it flew out of my plate! I was to feed it to my baby! Then the mixed seafoods, the mussels are thin, not fresh, with hairs, and sticking to its shells. And the Liempo! it was very hard!

My usual meal is the quarter chicken with calamari or prawns (peri peri), or the seafood platter for one. The meals are generous and always delicious. The ambiance in the restaurant is nice, however, no play area means my kids usually are not keen coming to the restaurant, but, I think the other reason it's so popular, is that it's mostly for couples and business meetings. Love the place and the DELICIOUS FOOD. Thank you for the dining experience.

Room service was efficient and the food was good. Spent an entire day at the Valley of the waves, which was a real treat for the kids. Game drives and the predator Park were also just outside the resort. The predator Park was awesome, showing you all of Africa's cats - big and small. Our trip of 3 nights was an amazing time.

Rooms open onto a communal balcony, which was great seeing we travelled with friends who stayed in the room next to us. In room dining was great, really quick. Good view of the mountains but not as great as cathedral peak hotel. Breakfast and supper buffet was very good, but once again the variety was limited as compared to our visit to Cathedral Peak hotel. The dining area was beautiful, and staff were excellent. The hotel is a great retreat and one that I would recommend as it certainly was a perfect weeknd out with the kids who enjoyed the open space and pool. Massages at the pool side was on offer but Didnt manage to book. Pool side bar was great, with staff being extremely polite and helpful. Great weeknd out!

The rooms are nice, comfortable beds, very clean, and decent shower facilities. The staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast in the morning consists of juices and cereal. Sufficient I guess, but make sure you there early during peak season. Overall, the hotel offered great value for money and I would recommend it to others.

Also shower has no bodywash or shampoo so make sure you bring or buy your own. Really I didnt get a good sleep since there was a person in our room who snored loudly and If that bothers you too then maybe its not a good idea to share a room with a bunch of strangers.

It lasted only for few minutes so didnt bother to complain. Clean room and friendly staff. Hotel is just walking distance from the bus stop if you are taking airport express bus from Glasgow airport.

They were kind enough to provide a fan to help me sleep since it was warm during my visit- no AC. Room was clean. Continental breakfast was ok with breakfast staff not saying good morning and wont even look at you. When asked for a coffee the lady just slammed the cup on the table without saying anything then went into the other room with the rest of the staff speaking in their own language. After that morning I decided to have breakfast outside the hotel at a nearby restaurant instead.

The sales lady from a korean shop handed me a shirt from a stack. I didn't bother checking it because its still sealed in a plastic so I thought it was brand new. When I got to the hotel I was surprised to see that the blouse is dirty (with mud) and has blue pen marks that you cant see when its folded. I got the shirt for 5 SIN so didn't bother returning it back for an exchange.

We went there on a Friday and there was a huge crowd but we still enjoyed it. We got discounted tickets from our uber driver that includes a tram ride ticket. The tram was a life saver because I was travelling with two seniors and a four year old child. Try to beat the crowd at the restaurant by going before or after lunch hour. We came at 9am and left at 4pm. It was a fun day.

We were given rm 208. It was quiet the first night but since we stayed on a weekend and new year holiday it was difficult to sleep on few nights bec of the noise outside mostly from cars and people chatting outside. Breakfast is just toast, coffee and cereal same everyday. Overall the hotel is ok, friendly staff and clean.

New coffee maker and I love the idea that there's an Ipod/Iphone dock on the bedside table. Front desk staff are friendly and Concierge are quick and helpful. We tried the self park underground on our first night. $24 for 24 hours but with no in and out privilege. From underground, it's very challenging to find your way to the hotel lobby. It's like walking to a maze while carrying luggage with you. We used the valet parking for the rest of our stay for $32 plus tax for 24 hours. Much more convenient and quick. Will definitely stay here again.

Few of my friends had actually tried other next door water theme park previously. I cannot attest to this but I heard stories that rides in Wild Wadi are more challenging and fun, not sure though.

We went there on a weekend and the weather was quite chilly and windy. The glass floor was awesome not for the faint- hearted though. The outdoor observation was closed due to strong winds and because of this we only have the indoor obsevation deck and can only see the west part of Toronto. The east part of the floor was occupied by a restaurant. You can see more at the upper floors but I believed you have to pay more. I might visit CN tower again but this time I want to dine at their rotating restaurant.

I flew from overseas and decided not to take their airport shuttle service since price for their transpo is kinda high. Took a taxi from the airport to the hotel and paid roughly around 150 Php. I forgot how much the hotel is charging but if Im not mistaken they charge almost double for a shuttle bus. Check in was smooth and glad to know that they are using bag scanners to check through the luggage of the people coming in. People from overseas might find this ackward but thats the way it is for security reasons. When I went into the room the first thing I noticed is the smell of the room, obviously its telling that this place was there for decades. I dont like the smell and the furnishings are outdated like for example the bed and the color of the bath tub which is not white anymore. The towels they used are not new and its not soft. I was surprised that they are using Flat LED Tvs in their hotel rooms. Location wise, this hotel is perfect. Its connected to the Galleria Mall with lots of restaurants and shops. We never ordered food or ate at the hotel as we find it expensive. We always eat breakfast at the mall which opens around 10 in the morning, saves us a lot. From the hotel you can also walk to SM Megamall which is a huge mall and to the train station .

I like the restaurant behind the reception area, they serve good and affordable dishes. The rooms are quite small. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the nearest metro station. The breakfast is just like any ordinary continental breakfast nothing fancy mostly bread and fruits. When we transferred to another IHG property during our stay last January we forgot one of our luggage at the concierge. The bag wasn't labeled and we were able to retrieve it after 3 days. Thanks for their great staff

The rooms are clean however the only thing that I dont like is the location. You have to walk through a long pathway to be able to reach the entrance of the bldg. The area is noisy and the room has no view. Breakfast is ok quite far though located at the rooftop of the main bldg. Not good for those with big built because you have to climb a very narrow staircase to be able to get to the rooftop. I seldom go to Boracay for vacation so when I do I make sure that I'll have a good time. For a more bucks, I would rather stay in a nice place in station 1 with the view of the sea and sand. We decided to stay here for only 1 night and we transferred to a different hotel in Station 1 the next day.

We paid for a room at the back side however the owner was kind enough to transfer us to a room facing the sea and with balcony. We stayed for 4 nights and had saved a lot for our accommodation. The staff are nice providing hot water to us every morning for coffee. Since this is a hassle free accommodation they don't provide room service but no problem with food you can always find your way out to the nearest restaurant. I would say that I will still stay at this hotel for my next stay.
Ms_Michaela|DFC854D54681FC0978F8770BEE4B1C9D|Hotel|Dubai: Crowne Plaza Dubai|3| “Great location”|review_118466326|The hotel is right in the middle of the business district with lots of restaurants/ fast foods in the area. I like the idea that is it near to the train station as well. You can see few chinese prostitutes around the area, just outside of the hotel. We also took their free shuttle bus to Emirates Mall. On the other hand, I agree that the rooms are quite old and hotel needs renovation. We had buffet breakfast at Al Dana restaurant. Food is good however the look of the restaurant is outdated. Its an old hotel but I've noticed that they are still getting lots of business most probably because of location.

You would always needs a taxi to get to the hotel or you can take the train and walk around 5 mins which is not a good idea with the country's scorching heat during daytime . The pool on the roof top is quite small.

One call, and transport was arranged for us from N'eliya town within minutes. The tuk guy was really sweet, perfectly fitting with the Warwick hospitality we have come to know and love.It was like going back home, as Saman and Vijee (the two "main men" of the place) were there to greet us as the tuk stopped, and remembered the circumstances under which we visited the previous time. Felt like going home.The property was beautiful as always. Although a family was occupying 3/5 rooms at the property, they were friendly, courteous, and allowed us our own space. The room was nice and airy, washroom was massive and had a bath tub as well. The food was wonderful as always. It is the true embodiment of Sri Lankan hospitality, as evident by the inquiry whether I did not finish my soup because it was not tasty (it was actually because I was trying leave space for the mains!).We did go for a gorgeous morning walk on the hills that surrounds the property and came back for a hearty breakfast. A good place to chill, relax, and be pampered!

There are interesting artifacts here from the history of maritime trade, as well as many species of aquatic animals. You must see the shipwreck show at the museum. It is something simple but wonderful, that even kids can enjoy it. We spent quite some time sitting in front of the giant tube of sea creatures just watching the manta rays swim. There are feeding times and show times up on their website, so you can time your visit accordingly.

From the Kingdom Far Far Away for the little kids to Sci Fi section for adults (who are kids at heart), everyone can enjoy something here. You would need at least one full day to fully appreciate everything. The food is more expensive than outside, which is natural in a theme park. It was interesting how different restaurants had a menu that catered to the theme. If you are South Asian and looking for rice, Ancient Egypt is your best bet.Make sure you pick up a map from the entrance, and travel in an anti-clockwise manner. Remember to bring a lot of water, and prepare to walk A LOT.It would save you plenty of time if you purchase the express tickets. Yes, they are more expensive than the regular ones. But definitely worth it, considering how the queues can last over three hours.

We had a la carte for dinner, and the food was warm and tasty, but nothing out of this world. The presentation was good, and the service was good as well. For breakfast, we had the buffet. While the food was average, again no WOW factor, the spread was rather small compared to other Jetwing Properties. There were a few action stations for the meat, and that was it. However, for the price, it was okay.We were seated right at the edge of the pavillion, as close as you could get to the Lagoon. As it was a Full Moon day, the dinner had a dreaminess to it with the moon light filtering in through the giant tree, and casting a gleam on the still water of the lagoon. Very poetic. Important. Do not leave your food unattended during day time, even if you are going back to the buffet table for a bun. The crows will take over the second you are out of sight.

It is a small villa with only three rooms. We stayed in the Master Bedroom, which meant that we got the entire top floor to ourselves. There is a nice plunge pool that opens up to the beach, and the beach is only a few meters away. The room was large and spacious. My favourite was the washroom, which was large and airy. It came with a hot tub as well. The downside of the property is that you can't use the kitchen unless you have reserved the entire villa. As there are no restaurants in the area, you have no option but to order in from Jetwing Lagoon, or go there for your meals. In addition, the rooms do not have a view at all. The view in the photos is from the pool area of the Master bedroom.All in all, it was a great place to seek some R&R. It would be a great place to visit with a bunch of friends, if you can reserve the entire villa.

Food can be better.”|review_445011750|This hotel seems to be very popular among locals and foreigners. The location is beautiful, although the drive there can be tricky if two vehicles need to cross. The renovation has been done beautifully, that the inside looks like that of a toy factory. As we visited during December, the smell of pine and the mist encircling the place made it look very Chrsitmas-y. The rooms are of average size, beds comfortable and nice. It was nice to find a bowl of strawberries with cream waiting for us upon entering the room. The washroom is clean. The shower and the bathtub are together, which was bit of a nuisance.The only complaint regarding the room is that the ceiling was too thin. We were kept awake by the trampling of whoever was in the room above us.The service is excellent. Staff is attentive without being annoying. The food, though, was among the worse I have had in any hotel here. All in all, it was a pleasant stay.

The highlight of the place was the service/staff, though. They were the true embodiment of famous Sri Lankan hospitality. There are trails to walk around the property, as well as a pleasant garden that is ideal for reading or playing a board game. There is no wifi, tv in the rooms, and sometimes no signal at all.

There is a paddy field, a little stream, forest-like area and amazing mountains surrounding the place. The food was really good, and the people were nice too. There is a tree house that they rent out as well. There is hot water, and as it is in tune with nature, you might find night-time visitors such as frogs in the shower. The rooms are clean and simple.

Loved the open space plan and the different tiers on which the hotel was built. Service was good, present but not overly attentive and allows you privacy. The view and the location is simply amazing.

The building holds so much character, that is an experience in itself to explore the hotel. The fireplaces with dancing flames at night (they are lit during the day as well during colder times) is perfect for a read. The room was crisp, clean, with all the necessities. Bed was comfortable, and the lighting was just right. The washroom was a bit too small for my taste, but very clean and crisp.The staff is extremely friendly, nice and helpful. Food is delicious too.

Amazing location, right on the banks of Gregory lake. The restaurant has an outdoor seating area, which gives you an amazing view while dining. The reception is located in the restaurant, though, which was a little weird. There are eight chalets in total.Chalet: We were at the furthermost chalet, and enjoyed a corner to ourselves. The bed was comfortable. The setting was nice. But the floorboards creaked with every step, and we were in perpetual fear that the floor would break. The tea cups provided were stained. The washroom, while spacious, had a dead cockroach in the bathtub, which must have been there for at least a couple of days, because there was a stain. Water pressure varies drastically. Hot water is a bit difficult to control. But the view from the chalet, almost makes up for it all.

There were stains on the material of the roof, but it wasn't too bad. The bed was comfortable, spacious enough, and the washroom had cobble floors which was pretty neat as there was no way it could get dirty. There were several power interruptions throughout our stay, which was a little scary because the huts are located a little apart from each other, and there is no light or sound.The food was delicious, vegetables and fruits plucked from their gardens itself. The service was wonderful, all smiles and help and amazing.

We had a room on the third floor. The room was on the smaller side, but completely clean and nice - but the washroom was tiny! There are no taps apart from the wash basin (forget trying to clean only your legs after a walk on the beach), and the toilet is separated from the shower area by a thin curtain. Expect to smack your hands at every turn trying to take a shower, and perpetually wet floors. The safety locker in our room did not work, but we made no fuss about it as we were more than happy to take care of our valuables without it.The average. The beach experience is average, as one cannot wade into the sea portion right in front of the hotel. The view is average (for a Sri Lankan who is accustomed to seeing the sea on a daily basis). Cannot comment about the pool as we did not use it. The TV is rather small, the two chairs in the room are nice to look at, but not too comfortable to sit in. The good/great. The service here is simply brilliant! Everyone is helpful and full of smiles- only too ready to oblige! Worth a visit simply for the amazing service, as these people are the famous hospitable Sri Lankans books are written on. The food was really nice as well. The choices were rather limited, but they tasted really great!All in all, great place if you are looking for a nice place to stay while surfing/snorkeling. Great food, great people and average rooms.

Love the fact how the staff is ready to help, be it with choosing which to order or snapping a pic of you and your friends having a great time. The food is decent, (crepes are good!) and quite reasonably priced. As I am one who looks more for the aroma of the place, Cioconat is always my number one choice, especially when all I want to do is have a good heart-to-heart while nibbling on something sweet.

Overall nothing much has changed from my Last review.Just to update... that the restaurants do not serve alcohol drinks anymore. The reason : Owing to the Supreme Court directive, the sale of alcohol will not be permitted within 500 metres of highways in the country as in force from April 1, 2017.for some reasons the small road in front of the hotel is considered to be a highway.Hotel management is fighting to resolve this issue, but it may take a while.If drinks are a priority on you stay list, you may consider staying elsewhere away from so called assumed highways.

Nothing particular review as a good experience. The economy seats are cramped. Air staff hospitality is average.The reason of picking up this airline for my travel was because it was the only non-stop flight for the days when i wanted to travel.From Mumbai there is no other option ( Non stop) but to use Air Mauritius. I believe they have partnered with Air India. So if you book Air India, you may end up with Air Mauritius. Holiday goers may consider taking a day or 2 in Dubai and flying on Emirates Airline‎.Nothing Great, nor was anything that was a bad experience. An Average flight experience!

Hotel is by the beach, and the hotel property is huge.The Hotel is a bit away from the flic and flac market and to walk down is not possible. Hotel taxi are expensive. You Could opt for other Mauritius Taxi ( check the web) who have a slightly better rate than the hotel taxis. The meals at hotels are expensive. There are reasonable eat outs at the flic and flac market.Overall a good stay. Would recommend the ground floor rooms with direct access to the garden and beach.Over all Staff is Good. Cons:Bathing Room and Toilets are seperate which is irritating.I had some ants visiting the room on the first day. This was sorted out after informing the hotel staff.One word of Caution.."Keep you personal belongings Locked in the locker."Cant really point out for sure..., but i had my Gold Ring missing. In the holiday mood, not sure if i lost it at the hotel or elsewhere. Incidentally my Locker was not closed that day in my room.

I wanted to give my baby some porridge but is was not even warm! Plenty of shopping and many activities around, a resort that has many choices under one roof!Tips: From the hotel lobby main entrance, turn right and down the escalator it will take you to the theme park.

They called me back and said that they couldn't find it but our passports was left in the safe. We went back and told the reception that we are here for the collection. The lady name starting with Anra or Nara was very impatience to entertain us. Pulling a long face at us and went to asked her manager. After 30 minutes of pressuring them for my baby stuff, we finally got back our passports and the blanket. Service was pretty bad! Paying $300 over in SGD per night and with the long drive up and receiving such unhelpful services is definitely not worth it!

Our room if I remember correctly is 1715. The moment we entered the room it was filled with cigarette smell! It was really unbearable! We chosen this hotel due to its location and seriously regretted. There is a new hotel right beside, I will take that instead of this hotel again. Check in was super slow as they were so 'busy' until they have forgotten that we are waiting for our room which they mention it will be done in 10 minutes. Lift was slow, pool was icy cold, breakfast place was like a battle! Food ran out fast and the refilled took quite a long time and the food wasn't nice at all!Location:Next to BCS mall, a nice place to shopA2 foodcourt is right behind, cheap & nice seafood foodcourtRoom:Very spacious but given the size there is no bathtub'Oily' floorBad cigarette smellCigarette stain and marks on table and bedDirty bedsheetFurniture was run down and my poor toddler got a splinter from it!Kettle was dirty and stained.

We are missing the lions as they have a notice saying that this lions are new and hiding if we can't see them. There is some renovation going on, I guess is preparing for the Koala's to be officially open on 20th May. Is was a clean and nice place to visit but sometimes you might get lost if you going on foot.I brought my toddler to the Kidzworld for water play, I felt is good to have guards at the water play so to keep a lookout for the kids and also inform us when the rain is coming. There is hot shower provided in the bath area which was a good choice. But there is a few things which I felt was missing out.- If the fan in the toilet/bath area can be switch off manually will be good because been a parent I don't really like drying my kids under the fan especially in the open area and when there is rain- There is only 2 shower cubicle in the ladies area which we waited quite awhile for our turn. And with a little toddler who is wet, is it not very ideally in my own opinion and what if there is a huge crowds on the weekend?- It was raining heavy yesterday and we were all stuck in the bath area. With a toddler, bags and stroller is not possible for me to dash through the rain to the restaurant but if there is a covered walkway from the bath area to the restaurant that will be goodNerveless, this place was fun and a great place for the children's to spend their day. Remember to prepare mosquito repellent!

We are 2 adults with 1 toddler (15 months) and 1 older child and we took corner suite room. We are totally lost on the 1st day when we are trying to find our ways to the hotel. After reading the reviews here we actually found a better and shorter way to the hotel.1. Exit Hoehyeon Station exit 52. You should see a optical and pet shop in front of you when you exit 5 (namdaemun market)3. When you see the main road on your left next to the local food store, turn right4. Walk along that stretch where you should see a market store on your right and accessories shop as you go5. You should pass by a overhead bridge and 'Seven Luck Casino' should be on your left6. In total is only about 10mins walk from Namdaemun MarketPlease take note that they do not have Baby Cot despite calling themselves a 4-star hotel.Corner Suite room- Spacious- Enough storage space for us to keep our stuff- Nice toilet bowl lol- Comfortable beds- Clean- Poor wifiThere is alot of restaurants at the back alley. The noodle store in front of the hotel sell very nice noodle soup, perfect for cold weather. Location stands out, staff is helpful, 10mins walk to Lotte Mart and Seoul Station (turn right from hotel entrance). You can cross the road directly to go Lotte Mall if you worry about the 'smell' at the underpass which has no issue for us.

Booked a deluxe room and here my review:Deluxe room, agoda stated 2 double beds but is 1 double bed and 1 single.Location: GoodOut of the hotel, turn right and head straight you can get to Times Square. Or turn right and right again you can go to Pavillon shopping mall. Room (1515): AverageHot water shower takes at least 15min to heat up! Call maintenance twice and he only say, no choice, just have to wait! Nothing was done at all. FYI, When you are travelling with a little baby, everything matters!The single bed is slanted, so funny!Wifi: Sometimes you get connection sometimes not. So good luck!Toiletries: 1st time staying in a hotel where toothbrush is not provided. Service: Disappointing! Unfriendly and not very helpful! 1st: Check in was super slow even there is 4 staffs at the counter. Room was not ready when I came at 12.30pm and was told to wait till 2pm. 2nd: Back at 3pm, the lady say she has to check if our room are ready. Took another 20min to get our room!3rd: I never expect to see such thing to happen at a hotel and right in front of the guests! The lady who is helping on our reservation went to her colleague for help on our room availability. Instead of receiving help, her colleague brush her off, showing an annoying face and told her she was busy and ask her to get others to help. My opinion: Be more professional in handling matters.Breakfast: Got japan, indian, local and chinese food. If anyone require a simple taxi service to Genting or KL aiport can pm me. I have a contact for a nice taxi driver which can pick up max 4 pax :)

I love the cooling temperature! Miss my holiday!If I did not remember wrongly, my 2 bedrooms standard is on 2nd level, 1st unit on the left after exit from the lift. Should be number 6 and if you are renting a car you will park accordingly to your apartment number. My friend is at level 6 unit 19 and the worse and unlucky friend got a unit at level 5, the centre unit which I forgot the number.2 bedrooms standardLikesSpaciousCleanQuietDislikesCupboard are run downKitchen cabinet can't be close wellOven is dirty which I dare not useWasher knob is spoilt which make it hard to turnWasher will stop in between and you got to watch it all time if you need to do washingThere is a wooden safe box inside a bedroom cupboard cover with webs which freak me out!Please note that the bathtub has no stopper and the shower head is attached to the walls which is not removable! This makes it hard for me to shower my baby who is 9 months old. My friend is stay at level 6, 1 bedroom standard is way better than mine. Kitchen seems to be renovated unlike the one I stay. The one at level 5 was worse, the sofa was cover with white dust and the whole place was very dirty.Overall is a experience for me which I won't return. Liz is very helpful, friendly and nice but the apartment really needs some makeover.

I should have stick to Cottage Spices where I won't even hit $100 for 8 dishes with drinks!Food is average, fried chicken is saltish and fishball soup taste like those in food centre! Chincalok omelette is fragrant, portion is small and overall the price is too expensive! Good lesson paid, first and the last time!

Reason for choosing them is because premium room has a day bed which converted from a balcony and my elder one can sleep there. Location and their safe carpark.Sad to say that this hotel is loosing its charm. Room is indeed huge and spacious, comfortable bed but the furniture is wearing off. Request for baby cot and they provide me a playpen with mattress with baby pillow and 2 cute bolster. It wasn't comfortable as the centre part of the mattress actually sink down. I saw strand of hair at the toilet bowl seat and yellow mucky water not flush clean, gross! Bath tub has a tiny dead insect in it and the button of the toilet bowl has algae around it.I pay $370RM for this room and no breakfast! Too expensive which I felt not worth it. This will be the last time, I still prefer the hotel next to them.

By the wa,y this time round I engage Mr Kom as our driver to pick and send us to airport and also our day trip. He has really good and afforable day tour and his respond through email was very fast! He can even speak quite good english and he was caring as well because he drop me a text me on the day we went Phi Phi to check if we are back safe.Rayaburi hotel, staff was very thoughtful to arrange the decoration to welcome us. Room (deluxe room with balcony)Like:Balcony for us to dry our swim wear but sadly only a corner of it as the other side will get wet if it rainsCleanA Safe for you to lock your personal stuffStaff was helpful & friendlyNear to the beachHave a few good massage place next to hotel20 minutes walk to jungceylon (it can be quite tiring walking there & back to hotel)Dislikes:Room was noisy during the night as the room was facing the pub across the roadBathtub was too high(I am pregnant so is quite a hassle for me to climb in and out), unlike the superior room they have a standing shower & bathtubBed was very hard Breakfast - so-so, some dishes are nice that I don't mind having it againBreakfast area has unwanted guests (files)If you don't throw your towel on the floor they won't change a new one for youOverall is a cheap hotel stay that I would consider for a return for our next trip :)

We stay there on 15th March, upon arrival at the ferry terminal you could easily spot the free transport which can bring you to Holiday Inn. Weather was very good during the days we were there especially during the night is was super cooling, temp at around 17d.Hotel was huge but they have connecting hotel so don't get lost when you take the lift back to your room. After we went to our room, someone called my husband to asked what time can they come to decorate the room? How funny is that? Aren't they suppose to do it before we check in?Another joke, when they send us the cake to our room which was suppose to be 'happy Anniversary' or maybe 'Happy Honeymoon' but it was Happy Birthday! So I thought they are so meticulous knowing that my husband birthday is 3 days away and they send in the cake. No, I was wrong the guy came back and said he deliver the wrong cake! Oh my!Location wise, I would said depends. Macau is divided into 2 so if you are a person who prefer town area with easy access to most of the things than this won't be the place you are looking for. It was surrounded by big hotels with difficulties finding food and even convenience store. If you need to go to Senado Square go to City of Dreams to catch the free shuttle bus (start at 11am) the journey is about 20mins.Holiday Inn only provided buses to Ferry or to the Border if you plan to go Zhuhai which is another great place to shop. Another thing to note is that there is a lot of 'chickens' hanging around the hotel during the night time which make me feel very sleezy.If you willing to explore and walked, go through Venetian hotel and cross the bridge to Taipa Village. Thou small but they have very nice portuguese food :) Room: Spacious and cozyBed is supa comfortableClean Bathroom:Spacious with standing shower and bathtubCleanFull toiletries supplied

But this time round I decide to try Hatten as it is newly build. The carpark was not located in the hotel basement but next to it at Hatten Square Mall. You got to park your car and take a lift down to the gound floor and walked to your left side to the entrance of the hotel. Lobby was huge and I read the review saying that checking in will be packed and crowded but we never encounter any. Checking in time was 2pm but we manage to get our rooms before that. As usual, staff at the reception wasn't friendly and helpful at all!All their rooms are called 'Suite' but it don't look like to me, just an additional sofa with extra TV in the room and the price we paid for has no bathtub! Room was clean, bed was comfortable but the toilet bowl has some black stain which seems like it can't be remove. The worse was the airconditional which wasn't working and than we get to know it apply to the whole 19th level. Swimming pool was icy cold even on hot weather and the hotel have steam bath in the toilet next to the pool which we enjoy most. Breakfast was pretty good too, lots of variety but be early if not you got to join in the battles with the crowds. Hotel location was very good, Hatten mall has nothing much which you can skip but the best thing was it is connected to another mall and you won't need to worry if it rains. Overall is a nice stay, hopefully their price will be remind and I will return for my next visit.

On the day before my departure there was a system error at the airport and I was worry that my flight will be delay so I quickly send the hotel a email to inform them. I never expect to get their reply within mintues, really thankful for their service towards us.The driver was still there at the airport waiting for us even we were 1 hour late and the journey to the hotel was actually 15min but due to the bad traffic it took more than 30min. The hotel looked like their local bunglow really feel homely like what others said. And their staff can speak good english and they do have driver which you can request if you wish to go to volcano land or the hot spring for 550K rupiah. My advice is book a driver to drive you around in Bandung if you are not familar as it is not easy to grab a cab.We booked Premier King room and is located at the ground floor next to their restaurant.Pros:Big cozy room with comfortable king sized bedAdditional sofa bed which my husband can use as I have a daughter sharing bed with me2 LCD TVVery spaciousSeparate bathtub and standing showerCons:Mosquito kisses during night timeBreakfast was almost the same daily with limited varietyCupboard looks like is going to break apart at anytimePoor TV channel no kids channelRoom are dusty as I got sinus whenever I return to my roomThou walking distance to Istana Mall but try not to walk during night time as the road are dark and very unsafe. Is quite near to Paris Van Jaya if you are able to walk there but not very near to other factory outlet. Thumbs up to their service, I called them after I leave Trans studio as I have a hard time getting a cab and they manage to arrange for us. Their service towards their customer is never fail they will try their best to help whenever they can.
vandylim|4A6FAA4FC6B96054CA1658F7F66C09B8|Attractions|Bandung: Trans Studio Bandung|2| “Not mean for tourist!!”|review_145786531|Was there on 10th Nov (Sat) we reach there around 2.pm Indo time. Before I came here I read up alot of reviews do alot of research and my main purpose is to bring my daughter here to play and enjoy but it turn out to be a very disappointing trip. When we reach at the ticketing counter I was seriously surprise because there is totally no queue but we still went ahead to get the VIP ticket which cost 400,000 rupiah as I read from the reviews stating that weekend are very crowded. We had a hard time communicating with them is like a having 2 different kinds of animal communicating. They can't really speak basic English thou my husband know a little of their language but is still very hard to talk to them. When we enter the theme park I totally regretted buying VIP ticket there was no crowd! Unlike the review and the blog I went to read it was totally opposite!! And to those who want to grab some food my advice is have it before you enter the theme park. There is food junction outside the theme park at the same level and even A&W. If I knew earlier I won't eat their pathetic fried chicken meal! After filling our stomach we went to walk around and the only thing my 8 years old girl can enjoy is the dragon ride, the indoor playground, the water ride and the car ride that all! The rest require at least 135cm and I doubt a 9 years old child would dare for their scary rides which is like 5 level that high. Another thing is their map only comes in Malay and no English language and same goes to all their shows.One thing about VIP is like a 'short cut' to the rides with many people stares at you but the bad of having VIP ticket is you might not even get the chance of enjoying that short cut at times. We went for the water rides using our VIP, end up we got to squeeze into other people queue and that is their so called VIP? Horrible!! Genting theme park is way better than here, I personally feel that their theme park is only meant for their local people and not tourist like us.Don't waste your time coming here if you can't communicate with them.

Took a train from the airport to Payathai station which is cheaper than getting a cab directly from the aiport to hotel. And from there we took a cab to the hotel and majority of the cabby doesn't know where Myhotel is located so make sure you got the hotel map ready. Taxi fare was cheap it cost us only 45baht but the taxi was bargaining with us for a 100baht so you got to be careful of this.Hotel was located at a back alley and down the alley was a factory and it can be quite dangerous for female travellers like us during the night. Walk all the way out about 10mins you will reach Pratunam area which you will get to see their IT mall across the street and another 5mins down you will reach Platinum mall. They do provide free free tuk tuk service which they send it will send you to Plantinum mall but the fact is they only send you out to the main road and you have to cross over to the mall yourself but there is no exact location to pick you back to the hotel. Shortcut: When you step out of the hotel turn left and walk up to the cross junction you will see White Palace on your left, walk all the way up you will reach Pratunam market and it link all the walk to Baiyoke sky. Morning and night they have different types of street market over here. Room was small with 2 single beds. Tv channel was bad, bathroom with standing shower and not enough rack to hang 2 towels. The funny thing was the basin was outside the bathroom. Pillow and bedsheet has some stain on it and the worse is the aircon was dripping and I can hear the noise at night which is quite irritating. Their corridor are quite cramp and very near to another room so it can be quite noisy as well if you have an inconsiderate neighbour.We book the hotel through their website and they mention that the promotion we took up has free wifi, foot massage, set dinner and breakfast for 999baht per night which is pretty worth it but after we check it we felt cheated. Wifi only for a day, foot massage only 30min for 1 person and the set dinner for 1 person as well and the room we book is for 2 person. Please check carefully before you book through their website.I would rather pay a little more and stay elsewhere and definitely won't recommend this place.

And oyster omelette, asparagus, BBQ butter prawn, deep fried squid, steam stingray with white rice.

Ferry was nearly 2hours to reach and a 45min car ride to reach the resort. We realize the whole resort has no lift so you have to climb all the way up to your room. Our room was big and spacious but there was a few power cut due to generator fault.Bathroom comes with standing shower and has a weird smell. Water pressure was very small and the water goes hot and cold can't get the right temperature at all. Jacuzzi is at the balcony it was big enough for 2 adults but it is very dirty no matter how I try to clean it there is still dust in it. And it takes quite some time to fill up the jacuzzi and too bad they don't provide any bubble bath.Breakfast doesn’t have much variety and by the time we went down for breakfast (8am indo time) not much food was left. There are 2 small swimming pools, one located near the lobby one directly outside the cafe. They have some sea sports to play in the morning. Overall is quite a relaxing place to go but we won't go back there again. We still prefer bintan resort or batam which we find is a much better place than here.

But...”|review_57490827|My sister has booked this hotel for us after reading the review on Tripadvisor. Not too bad, room was clean, spacious and nice. The last day of our trip they asked us to paid for the 2nights that we have stay. I was kinda of shocked because my sister said she has already made the full payment but the hotel manager said my sister only paid for the deposit of one night stay. After checking with my sister she said she has already send them the credit card form but the hotel did not make any deduction so I requested the manager to do a check again. And later I get to know why they did not receive the form is because they did not check their email whether the form has been send to them or not. Another thing, my sister has requested them to decorate the room for us which they did not and I only get to know when I am back home as it is meant to be a suprise for us. I do have a pleasant stay with this hotel but their service wise need some improvement. Communicating with them is also kinda of difficult.

The room is the same as what you see on their website. The rooms are very spacious, comfortable beds, wooden floor and clean bathroom. The only troublesome thing is they don't seems to have a main switch to off all the lights in the room so I have to go around to off it.Breakfast has alot of variety. Try to go early as it start to get really crowded around 9am. Security is good as they need card access in the lift to go to your room and also at the corridor just before you head to your room.Location is quite good 10min walk to KLCC or a 10min walk to their clubbing street.I will choose this hotel again for my next stay.

Check in was smooth, service was pleasant. I stay at room 310 the moment I step inside I check out the bathroom first. It was small, the ceiling paint was flaking, the bathtub has some yellow stain and worst of all the shower head drop on my friend feet while she was bathing. And we have a visitor on our last night. A huge cockroach was in the basin and we have to get the housekeeping guy to remove it. The bed was as hard as wood, the pillow was as thin as the sheet. And thanks to the bed me n my friend had backache every morning when we woke up. We feel itchy when we are resting on the bed I believe the sheet is not properly clean.The lights are filled with dust and not there isn't much program on the tv. Cupboard was faulty n dirty, no safe and no dryer.I realize most cab n tuk tuk doesn't know where is Bangkok City Inn so if you are staying there do bring a map with you at all time. Breakfast was normal not much of the variety. I regret choosing this hotel and I will never come back here again. With a few dollars more I could stay at a much cleaner and pleasant hotel than Bangkok City Inn.

Speaking of the shop, they have a merchandise shop where you can buy jams, honey, organic ice cream, and other organic products.

Location-wise, it's good because it's near the seaport, however the hotel's pretty far from the beach. Especially to the world-famous Panglao beach.

The Mummy - I did not expect this one to be very thrilling! I thought it would just be a boring ride. But jeezus I was blown away! It's like riding a roller coaster in total darkness! Unbelievably fun!2. Battlestar Galactica - This is the resident roller coaster of Universal Studios Singapore. It's a roller coaster with double the fun! This coaster has 2 rides. The concept is on the name itself, Battlestar Galactica. Basically it's like a fight with humans and aliens. One coaster is where you ride as the humans. A basic roller coaster ride. But the other one for me is way more fun: the aliens' side! On this other coaster, your feet are hanging! Imagine that! OMG my soul separated from my body during the first drop! I can't overstate enough how fun that ride was!But my most useful tip is this: buy express passes! Again, BUY EXPRESS PASSES!!! It's the purchase that I never regretted! It will save you a TON of time! Normal tickets will cost you AN HOUR in line waiting for your turn. But when you use express pass, it will literally take you a minute to get to the ride. There's a different line for normal tickets and for express passes. You can see the envy from the eyes of the people who endured long lines waiting. While you just walked in but you get to ride first.

Anyway, my tip for you is to follow the feeding schedule of each animal. You can see the time on the maps provided to you when you buy a ticket. Most of these animals sleep when not feeding, so when they are fed, it's a guarantee you can see them at them grandest.

And damn we were not disappointed. We booked the "Phi Phi-Maya-Khai Island Premium Service". I don't really know how it differs from the other packages, but we were really treated well during the trip. The main tour guide (I forgot his name) spoke good English, he wasn't difficult to understand and our questions were answered satisfactorily. He really knows how to entertain us with humor to not bore us during the hour-long trips per island, and knows when to shut up when the guests are tired from all the activities and wanted to sleep. But some staff on the boat don't seem to know how to speak English so if you have queries just ask the main tour guide. My friend, unfortunately, was really sea-sick early during the tour, but they were kind enough to tend to her needs throughout the day. They even gave her some pills and some sort of healing salve. The boat is filled with a ridiculous amount of bottled water and other beverages so you don't have to worry about dehydration and lack of drinkable water. We were treated a buffet lunch at Ton Sai Bay and an hour siesta to rest on one of the rentable sun lounges. When we woke up and CHECKED OUR WATCHES, it was already beyond the allotted time to stay on that island. We had a mini-heart attack and got super worried that maybe we were already left by our boat. We asked the other tour guides from other boats (note that there are a lot of boats on the islands and they look exactly the same except for the company name painted on the side) if "i-forgot-the-name-of-our-tour-guide"s boat already left, and they pointed me to where our boat is located (all the guides from different companies seem to know each other). And thank good heavens they are still there, but the other tourists with us on that boat were not there yet. And it dawned on us that our watches were not adjusted to the time-zone of Thailand! And we arrived 30mins earlier! We just laughed from our foolishness. But I'm quite sure they will not leave behind one of their guests because 10mins before the departure per island, they look around people with the baller/rubber bracelets (they give it before the tour starts) corresponding to each tour package.Overall, the tour was great thanks to the superb service of the staff of SRC! If I am to go back to Phuket, I will surely book them again.

Walking distance to Bangla road but far enough to avoid the noise of partying. And Patong beach is also on a walking distance. And they have this "happy hour" where in you can play games hosted by the staff, through this you can mingle with other hotel guests from around the world and make new friends!

You can tell because the place really looks ageing. Maybe they don't maintain it very well. But still people go here because of the variety of booze they offer. The place is quite small so the bar gets very crowded during peak hours. I recommend sitting outside. The view is nice and the feel of the sand is nice on your feet because it really is located on the seaside.

The lower floor has tables and seats to dine and drink. It is practically an open bar because there's no wall nor window covering the facade of the building. However, the 2nd floor is a different story. It is a full-time dance floor. It is where you drink and dance. Like a lot of dancing. But it tends to be overcrowded. And the rest room is located there. Meaning, if you're just on the first floor drinking, you have to go upstairs and battle the crowd just to get inside the toilet. They have a a lot of choices for your booze, but a few for your food. And the whole place has loud music! Really loud electronic music. This is not a place merely for dining. This is more of a place where you want to get drunk -- in a posh way.

We made an early reservation beforehand because their dinner buffet tends to get booked a lot. The food was good but not impressive. The steaks though are very good! After a full dinner, the dancing chefs started their nightly ritual of dancing and entertaining the guests and also the people just walking by the restaurant. However I think they are not really chefs. They're just staff of the hotel/restaurant dressed as chefs. Nevertheless, it's fun seeing them dance and also the tourists who joined them it's a mayhem! You can also take pictures with some of them, they will be happy to hold your stuff and take the pictures for you.

We arrived there early in the morning so that we could avoid the crowd. I'd be honest I was really excited to go there because I haven't tried cliff jumping before. But when we arrived there, fear and anxiety met me! However, the excitement was still there. But fear is slowly eating me. We first tried jumping at the lowest point (forgot how many meters) to ease up to the highest point. But even the lowest is still so scary. After a few jumps at the lowest point, we hiked up the hill to the highest one to gauge the distance from the top. AND GOD IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT. It feels like we're from the sky looking from below! We have finally decided we have major acrophobia. Haha. And did I mention the water's extremely cold? But maybe perhaps because we came too early in the morning. And only a couple of tourists can be found there and the locals living there were quite busy with whatever they're doing that no one's encouraging us to jump. There were only a few kids looking and laughing at us thinking how a bunch of sissies we are. So eventually we gave up. And left the island feeling disappointed with ourselves. But if given the chance I will definitely come back there, build up a LOT of courage and jump at Ariel's Point! So my tip to all who are planning to go there PACK UP SOME SERIOUS COURAGE AND LEAVE YOUR ACROPHOBIA AT HOME!

The rooms are quite aged and feel really old. Our bathroom door knob is damaged when we arrived and we had the maintenance fix it while we are unpacking (so awkward). The staff is not nice nor rude. They don't smile at all. They act like they just take their work for granted (esp. the staff in the check-in desk and in the restaurant). The upside of Casa Pilar is the location! The resort is located in Station 3 so it's far enough to avoid the noise from the bars and party places. But near enough the restaurants and activities. G-Max (Reverse Bungee) is just beside the resort! You should try it if you're an adrenaline junkie! They also have an infinity pool (but the beach is not visible so it kind of defeats the purpose of being an infinity pool) which becomes very warm from the sun exposure even in the night. They closes the pool by 10pm but we are stubborn people so we continued dipping even until 1am! Haha. The staff also didn't tell us to leave so we stayed all through the night. And the beach shore (maybe 50 steps away from the resort) is immaculately clean! And you can't resist the white powdery sand and blue water! They also provide sun lounges on the beach side available for use, free of charge, to the booked guests.

First off - the hotel does not have a airport shuttle. Not one taxi new wear it was located, let alone what "Disneyland" was. The only reason why we finally found a taxi to bring us to the hotel was because I was wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt and I pointed to the shirt and said "Mickey mouse" from there we we're brought to the resort by taxi... It was interesting. The hotel however is like you are literally stepping into the movie toy story! It's amazing! Woody and Jesse are there so make sure you meet them. Room: the rooms are perfect and the toothbrush tin is the perfect take away gift. The tv just place Disney movie but when in Rome, do what the Romans do. Lol Food: ... The food is Chinese food. No, not American Chinese food. Like real Chinese food... I personally did not enjoy the food. But the little bakery has cookies and sandwiches so i was five with that. But that's all we could eat at the hotel. (And at Disney in general we legit ate at cheese cake factory everyday) lol Enmities: ok there is no pool and no gym. Instead of the pool they had this pizza planet rocket ship that apparently squirted water out...idk.Any way, there is no gym but the hotel book said that there is a jogging trail around the resort. When I asked the front desk about this they had no idea what I was talking about and when they finally found out what I was talking about the told me "I wouldn't do that, it's unsafe". So instead I ran around the out side of the hotel- from the buzz statue. Around the woodie statue and to the rocket ship, (then repeat) lol it was actually pretty awesome. So no complaints.Transportation: the resort is linked through busses just like Walt Disney world. They're great. My last day I accidentally left my bag on the bus. Within 30 mins of telling the hotel my bag was hand delivered to my room. It was magical. Language: of course you must remember that you are in China and not everyone speaks English, but they do try and they do it with a smile. Also make sure you let them know when it's your birthday, the decorated our room with balloons and presents. It's was amazing! Over all i loved this hotel!

He knew all the best places and at what time it wouldn't be crowded. Some of the pictures he took are the best pictures I have seen: Check out my Instagram@tony.cannoli. He gave me recommendations on what to eat and what to buy, and every time I was never disappointed. Seriously, best tour guide ever!I went alone as a 23 year old male and felt safe the whole time, and I'm glad I went with a tour guid because it was such an amazing experience not only to see the temples but to learn about them as well.5 stars!!!!! -Tony From New Jersey, USA
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Restaurant|Ilford: Enzo's Pizzeria|5| “Great authentic pizza and halal ”|review_466870474|Myself and my husband came here for dinner for the valentines weekend. We saw a YouTube video rating this restaurant very highly.First I must mention that parking is very tight in and around the area, so please bear this in mind, as that is the only con I find. That aside, once at the restaurant we were seated promptly and served menus. Unfortunately I cannot remember the names of the pizza but my husband ordered an enzo special with chicken and spice and I ordered a normal chicken pizza. The food is halal which is great.Once delivered to our table we were not disappointed, the pizzas are exactly like the ones in Rome and Italy overall. They are thin crust with fresh ingredients. The restaurant do not have additional sauces as they make it and cook it like the Italians. And also a great portion for each individual. We also had dessert, the chocolate sponge cake with ice cream to share and that was also lovely.I would highly recommend, it's not a chain and the service feels personal. Would definitely visit again
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Restaurant|Singapore: Alaturka|5| “Good food and beautiful location ”|review_461829717|My husband and I came here for dinner on our last evening in Singapore. We sat outside as it was quite packed inside. Firstly the restaurant is located in Arab town and from Alaturka you can see the main mosque at night (masjid Sultan). It looked absolutely beautiful and peaceful all lit up.The service at Alaturka was very good, we ordered the platter for 2 and honestly it was the right amount of food, it was delicious! Cost wise it was very reasonably priced. I would recommend if you're interested in authentic Turkish food and fancy kebabs, chicken shish etc 
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Johor Bahru: Chinese Heritage Museum|5| “A blast from the past :)”|review_461828193|It was purely by chance that my husband and I came to visit the Chinese heritage museum. We were in Chinatown , sat down for a bite to eat and then noticed it across from us, it literally is in the heart of Chinatown.Upon entering staff were wonderful , tickets were fairly cheap and as it was Chinese New Year coming up and my husband was born in that year he managed to enter for free. ( I would say bring your passport as you never know it could be your year). I however paid but as mentioned it wasn't expensive at all.The museum staff gave us a headphone and video/ tape player with descriptions and information of each of the sections and rooms and you can also read this on the tape player. There were quite a few floors and each section was numbered for ease of getting around. Some of the stories are sad and makes you really think of how life was many many years ago. The rooms are laid out as if we were there and living in those conditions. We could've spent much longer at the museum, as they had a few interactive screens on the last floor but unfortunately were short of time. We managed to see everything and were there for 3hrs but it does depend on your pace.It was well thought of, educational and I would highly recommend visiting .
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Singapore: 1-Altitude Gallery & Bar|5| “Excellent evening with good music and breathtaking views”|review_461825528|My husband and I spent our last night in Singapore at the Altitude bar. We went on a Thursday evening and it was by chance that it was RnB night (which we loved). Getting here is fairly easy and it's not too far from Raffles. Once at the entrance, one must purchase tickets first before entering . Now tickets are slightly steep but they do include one drink, stunning rooftop views, excellent service from all members of staff including the bar staff, waiters and security . So I do think it is well worth the cost.Once in there, there are two sections, the dance floor section and also the rooftop section where you can relax and watch over the views of Singapore whilst sipping over the drink. The dj was really good and played some great music. Dress code I would say is smart casual.Getting a return taxi back is fairly as there is a taxi not too far. Overall I would recommend coming here, you won't be disappointed.
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Skyline Luge Sentosa|5| “Fun activity !”|review_458897430|My husband had been wanting to do this on sentosa island . Initially I was a bit reluctant as I wasn't too sure what to expect at and if it would be like a race track with people flying past me.So my husband went ahead and paid to go on the luge three times at a discounted rate , whereas I paid for the one go as I still wasn't sure. You can pick from two tracks , one is the beach track which is longer but not as bendy and twisty and the other is the rainforest track which my husband also tried out and said it is a little shorter but bendier. The activity itself is so much fun and you can go at your own pace, the staff are wonderful giving you instructions and they provide a helmet to wear. The track itself lasts approx 5/10 mins depending on speed and pace I would say. Once you've finished at the end of the track , you take the cable car skyline back up and this was amazing seeing the views from up above as it's an open cable car. In terms of attire , I had a maxi dress on and it was fine , little kids can also go on the luge. I would highly recommend as it is something fun to do on the island .
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Singapore: Gardens by the Bay|5| “Beautiful gardens ”|review_458894712|I came here with my husband and although walking to the gardens was quite a long walk from the station. It was well worth it.The gardens are made of free public space to walk around and then two paid enclosed domes and also the bridge between the light trees require a paid ticket. Firstly the free park is stunning , very relaxing and so much room to walk around and take in the calming atmosphere .The two domes are also worth the money I would say, one is made up of many different flowers and plants from around the world . Whilst the other has a rainforest theme , with a huge indoor waterfall, both beautiful . Please note, do bring a jacket or cardigan as it is cold in the domes from the ac.In terms of food , there are around 6 food places located on site.The garden/ tree light shows commence around 7.45pm and last approx 15mins. This is free and can be viewed by sitting outside on the grass. It's stunning, the music, the lights in the evening , truly breathtaking . 
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Singapore: Marina Bay Sands Skypark|5| “Amazing view from the deck ”|review_458894594|My husband and I initially came in the afternoon to the skypark but unfortunately as it was raining quite heavily outside , we were kindly told that we would need to come back when the weather was better and purchase tickets then . Thus we came back after a few hours towards the evening and honestly the view was stunning, you could view the light tree show from gardens by the bay , see the harbour and just generally Singapore from up above . The staff were lovely but the queues to get and take the lift up were busy and to get out was also busy but honestly well worth it and everyone seemed cordially .Also on a side note , we thought you could maybe view the fountain show from the skypark but were told it is better to go down and see it by the water itself . I would recommend the skypark , the hotel is also stunning with the architecture design looking beautifully unusual .

Siloso beach is actually beautiful for Singapore and for being man made, it isn't like the Caribbean or the Maldives but it is nice and relaxing .One can walk along the sea front and on the sand, there were peacocks roaming around freely and yes you do see the harbour but that wasn't a deterrent for us. I found it to be peaceful with the waves coming in and the water was clean and not smelly. I would visit again and would recommend coming to see it and possibly bringing a picnic and blanket to relax on. 
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|5| “Fun day out ”|review_458359781|My husband and I spent the day here. Now I must mention my husband is an adrenaline junkie , whilst I would say I'm the opposite . Thus I felt that the theme park catered to the both of us. Getting here is fairly easy and everything is sign posted . We took the monorail which was fast but packed . I would recommend getting here early and possibly purchasing the fast track tickets for the additional cost . As the queues were very long when we went and for example the transformers ride we waited almost two hours to get in. It was also a very hot and humid day .The studios I mentioned catered to all ages I feel. I've not been to the Florida theme park so can only base my opinion on Singapore . But they have shows , roller coasters , boat rider , souvenir shops and quite a few food outlets on site . There are different themed sections, such as the mummy, Jurassic park , shrek, transformers etc and all have there different rides and shows taking place .There are times where you may need to use the lockers as certain rides require no personal belongings. Our personal favourite ride was the water boat ride at Jurassic park. You do get slightly wet but honestly it was a breath of fresh air as we went on a very hot and humid day (humidity was at 98%). Shrek 4D was also good fun and my husband enjoyed this with the chairs moving and splashes of water on the face . The water world show was excellent and the stunts and actors had the audience fully engaged . Staff I found to be lovely honestly , they were so helpful and the service was very good. There were a couple times when some of the rides were delayed or experiencing technical problems but apart from that it is a great fun day out for all ages . And the theme park closes at 7pm .

I would most definitely recommend coming here, I've not seen anything like it . If you feel you need to get away from the outside humidity or cannot sleep , go to mustafa centre for a stroll . The atmosphere is lively and I guarantee you'll come out with a purchase of some kind .

Although you will find similar stores all around, so if you do miss a store you're bound to come across it again.It's a good stroll and very packed but with a lovely atmosphere . There are also many shopping centres everywhere , around 10 on orchard road I think.So if you want to seek refuge from the humidity pop into any one of them to cool down .I would recommend visiting but recommend wearing comfortable shoes as you will do a lot of walking .
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Hotel|Singapore: One Farrer Hotel & Spa|5| “Amazing service ”|review_458350634|My hubby and I booked this hotel after reading reviews on trip advisor and doing many hours of research.Honestly we were not disappointed. We spent nine days at One Farrer Hotel and from the moment we walked through , every single member of the team were lovely , welcoming and approachable .I would like to thank all the staff and these were only a few of the names I had managed to get down Joselyn, Natalie, Melvin, Patrick, uwin, Aisha, cleaners , frank dengqinglong,shafik , lumen. But they were all so helpful and always willing to provide information on where to go, what to visit , restaurants etc.The room itself is reasonably sized, with a waterfall shower and kettle. The hotel provide daily complimentary refreshments such as a range of teas, soft drinks , free water, packet of crisps and nuts. Everything can be controlled on the electronic pad from the blinds to the lights . The hotel also lend guests an umbrella in-case of a downpour (which we made use of towards the end of our trip). The spa is very very relaxing , with there being a separate section for men and women. You have the huge jacuzzi with a mini waterfall feature, hot and cold pool, sauna, steam room and massage rooms. The spa facilities are complimentary but the massages must be paid for .The outside rooftop pool is lovely, clean and peaceful they have deck chairs with parasols and a bar outside , right by the pool you have a small garden with benches under the shade also for relaxing . There's also a 24 hour restaurant and a bar at the hotel .In terms of location the hotel is excellently placed, right near the heart of little India (less than 5mins walk away) in between two shopping malls, one being the fantastic one stop shop Mustafa centre. Very convenient for buying food or just bits and bobs. The MRT is also a mere few seconds walk from the hotel which is great for getting around and public transport travel is excellent in Singapore , nothing is too far. There's also a taxi stand right outside the hotel. And my husband and I did also walk to Arab town from the hotel which was a 20 minute walk. I would highly recommend staying here to anyone and I would definitely return to One Farrer. You made our Singapore experience a truly memorable one.

The tour lasted for around 45 minutes and there was quite a bit of hilltop walking required , so comfy shoes are a must .Tour guide was Canadian but she told us of the history and how this is where Rome began and battles took place.The views from the hilltop are lovely and can see the basilica in a distance .I would highly recommend to see

As I didn't have much time and saw it in the evening, so go early as possible to avoid the crowds I would say.

The area is very lively , I didn't go too far up and went halfway but that was still beautiful . The views are not amazing but it's lovely knowing you've been there to see it. There are many little restaurants and gelato places nearby once finished .
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Vatican City: Citta del Vaticano|5| “Cannot miss !”|review_432517320|First and foremost please wear comfortable shoes when coming to the Vatican City, as there is quite a bit of walking required. And it's more than likely you'll be seeing a couple of sites and spending most of the day here.The Vatican City is almost like it's taking you back in time , the history and culture is everywhere .The Vatican museums , Sistine chapel , St. Peter's Basilica are all within the same area but require great amount of walking to get to. The sites are breathtaking to think of the history . I would definitely recommend setting off early and spending the morning / afternoon here exploring visiting the sites .
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Vatican City: Basilica di San Pietro|5| “Beautiful ”|review_432516505|The basilica is located in the Vatican City . It does require a bit of walking to get to.Please bear in mind that it is free to get inside and thus the queue is extremely long with waiting times lasting for two hours . So my advice to all , would be to arrive bright and early and try and do the Vatican museum along with the Sistine chapel .Anyway back to St. Peter's , once pass security and inside the Basilica , it's beautiful with the sculptures and water features. You don't need very long in here , less than 30 minutes I would say .Definitely worth a visit if visiting Rome for the first time .
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Vatican City: Sistine Chapel|5| “Beautiful ”|review_432515745|The Sistine chapel is truly stunning , well worth the walk around the Vatican museum. Once inside the chapel , you can see many artwork around in the ceilings and walls . It does get crowded and there is limited seating but well worth a visit if coming to Rome.
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Vatican City: Vatican Museums|5| “Truly breathtaking ”|review_432515379|This is a must see when visiting Rome . Please try and purchase tickets online beforehand to avoid long queues for the museum and sisteen chapel . Once in, I would say leave yourself around 3/4hrs to go around the museum and Sisteen chapel at a leisurely pace.The artwork is incredible, the Egyptian artefacts are amazing and the sculptures .There is a lot of walking involved and many stairs to get through before getting to the chapel but once there , again the artwork on the ceiling is stunning. To think these were done many many years ago .Highly recommend if coming to Rome and somewhere I would visit again .

Did not buy tickets beforehand and therefore bought group tour tickets at the site as the single ticket queue was very very long .Would highly recommend to pre book online if you can as will save so much time. Onto the colosseum, first and first as mentioned myself and my friend purchased group tour tickets on site on the day, they were slightly more but we couldn't handle the waiting time for the single queue . Once in , our tour guide took us around for 45 minutes stopping off at the main points to give us some history and information which was great. As before going I didn't know too much about the colosseum.It is an amazing place and to think it's survived for so long. I would highly recommend visiting . The metro is directly opposite and there are quite a few restaurants nearby also .
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Hotel|Rome: Hotel Giuliana|5| “Great little hotel with excellent service ”|review_431618141|First of all I would like to say thank you to Jean, Ashwin, Antonio and the breakfast ladies (I do apologise , as I didn't manage to get the names ). The staff here are all lovely and really take their time to make you feel at home and comfortable . Breakfast was simple but filling with all the necessities such as tea, cereal, pastries and yoghurt / toast. Which is served from 7am -9.30am and is very convenient as you don't have to leave the hotel to pop out for breakfast.Wifi is included in the rooms and is very fast.Location is great, 10 min walk to termini station and around 20 min walk to the Spanish steps, trevi fountain, collesium and 10 min walk to republic station , st national road where you have many shops and gelato places. The hotel itself is located on a main road. With a great halal pizza place based next door, the gentleman in there is very friendly and welcoming with closing time being at midnight. Also a gelato place also next door to the pizza restaurant closing at 11.30pm. Pharmacy , supermarket , tobacco store, souvenir shop all across the street and open until late.I would definitely stay here again , the hotel is small but comfy and has what one needs, a little shower room, tv, hairdryer and complimentary toiletries . The staff are also fluent in English and you feel very safe and secure at the hotel , with the big brown front doors .You won't be disappointed , staff are more than happy to offer advice on where to go and how to get there and willing to talk and overall extremely hospitable . Would stay here again :)As hotel is in the heart of Rome , you can also find many other restaurants , buses and hop off hop on bus tours nearby which is great for getting around and seeing Rome .Please be warned though , when coming to Rome to wear comfy shoes as there is a lot of walking and exploring to be done . Feet may hurt .

And I must say it is a lot bigger than I expected it to be with a number of shops and food outlets . There's also the huge supermarket Carrefour which is great to pick up almost anything . Outside they had a Ferris wheel and bit of a small funfair going on. Great evening out for a stroll around , although could do with a few more benches outside to sit on .

Walking by the sea was lovely and there are many benches to sit on and take a break . There are not as many restaurants as one would hope but you do have quite a handful of dessert places and couple fast food eating place to go to. Also a great place to cycle along and can walk up to the marina mall where there are a large selection of shops and bit of a funfair outside . Overall good leisurely evening out .

We took the metro and the walk from the station to the marina was not long at all. Once we got to the main section we walked around the marina and first thing we thought of was how beautiful it all looked from the yachts to the tall buildings .As we were walking along , we got approached to do a private boat tour. After thinking about this, we then decided to go ahead and do it . All I can say is that it was pretty amazing , to have the boat to ourselves and get to see the palm islands , burj al Arab , emirate towers, Atlantis , the sheikhs yacht etc. It was truly breathtaking and our tour guides took us around for an hour . After the boat tour we started walking around again and it does get busy in the evening, also to mention there are a huge number of restaurants , bars and dessert places to go to. My husband and I finally chose pizza for our dinner and we were not disappointed . Then after we had bought dessert from another place and had it outside on a bench whilst admiring the view .We wanted to come back and visit the marina but didn't have time . This is definitely worth a visit and one can easily spend a good few hours here . 
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Dubai: Ibn Battuta Mall|5| “Beautiful and educational shopping mall ”|review_335904685|My husband and I were staying at the Movenpick hotel across from the mall, so Battuta was in a great location from us and we'd been there a couple of times . Upon visiting you are taken away by the interior of the mall, they have different sections each representing a different country , from Egypt, to Tunisia, India etc. Not only is everything on one floor but they have a huge number of fast food outlets inside and some great restaurants outside by the fountains . On our first visit we had lunch on the food court , I tried the Persian food which was excellent and my husband had a burger from another chain and he loved this also .We then visited again one evening and had dinner at the Indian restaurant outside , again food and service was of excellence . Next door to the Indian restaurant there was a Thai restaurant which looked wonderful but unfortunately we did not have time to try their cuisine , so hopefully on our next visit we will.The shops are also very convenient , from a huge supermarket to more mid range clothes, shoes and sports stores and pharmacy Boots , currency exchange etc . Just to also mention they also have a kids store with games Inside , where the kids seemed to be having a great time . It's not nowhere near as crowded and as large as Dubai mall but this means you can easily get from one section to another . There are also a number of stunning features inside , such as a huge boat , a life size elephant and wherever you walk you can read up on ancient Islam and view some key ancient pieces such a compass for praying in the direction of Saudi . There was also a very humble and friendly man from Morocco writing out people's names in Arabic in the mall and he was fantastic and my husband and I would like to say thank you for our gifts , our loved ones truly appreciated it . Overall this is a great little treasure to visit , especially if you want to escape the hustle and bustle . I would highly recommend and would definitely love to go back to visit .
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Dubai: Aquaventure Waterpark|5| “Good day out ”|review_334812713|My husband and I came here together . First of all I must admit I am not a fan of water parks and therefore I am thankful that there is something here for everyone . I did the lazy river which was nice, you sit in the float thing and it takes you around the water park . There are also a number of pool lounge areas to relax by with sun deck chairs available.My husband did all the rides and there wasn't too much of a queue . He seemed to enjoy it but the main qualm he had was that it was very confusing to get around which is true . The signage for the rides are very poor. The map is also very poor, it doesn't explain what each ride is and so you won't know whether it is for thrill seekers or not . And also majority of the time you need to have your float with you which it doesn't state in the leaflet . Again it could be better explained in this. The water was also very cold especially for this time of the year and I guess part of me thought it would be heated or at least the pool areas but they are not . There are many lifeguards and members of staff present which is great to see. You cannot take food in, so my husband and I had food outside and then came back in as we couldn't seem to find something to suit us and didn't want to walk for long trying to find the different restaurants as they are scattered around the water park . Food is pricey but to be expected for Atlantis.In terms of drinks you cannot bring this in, although I do think they should allow you to bring water and bottled soft drinks as it is expensive .The locker rooms are well maintained but again pricey , bring your own towels otherwise you will have to pay . The beach area is lovely and relaxing, the water again was cold for this time of year , although as my husband and I got closer we could smell the sea water and it smelt a lot like sewage water so decided against paddling in . Overall a good day out and not sure we'll come back, maybe next time we'll try a different water park just to see what others are like but well worth visiting . Atlantis itself is stunning and you do need to take a cab if you are not staying there, the line for the can to get back was huge.
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Dubai: Burj Khalifa|5| “Excellent views ”|review_334810899|My husband and I bought tickets to visit the burj for the 124th floor and we got to see downtown Dubai just before the sun started to set and immediately after . It was a beautiful view and you can see the burj al Arab from a distance and the Palm islands . The dancing fountains can be seen and heard which is amazing but be warned that it can get crowded round the glass once the show takes place . Being honest it was a good couple hours spent and nice to know you've been inside the tallest building . It is slightly pricey for what it is and the photos are very expensive . But the architecture is beautiful.
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Dubai: The Dubai Mall|5| “Great large shopping mall”|review_334809871|My husband and I took the metro to the mall . It was easily accessible via metro but people be aware that once you get off the metro there is a lot of walking inside before you get to the shopping centre . They do have the flat escalators not sure maybe six or so which you can stand on and it will take you through . But this alone can take 15/20minutes. Once inside the mall , it is truly amazing . Every shop you can think of is there from high end designer stores to mid/lower range . The amount of food choices is endless . You also have the waterfall feature which is beautiful, the dancing fountains outside , more eating places also outside , and you can see the burj from outside which are all stunning in the evening .This is an excellent day out with a cinema and ice skating rink also in the mall but please be warned that there will be a lot of walking to be done , as to get from one area to another takes time so please wear comfortable shoes .
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Dubai: Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo|5| “Couples visit , good few hours well spent ”|review_334808213|My husband and I had bought tickets for the aquarium and underwater zoo . The ticket also included the boat ride and a subliminal submarine ride . As other reviewers have said the tunnel wasn't overly amazing and lasted for 30 minutes if that. You basically just walk through the tunnel and see majority of sharks and sting rays, which you can briefly see from the outside display . The best parts come after when going onto the next level upstairs. The first thing is the subliminal ride , where you step into a machine which takes you on a very short animation journey where you are standing inside . The animation here was good but the machine ride again was not the best , it could be more innovative. Maybe have people sitting down and do it in 3D would have been better .After this was the glass bottom boat ride, this was ok. You wear a life jacket and it goes around the pool like area for around 5/7minutes and you can see the fishes underneath . Once this was done we went around the underwater zoo and this was brilliant , getting to see all the different species of animals , from bats, to lizards , to giant crabs, penguins etc , the best part was definitely seeing King croc and his girlfriend just relaxing , although it did seem like a small area for them .Overall I would say this is a good few hours well spent , maybe more could be done to enhance the experience of a few areas but kids and adults will enjoy this and it's not too pricey either which is a bonus .

The views are absolutely stunning , one can see other man made islands being built , to the sky high buildings and the palaces from a distance . Also the voucher enables you to get some food or drinks, my husband had the chicken sandwich which he loved and I enjoyed the Caesar salad but they do have other options available. Food and drinks can be eaten whilst enjoying the scenery from up above and there was a very relaxing, calming atmosphere which was lovely . Service was great from staff and as mentioned earlier would highly recommend to others for a visit !!!
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Hotel|Abu Dhabi: Rosewood Abu Dhabi|5| “The best hotel i have ever stayed at and will surely be back !!!”|review_332994667|Firstly my husband and I would like to say a huge thank you to Dounia, Hiromi, Toufix our butler , Othman, Ghaith, Karyna,Ainum, concierge , the porters, security and Shirley who works in the spa for making our stay so special and memorable and apologies for anyone else I have missed out . I would also like to say thank you to the engineers who came in to fix the heating in our room on such short notice . Ok where to begin upon arrival to this hotel you are greeted from the moment you step out the car, the staff took our luggage and placed it in our rooms. Walking through the lobby there was this beautiful rose scented smell in the air and arriving at reception desk we were offered a lovely date drink I think it was. We were then introduced to our butler Toufix and honestly he was so kind to my husband and I. Taking the time to show us around and helping us navigate our way through the hotel . The room is controlled via the iPad, which means the tv, lighting, curtains etc can be controlled from a touch of the button. Toufix demonstrated this to my husband and I and we just loved the simplicity of it.The room itself was beautiful and very comfortable, you won't be disappointed , we had a pool view , with a large bathtub, two sinks , separate shower and toilet section. Complimentary toiletries are also provided as is a nail care kit and sewing kit .The hotel is attached to the luxurious Galleria mall and what a mall it is. It is very high end but so convenient if needing to do some shopping or wanting to eat out at one of the restaurants, the afghan restaurant is definitely worth going into . The hotel also has a number of restaurants also worth a try such as the Lebanese restaurant . The spa facilities are excellent, the swimming pool is heated and huge and there is a deep and shallow end with changing rooms nearby and friendly lifeguards on site. The gym and sauna, jacuzzi, steam room are all complimentary and again are of excellent standards and these are separated for males and females to respect the culture . Shirley took such great care of me and I would have arranged a couples massage for me and my husband but did not have time . The staff were always friendly and approachable and would always take time to converse with us and give us recommendations on where to go and they always remembered the finer details . Also as it was my birthday, I was under the assumption that my husband had forgotten but little did I know that at midnight I had a knock on our door and my husband had arranged with the rosewood staff a cake, flowers , balloon and card. So again thank you to you all, as I did not expect this and was truly surprised . I cannot rave about this hotel enough, location wise it's on another island and away from any hustle and bustle . Majority of things in Abu Dhabi are in driving distance and you will find that you will be using cabs as the main form of transport which is fine and not very expensive .Overall an absolute pleasure to stay in and my husband and I will return. Thank you rosewood !!!

The show lasts for around three minutes and it does get crowded so try to get there slightly early to get a good viewing spot. There are also plenty of restaurants and bars around and people of all ages would be fascinated by this, wish they had something similar in London !
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Abu Dhabi: Ferrari World Abu Dhabi|5| “Day trip out”|review_332869274|Me and my husband spent the day here and it was very entertaining . They had a number of food outlets within and also being so close to the yas shopping centre was very convenient . There were a number of fun rides with the worlds fastest roller coaster and another roller coaster . My only negatives are that there could be slightly more to do and the map doesn't go into detail about what each ride is about . Also my husband and I were upset that we couldn't do the Lap around the race track as you need to put your name on a list beforehand , again this was not mentioned and thus we missed out on this ride which is a shame. Overall a good few hours spent .
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Abu Dhabi: Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center|5| “Tour of sheikh zayed mosque ”|review_332749431|Me and my husband took part in the free 45/1hr tour, Unfortunately I cannot remember the name of our tour guide but he was a young, intelligent and funny lad. The mosque is truly beautiful , words cannot describe . Our tour guide took us around and explained in detail how the mosque came about and what each section represents and he took the time to answer questions and make the tour interesting and educational . Dressing appropriately is a must, ladies must be covered and men too out of respect . Seeing the mosque during the day and night is something out of this world , I would highly recommend this visit and cannot praise the staff enough for how well the grounds both inside and out are so very well maintained .
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Hotel|Dubai: Movenpick Ibn Battuta Gate Hotel Dubai|5| “Seven nights at IBN”|review_332747897|First of all I would like to start off with how stunning the hotel looks inside out, the architecture is truly spectacular . Upon arrival at the hotel the staff were all very friendly and the staff outside the hotel were always very welcoming and warm especially Romel who went out of his way to chase down the taxi we were in as my husband had left his camera by mistake . Me and my husband stayed on a breakfast board only and the breakfast was amazing , everything you can think of they had . The staff were also very welcoming and warm in the mornings and Sanjay used to come over to say hello to us which was nice. The hotel isn't far from the metro station only a five minute walk which is a bonus and makes getting around not only easier but also cheaper and it's also a direct line to the airport which is great, getting taxis are also pretty quick and the hotel staff outside can arrange this within minutes . The shopping centre is so convenient as it's literally across the street, a two minute walk if that . There you will find so many shops and eating diners from fast food to restaurants outside and it's truly amazing the interior . The facilities are pretty great in the hotel , with a number of restaurants from Chinese, Italian and Indian to the moroccan bar, gym is complimentary and the pool on the 8th floor also complimentary to use. My only qualms to do with the hotel is that for such a large hotel I would expect them to have more spa facilities especially considering it is a very large 5* hotel , so possibly sauna, steam room and jacuzzi but unfortunately they don't . Also in terms of the pool, the water wasn't very warm at all and the sun doesn't seem to shine well on the water making it seem even colder and windier on the rooftop. In regards to the Moroccan bar, my husband loved the fact he could watch the football outside whilst sipping on a mock tail but the downside is they do make you leave at 1/2am which for a bar you would assume would open a little later especially if it's still packed and the football is showing . The bedroom itself is fairly a reasonable size, the lighting could be better but the services provided from free water, tea, coffee, iron and ironing board, hairdryer makes it so much easier to stay . The bathroom is what is truly beautiful with the sliding wall where you can watch tv from the comfort of a bathtub . Concierge were also very helpful and suggested on places to go and visit and best ways of getting there . Overall this was an excellent stay and I would recommend anyone wanting to stay outside the hustle and bustle to consider movenpick as you won't be disappointed .
FJ03|5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998|Attractions|Dubai: Platinum Heritage Luxury Tours and Safaris|5| “Dessert safari evening with husband ”|review_332673727|My husband had booked this evening dessert safari with platinum heritage after reading excellent reviews on trip advisor and honestly we were not disappointed . Our driver was Hamza and he was from Morocco , he collected us from our hotel in a 4x4 vehicle and called when he was outside . The journey was very comfortable and he made me and my husband feel very welcomed , he was also very humorous. Also to mention we did share the car with two other couples which was fine and not a problem whatsoever and allowed us to meet new people which made the journey fun and interesting . After driving for an hour or so we the swapped to another vehicle which was better equipped for the dessert sand . After telling Hamza that I was scared of bumpy rides he let me sit in the front passenger seat. We stopped off at the dessert to see a falcon show whereby they provided refreshments and were allowed to take pictures with the Falcon and on the dessert sand. The views of the dessert were truly breathtaking and the falcon show was brilliant . Once this was finished we hopped back into the vehicle and went to camp. The camp felt private and secluded , they had henna artist asma who was so quick at doing beautiful henna designs and did mine within minutes. Also to mention the bathroom facilities were excellent, modern and clean. Shisha , dancer, camel riding and so many courses of food were also available . The food was delicious and cooked right there in the ground, from starters of salad, hummus , puff pastries of meat, cheese and flat bread which was delicious and made by asma's sister to the main courses of chicken , lamb , rice with lamb or vegetable rice, camel meat, dessert of Arabic doughnuts and fruits and lots of soft cold drinks . Once this was all finished we were entertained by a traditional Arabic dancer who performed so gracefully and doing shisha under the stars with my husband. Overall this was a great day spent and well worth the money , we got dropped off back to our hotel and thank Hamza and the team for a lovely , memorable evening.

My hubby had surprised me with the sky view bar at the burj al Arab and upon arrival we were greeted by Ronetham. She was so friendly, funny and polite from the offset and made us feel so welcomed . She took the time to converse with us and the waiters Hussain And Roshem were equally helpful and made conversation . My hubby had surprised me with a birthday cake and the staff brought the cake and a rose over, they offered to take a picture for us and allowed us to walk around when it was quiet to see the spectacular views. It was an amazing experience and one I won't forget.

My husband had surprised me with afternoon tea at the palace and Shi Shi took such great care of us and made us feel welcomed and took the time to converse with us . She explained all the types of cakes, sandwiches and teas available upon arrival in detail and checked on us to make sure we were ok. Also midway through my hubby surprised me with a birthday cake which Shi Shi brought out with a candle all lit up and started singing happy birthday to me :). Overall I had a great experience and the palace was truly beautiful , the only downside was that when my husband had made the booking no one had mentioned that you can visit the grounds on a kart, thus I would bear this mind and request this when visiting, as the palace is truly breathtaking .

As I really wanted to get henna done, they use only pure natural henna . The service was excellent , the lady did the design exactly how I showed her . The tortoises they own are all cute and adorable and it's in a great location , albeit just slightly difficult to notice in the dark. I would recommend to others

Right next to magnificent mile and Kinzie st. Everything is a short walk away else you have the option of the EL train.Cons: A very average room with the bedsheets and towels smelling weird. Since they all smelt the same, my assumption is that they were clean and its something to do with their laundry however it wasn't very pleasant. One could deal with it though.

Hence you will end up finding under construction areas like the passage to mardana mahal and around. In general I liked the property, its location (just 2 hours away from Delhi) and the views. However, our room smelt a slightly like how the bat infused old delhi heritage structures do. To add to it, I had big insect bites on my return. I know none bit me when I was awake hence I feel it was in the room (probably bed) as there was very little direct sunlight which entered the room. Its also tricky to choose the best room with sunlight/windows. It will still take time to develop/match up to other Neemrana properties.

When I heard and read about the river safari, I had thought that its gonna be a ride in a river however the cruise was just a 10 minute thing (and we didn't even see a single animal). Most of the safari has to be seen on foot and its a pretty long walk. I would definitely agree that their collection of river animals is great. And of course, their pandas! However, not exactly what I had in mind.TIP: Buy their pass for all four safaris combined. Much better!

I had actually imagined an open safari but visited at night. The disappointment was that it was more like a zoo that one visits at night. Still, you don't go to a zoo at night usually hence it is a different experience. And after all, when in Singapore, you have to visit it!
vidhu s|856D88909F9A1746A88AB7D27679DC5F|Attractions|Singapore: Fountain of Wealth|1| “What the Fuss!”|review_458280680|Such a disappointing piece of attraction. I simply don't understand why it is even there in the list of things to do in Singapore. Visit it only if you are waiting for your duck tour and have some 30-40 minutes to kill, as its walkable from there.

It may be a symbol for a traumatic time but design wise and as a tourist-attraction, it doesn't provide anything.
vidhu s|856D88909F9A1746A88AB7D27679DC5F|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|5| “#1 in Singapore! Here are a few tips!”|review_458277581|I was in Singapore on a family trip of 6 people. My parents and aunt are all above 60 while one of my cousins (24) doesn't like rides. That left me with just two of us who wanted to go to USS but I wasn't sure it justified taking all of them together and that too for an entry ticket priced at $75 each! However, it turned out to be the best day we spent in Singapore. One, it offers rides and entertainment for people of all the ages. My parents sat in ALL the rides! (I was surprised). Here are the highlights:1. The best ever stage show that I had ever seen (WATERWORLD).2. Best 4D show/ride ever. (TRANSFORMERS)3. Lights, Camera and Action.4. Great rides for adventure freaks.Here are some tips for all:TIP 1: try to visit it on a weekday. Although the queues that we found were on an average only 20%-30% occupied (of the capacity), we still ended up waiting for up to 30 minutes in a few rides.TIP 2: it is arranged in a circular layout. As soon as you enter it, look for where the crowd seems to be heading. Start walking in the opposite direction! ;)TIP 3: Single passengers have a separate queue. If you don't have a condition to sit together on a ride, it will save at least 70% of your time.TIP 4: Buy your tickets through an agent in Singapore. I got my tickets at a discount of $20 per person.TIP 5: This was the only attraction I found which gives discounted tickets for the elderly (60+) irrespective of their nationality. Tickets for my parents costed me $36 each.TIP 5: Food is very expensive inside. If you don't wanna spend that much, try getting something with you. (Before entering USS you will also find a few joints like McDonald's).
vidhu s|856D88909F9A1746A88AB7D27679DC5F|Attractions|Singapore: Jurong Bird Park|4| “Interesting attraction.”|review_458082964|A really interesting attraction, considering you may actually get to meet and feed birds which is usually not possible in a day to day life.Tip 1: Try to go as early as possible (maybe by 9AM) so that maximum number of hungry birds come to you (in Lory Loft).Tip 2: Wear colorful clothes.Tip 3: Do not miss the shows.

vidhu s|856D88909F9A1746A88AB7D27679DC5F|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Flyer|3| “Mixed feelings!”|review_458080652|So this is on one of the must-do list of Singapore. I agree that it is a good experience but how unique, I am not sure. A tip maybe is that try to visit it during a clear sky and sunset time.

Here are some tips.”|review_458079316|Largely consists of four parts: The Cloud Dome, The Flower Dome, The Supertrees and Open Gardens.Cloud Dome is the most interesting of them all while the flower dome was rather disappointing. A rather big site, it involves a lot of walking.Tip 1: Do check the time when they release mist to create clouds in the cloud dome.Tip 2: You may hire a wheelchair for $2 for the whole day.Tip 3: You may skip the open gardensTip 4: Check out the light and sound show in the evening (7 or 8 PM).Tip 5: After the visit, walk to Satay by the bay and have some cheap but good food.

Unfortunately, this vehicle runs on an engine that produces loud generator-like noise. If you pick to try this tour, try to sit right in the front as otherwise you will not be able to hear what the guide is saying. It is OK as a one-time experience but given that it is a one hour tour for $37, it is very costly (My parents paid $36 for their universal studios ticket!). Try to book it through some agent in Singapore.

Unfortunately, it turned out to be a big disappointment. The interiors looked like a B-grade Delhi restaurant and the food was only Indian in name. I think the only USP of this restaurant is the 'hot-hot' food, as one of the staff put it, which basically means a load full of chillies in your food. I have been to other Indian and Pakistani restaurants abroad and this restaurant can't match the way their food is rich in flavors (without chillies).

Unfortunately this restaurant was my first point of disappointment. The only thing good about it was its serving size. Even their small bowls are more than what an average person will have (without coke)! However, when it came to taste, I was simply chewing something. I had the meatballs spaghetti and did try a few bites from my friends' plates.

But that does not mean the food was bad. Their tiramisu was great. And it comes in A BIG bowl which atleast 8 people can have after having a full meal.

Everything served was cold...even the coffee! Scrambled eggs had literally turned into a solid pie-like consistency and the bacon was very hard. The only good thing about the restaurant was the junior (serving) staff. They were very courteous and prompt. At this point I should also point that when we entered the restaurant, the 'host' (a senior staff who is supposed to seat you in) looked at us and asked if we had 'ever had a buffet earlier'! Thinking about it later, I find this really offensive!

Cleanliness was good but then that is the most basic thing one would expect for that budget. Nothing extraordinary. The room service was also very average. I asked for a thermometer (along with two more things). They forgot to send the thermometer and after reminding them, someone came up to give me a thermometer which I didn't know how to use. On asking if he could help, he simply said in an offended manner: "how would I know. I am security".

The second thing is their brewed beer which is great and competes with its European likes! Third is food. Almost everything that we tried was great. We particularly didn't like the Salmon and Beef (main course) but overall the food is great.

However, for me, what differentiates a hotel from another is the customer experience which wasn't great. We ended up reaching the hotel 3 hours prior to checkin. The plan was to keep the luggage and head out to explore the city. However the receptionists told us that the room will be ready very soon and asked us to wait. After about an hour, we were allotted a room. We had specifically asked for a non-smoking room (and it was allotted to us), however a smoke filled room welcomed us. Neither did the hotel staff care to check the room before allotting it to us, nor did they seem to have checked it on the previous guest's check-out (that they smoked in a non-smoking room)! Post this, again we were told to wait a bit. However again we were made to wait for two hours! During this time, none of the staff cared to inform us that it is gonna take time. It ended up wasting our time in the short trip that we had planned.Disappointed.

It is quite expensive, but its understandable because everything in Singapore is expensive.I'm also happy that the crew speaks Tagalog. but what i'm not happy about is that their food doesn't taste the same as the original Jollibee. Chicken not crispy, gravy tastes different and the spaghetti is sour, not as sweet as the original spaghetti.

My favorite attraction is The Transformers and Shrek, I've tried them twice.I did not try the food, I ate at Malaysian food street outside USS and their Laksa soup is really good. Advantage for solo traveller is that I don't have to fall in line for long cause they have a single rider queue. IF not because of that I might've hated my trip because there were a loooot of people that day. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely go back.

Good thing I called Agoda and got their updated phone number, I texted them and I got respond in minute, which turn things around for us.Richard, the owner is very helpful to offer transportation arrangement for us prior to our arrival. He also gave me a lot of additional helpful information with our stay. We arrived at the hotel at 1:00am and he is still up and waiting for us and lead us directly to our room. The location of the establishment is in the center of the town, just 3 minutes walk to the beach. The place is neat, modest and clean. They serve breakfast for a fee, it could have been a lot better if the breakfast can be served faster, tip: you can request for the breakfast night before.The rooms are not too big, but its clean, has cabinets and clean and good looking comfort room. The aircon works well, they also have a fan and basic beddings. Toiletries included is a small piece of soap and tissue.They also offer cheaper tour packages and vehicle rental. They have their own boat and tour guide, The food that they serve during tour in my opinion is a lot better than the other group we saw eating at the beach from different tour agency,Food in their store is cheaper also compared to food you can buy outside. Plus they serve unlimited coffee and chocolate drink.If someone would ask me to suggest a place when travelling to El Nido, I would definitely recommend this place to them. If I would go back to El Nido, I definitely would stay with RciGem again without hesitation.Wifi work decently.

Most of the negative comments on this hotels are from people who are expecting a 5 star, luxurious accommodation when they only pay a small amount of money for Mandarin. Based on my experience, the services and amenities they provide are more than enough for a 3500pesos per night stay in this beautiful hotel.They have a very spacious room with comfortable beds, elegant bed rooms, very large bathroom with bath tub, complete with shampoo, body wash, soap, toothpaste, toothbrush, hotel slippers, and complimentary water and coffee.Not only that, you enjoy a free breakfast buffet that cost 500 pesos each for free. The location of the hotel is also spot on, right on the center of Cebu, just a walking distance from Ayala Mall. If someone would rate this hotel negatively, I suggest you try to go to Marriott, or Radisson Blu or Marco Polo where they have to pay 4 to 5 times of what they pay in Mandarin Plaza.

The room is new, the bathroom is spotless and they the the complete toiletries, from toothbrush, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and ever cotton buds.

This hotel is one of the cheapest, but still pricey for me. They are on the farthest side of Moal boal shore which is just okay cause we only stayed there for 1 night. Its a basic accommodation with basic beds and toiletries. The only let down during our stay is that 1. We had to wait too long before we were able to check in to our rooms. 2. They don't have 24/7 reception, we left around 5am and no one is around to assist us. 3. Staff needs more training, they are not so helpful when we asked for some information such as renting a service back to the main road. 4. Their toilet flush is not working properly, and we reported it at around 5pm, but the plumber check our room when were already sleeping at 9pm.Good thing about the hotel is that they have all the basic things you need. The resort is also facing the beach, it has beautiful surrounding as well, they have a garden, a pool, beautiful restaurant that is overlooking the sea. And they serve very good food too.

I had a very close encounter with them. I have bad pictures because i am focusing my attention with the beautiful creatures. Though i fell bad for them because theres a risk they might get hurt.

Thier food is actually good. All the seafoods that we ordered here are fresh, actually better than the ones we ordered in Talipapa. though I can comment on the value because I'm not the one who paid for it.The crew are also nice, the hobbits are actually very accommodating. We actually asked them if the kitchen staff are also small people, but they politely answered that the kitchen staff have normal sized people.

We keep on coming back not only because the food is cheap and their chicken really tastes good, but the Mais con Hielo is really irresistible!

I have a very high expectation about this place when we went there for lunch before going back to Manila. Since its our last day and we don't want to ran out of money, we opted to order the cheapest meal they have. It is a piece of fried battered fish and steamed rice for 99pesos if i can remember it correctly.The steamed rice, well is a steamed rice that is very sticky and watery. The fish is big, but its bland, i can't taste anything, even a hint of salt. The menu say, if you didn't like the food you don't have to pay, But I'm really not in the mood to complaint for a food cost 99 pesos each.I still wanted to go back there to see if my experience will change when i order different product.

That is if you wanted to spend 10 times of what you are paying for Club Ten. This inexpensive hotel is worth the money. They got all the basic thing you need, comfy bed, working aircon, decent bathroom, spacious room, 2 mins walk to the beach, near DMALL, free breakfast, clean towels.The room we got is good for 6 people, two double bed on the main floor, and 1 queen size bed in the loft. The room is clean, and complete with basic amenities, they also have kitchen and a refrigerator. They also provide free Club Ten container plastic bag. The staff of this hotel are very helpful, they allowed us to check in at 7am without having to pay extra money.They attend to our needs right away when we request for anything. The location of the hotel is also okay, between station 1 and 2. Not too crowded area.

I liked that they serve gelato too! I went here on my birthday with 9 other people and availed their AMEX promo which will take 50% off for all 10 of us. If not for this I would not pay 1000+ for a lunch buffet. For me it's sulit for the amount we paid after the discount, but for people who are paying in full, i think its a bit overpriced.I love their beef steak, its tender and well season. But not the lamb, its very chewy and not season perfectly. I also didn't like their seafood and tempura, its bland.But they turned it ll around when it comes to the dessert. they have a lot of choices, and they all taste amazing. I would definitely go back if given a discount again.

If you are tired of snorkelling you can just sit at the edge of the boat, and you will clearly see the fishes from the boat since there are really a lot of them.

However this one is really different. It's literally hot, not warm but hot. It took me an hour before i can dip my whole body in the water. One thing made it special is that it is a salt water hot spring. It is really relaxing and beautiful. You have to go here at around 7pm or else you will cook yourself to death. LOL. From our hotel, we rented a tricycle going here, they waited for us at the place and brought us back to the hotel. It is a must try side trip in Coron. You can drop by to the Cashew store going here too.

There are also duyan where you spend time before going back to snorkelling. there are a lot of fishes here, some of them are really big. I also saw some stingray near the shore. The island also has a fine white sand, aside from that, there's also a bermuda grass on the shore that made the island looked cooler and fresher. Im not sure if I remember it correctly but this island is being bought by Hennan Group of Company to build a private resort.

There are plenty of fishes, they are really massive. You can just stay in you place and the will will come near you. When it comes to corals, there are some good hard and soft corals. But there are places where corals are dead and bleached. Nonetheless this is really an amazing snorkelling site. And i really wanted to go back here.

Aside from the view that you will see during the hiking, when you get there is a different story. It is serene, majestic, beautiful. You will feel joy and a little scary because its like you are in a different world already. The best part is when we went inside the cave. Our tour guide helped us to enter the cave and swam inside. The lake is deep, but was clear, you can clearly see the bottom and the rock formation below. I was also surprised to see fishes in it. the water is so cold, and its very clean, to thing that the water there is stagnant because its a lake. Its a must see attraction in Coron. Its special and beautiful.

They are very accommodating from the time I contacted them in their facebook account for the reservation. Because it is budget trip, i opted to book a fan room, first time to travel with a fan room accommodation. They also assisted us with the airport transfer for only 200 pesos each. It was such a blissful transfer, they keep on doing follow up on us from the time we checked in NAIA in Manila, until the driver picked us up at Coron Airport. When we arrived at the hotel, the staff greeted us and showed us to our room. Honestly, I was disappointed with the room, it was dark and very very hot. It's a good thing that the lady owner of the hotel is very honest to tell us that it is really hot there even at night. So we asked if they vacant AC room, luckily they have, but we have to move to a different room after a night because that room is reserved for the following day. We did not mind that and we transferred to an AC room, we added around 500 pesos difference per night. The AC room is a completely different story, it was tiny, but very clean and comfortable. There are several fan room and the owner said that most of the takers are the foreigner who loves sleeping in a hot room.They do not serve breakfast so i think the price i paid for the AC room is somehow expensive than it has to be. Good thing the hotel is near a carinderia where we can get bfast for only 30 pesos. This is a decent in, the location is good because it is close to the port, but the neighborhood is kinda scary, but there's a security guard 24/7. there are also a lot of cockroaches outside the building.One good thing about this hotel is that the staff are really helpful and accommodating, they would suggest places to eat and they even assisted us in getting a tricycle going to maquinit hot spring for a very reasonable price. everything is walking distance from this inn.

So we decided to just walk around the town and look for something light and inexpensive, we stumbled at this restaurant where only two people are eating, we ordered pasta, the order took time before it got served to us. Surprisingly, the pasta really tastes good. The owner was also there, and he was nice. We planned to come back again, but because we only stayed for 3 nights and we wanted to try other places to eat, we were not able to return.

This is on of the cheapest option in the town, but still a little bit expensive for the kind of food that they serve. The foods are ordinary canteen food, not bad at all. Good thing about his place is that you wont be intimidated because there staff are helpful, the place is also very conveniently located in the town center and the design of the canteen is somehow refreshing because of the open air.

But what I love the most is their fruit shake, it delicious and cheap.The ambiance of the area is also good, though it is hot, they have this gigantic industrial fan. The location is just in the center of the town.

We started off early and we were there before the gates opened at 10 am but even then we greeted by a huge queue when we reached there. I read a lot of reviews before we went there to prioritize the rides , but so did everyone else !!! So we spent 2 hours in the queue for a 4 min ride which was supposed to be the star attraction - Transformers. Then we decided to do our own thing which worked out better because we were able to cover the next shows of waterworld and some of the kids rides which my 6 year old daughter absolutely loved .... Sesame Street, Madagascar, Shrek 4D. By evening a lot of the crowd had dwindled and its a good thing that the timings are now extended because we were able to cover almost everything that we wanted to. We were even able to take a second shot at Transformers without any waiting time and it was soo much fun !!

Overall a nice ,clean hotel at an Excellent location which is close to the bus station. We made our bookings through booking.com which mentioned that breakfast is included .But when we reached the hotel , we came to know that as per the hotel policy breakfast is chargeable for Kids . This was not mentioned anywhere on the website. When we pointed that out to the clerk , he said that we should approach Booking.com for this feedback and they cannot do anything about it. I find that very strange that they are willing to honor the bookings done through this website yet not willing to honor the terms and conditions as mentioned on it.
Bharat S|876AF4C67676E2E502C8A315BDB5DC8D|Hotel|Pondicherry: The Promenade|5| “One of the finest!”|review_497205840|Travelled with family and took accommodation in the suite. The suite left me speechless. A big, classy suite with window walls on two sides was an experience like no other. The marine drive and Gandhi statue were the highlights of the view. Overall the room ambience was terrific. The washroom too, adequately sized, had a Jacuzzi, which sadly I didnt get the time to enjoy.The restaurant served delicious food, especially the breakfast buffet, with on demand dishes and cuisines of different kinds. The dinner included was of plate system and was a little short on variety offered, delicious nonetheless. In room orders took a while to get delivered but were served hot and fresh.Also, taking your car to the hotel entrance could be a challenge since blockades are placed in the evening to make the marine drive car free for strollers. So you'll have to walk from the street corner to the hotel after evening time, which although shouldnt be an issueIn short a classic, beautiful hotel which would be my first choice if and when i visit again!

The rooms were big, neat and spacious. Both the living and bed rooms were adequately lit with window wall curtains opening towards the pool courtyard for that extra light and airiness. The bathroom was decent as well, with a bit problem in drainage which was taken care of. The balcony view was towards the hill and sipping morning tea sitting there in fresh air was a bliss. The only problem was that many power points were not working so had to take turns to charge our equipment. The restaurant served a variety of dishes and food was delicious. Whatsoever not a single negative point regarding the food, decor, ambience and service. Since we had to leave early in the morning, the staff prepared and packed ample breakfast for our journey.Would recommend to anybody looking for a luxurious stay and delicious food along with good ambience and service under one roof!

Sunway Putra is a huge complex, housing offices, a mall, hotel and so. the hotel complex is pretty clean, but the room service has big scope of improvement. it takes a lot of time to enter the complex and go all the way to your room and vice-versa, since it involves waiting for ever occupied elevators and even changing those at the lobby. the breakfast variety is really good and it will probably take you days just to enjoy each and every cuisine present there. the location too is good, not far from main attractions.

At peak of the flight(approx 1000 feet) Samarth (who is the copilot, and a god level pro by the way), transforms a plain paragliding experience into a roller coaster ride! Amazing stuff! PS. Carry lots of fluids to drink as it gets pretty hot and dry at the site.

Had a very pleasant stay and hardly faced any issue regarding the staff or amenities.

My favorite plaything is "transformers" because it's very exciting. I wanted to play battlestar garactica so much but it's closed for renovation. In the Universal studios have a lot of food that you can choose such as hamburgers, onion rings,etc. I really suggest you to go to 'Universal Studios.'

Great for this idea.-just a place to make money-a lot of species of monkey, free and that you never see-huge space for plants, small space dedicated to animals (they had trees, plants on a double space that elephants have to stay). In other Zoo, the most space is dedicated to animals not to plants and playground. Peoples, there is a Zoo, not a Botanic Garden, not an amusement park.

Good Luck!Trust me we have more houses, not chalet in nature in Romania with amazing mountain, forest, beach, plain landscapes cheaper and cleaner than this "resort". For us was a waste of time and money.

But our group had a special request to omit the exotic food apart. So then they brought us to this dark place, so dark we couldn't see anything. It's apparently meant for us to step into the world of the visually handicapped. So obviously we were scared of the unknown because the guide kept scaring us, giving non definite answers and suggestive of scary elements inside. But after the maze we realize there was nothing to be scared actually, it's their facilitation that made us scared! Well done! Then after the experience, we were supposed to eat in the dark too!They gave us normal food but our skeptism keeps scaring ourself for nothing!Overall wonderful experience, I never knew about this. The rest of the trips are adrenaline activities like Reverse Bungee and Megazip. Defnitely have to try Monster Day Tours!

Surprisingly not popular with tourists.

Too much money minded!Food was average, not to my liking, but drinks were average priced and I liked their bartending. All the cocktails were on point for us. Pity the live band, I think it's called Sounds of Enigma, to be playing in such a lousy environment. Small stage noisy speakers. BUT WONDERFUL band! Makes my day! Was my reunion with Army Friends so they special played our favourite songs! Got some of us dancing to the beat! Had so much fun but the restaurant ruined it!

The indoor rainforest is amazing and a must even if your not into gardens. I would also recommend paying $12 to go up the large tree to the roof bar as this has great views and your entry fee gives you a soft drink.

The aircraft are great having used a selection of A380s and a 777. That for me is about as good as my review will be. Ive never flown with such low level in flight services before. Drink services are very few. 2 in a 7 hour flight and that's been the same on all 6 flights. I've stopped taking the in flight meal as they are just not appealing. Last one was Perch fish? On a recent trip from Singapore to Dubai the male cabin crew war just rude and adrubt which I think is so unnecessary. I was considering travelling business class but would be concerned the service could be as poor. I am now considering other airlines direct from Heathrow. I don't find Emirates comparable to BA or Virgin. Etihad have always been superb

Firstly I want to point out the good pointOutstanding helpful courteous staff. They really can't do enough for you.Buffet food was good with a good choice.Pools were nice and lots of sun beds and umbrellas.Good gardens well keptThis is a resort and is quite large so lots of room to move around.Bad pointsRooms. We had an ocean view delux room. The room had worn out carpet. The mirror in the bathroom was all water damaged. I guess the damage was caused by the powerful water pressure in the taps below the mirror. Every time you put the tap on it blasted water all over the mirror and counter top. In general the rooms were very out dated.The rooms aren't very sound proof so a good night sleep can be difficult. Corridor noise is quite bad.The building looked like it needed a good painting but I understand that it's not easy to do with the hot climate and sand. In all I only stayed there as a stop over for 3 nights on my way back to the UK from Asia. It was a cheap all inclusive deal so I can't complain too much. I might think differently though if I was on a 2 week holiday. All inclusive doesn't mean all inclusive as well. There are many places where eating will be extra and a lot of drinks charge extra.

Steve C|3E37BEF1B6C060AA04AE88BD96A0C99A|Hotel|Ras Al Khaimah: Waldorf Astoria Ras Al Khaimah|5| “Currently on vacation at this amazing hotel”|review_418852352|I am currently at this hotel until Sunday 18th September. This was our first visit to this part of the world. Normally we stay at a luxury all inclusive resort in Cancun Mexico but decided to try something new. I'll make my review as to the point as possible.Hotel rooms = Amazing. Beautiful decor of a very high standard. Beds are very comfortable and a good size.View from room = Superb ocean front room. Massive balcony with comfortable seating for 2Room Service = Great efficient polite serviceMaid/ room cleaning service = Brilliant. They even called me on a number of occasions across the landing to make sure I was happy with the room and if there was anything I needed.Pool Staff at the main pool = All of these guys are amazing. They are extremely attentive and make sure you have a regular supply of water to drink. Very friendly and I would point out very hard working people. Food = We are half board so have only eaten in the Quasar. The staff are brilliant and the quality of the food is superb. If you like curry style dishes there is something new every night and they will also cater for special requests. The staff are all very attentive, polite and helpful.Front desk and concierge = Brilliant, polite helpful. Nothing is too much for them. They arranged for us to have a driver for the day to go site seeing in Dubai.Swimming pools = there are 2 pools. The main family pool and a smaller adult only pool. I only spent time at the main family pool as it was much larger and had a more open feel to it. Also lots of cover and palm trees to get out of the sun when you need too. A point though. If you like peace and quiet there are times in the day that this pool will be extremely noisey with children playing and screaming. I found that it's quiet before 10 and gets very noisy between 10 and 1. It then quietens down again until around 4pm where it's very noisy again until around 6pm. Sun beds = getting a sun bed at this resort is not a problem so you don't have to get up early to get one and the staff manage the sunbeds really well making sure that if they don't see someone using it they remove the towels ready for someone else to use. Most other hotels should learn from the Waldorf that managing sunbeds brings customers back to the resort.The Beach = lovely clean sandy beach with a massive number of sunbeds and parasols. There is also a designated swimming area with life guards. There is also a water sports area for extra costs. If you like snorkelling like me I found there isn't much to see. The water is very clear but this is a man made beach so not on a reef. You might see the odd fish if you are lucky. Temperature = Hot. Extremely hot so make sure you take good sun protection.Wifi = If like me you are a Hilton Honors member you can get a free wifi pass. There are also public wifi areas in the resort.If like me you like fast cars the hotel has a range of Lamborginis but to drive and experience these you need to be a Hilton Honors member and have booked a royal suite. I'll keep dreaming. In all the hotel is just fantastic as are the staff. I can honestly say the only thing I've found hard is at times the noise levels have been too loud when you are trying to relax but this can happen anywhere you go.I would strongly recomend this hotel to anyone and would like to stay again in the future. I would highly recommend both Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah as brilliant holiday destinations.

I wasn't sure what to expect. The menu was quite large and varied. We were well looked after. We all had 3 courses. The food was good quality. The location itself is also very different in as far as it's like a tent type structure. The temperature inside was very comfortable even though it was snowing outside. A really nice touch was at the end of the evening they bought trays of sweets and a selection of Gruppa to the table. I will be going back on future visits.

I'm not sure how to sum the hotel up. It's a strange set up. Basically it's a hotel on top of a shopping mall surrounded by wasteland. I'm not knocking the hotel it just seems to be in a strange location. The hotel staff were very polite. Reception was good, the bar was very nice and the bar man was very helpful and friendly. Breakfast did seem a bit chaotic but they looked rushed off their feet. The breakfast range wasn't huge but you could find something. The rooms were very nice but what spoilt it was the noise levels. You could hear everything from room to room and the corridor noise was very loud continually waking me throughout each night of my 3 night stay.
Steve C|3E37BEF1B6C060AA04AE88BD96A0C99A|Restaurant|London: The Wine Bar|4| “Lovely visit”|review_247877786|We visited here in January 2015. I've not been before and wasn't sure what to expect. We opted for the flight of wine and selections of cheese. The staff were very good and really knew about the wine. They made me a flight based on my favourite wine that was a perfect accompaniment. The cheeses were very nice. I would recommend a visit there for something different. Price was ok for the quality and setting. Also there was no rushing so it was a nice relaxing break from the sales in London.

It was a really nice trip. The journey started at the pier by the Tower of London and went all the way upto The houses of parliament. Although it was a dark day the boat was very nicely fitted out and clean. The tea was very good and great value for money. It was approx £25 per head. The staff were very good and brought frequent refills of tea or coffee. The cakes and sandwiches were also good. The trip took approx 2 hours. I would recommend this to anyone.
Steve C|3E37BEF1B6C060AA04AE88BD96A0C99A|Restaurant|London: Floridita|5| “Excellent night out”|review_247874059|We visited this place for our friend birthday party on Sat 3rd Jan 2015. What an excellent evening. The location is great, very close to all the other nightlife and attractions. The food was excellent value. 3 courses in soho for £38 per person is superb. The food was really good. The staff service was excellent. The cocktails were the best I've ever had especially the Mojito. I was also extremely impressed with the live band and the Salsa dancing. As a musician myself I can say the quality of the music was outstanding and very enjoyable. I'm not a dancer but gave it a go. Everyone had a great evening. I would recommend this to anyone especially if you are looking for something different.
Steve C|3E37BEF1B6C060AA04AE88BD96A0C99A|Hotel|Crawley: Sofitel London Gatwick|5| “Company Christmas Party”|review_242153127|I stayed at this hotel on the 29th November as part of our companies Christmas party. It was great. On check in the staff were polite and sorted our room very quickly. We had a great room on the 8th floor looking out onto the airport. The rooms were comfortable, quiet and had great views. We also had a complimentary mini bar and access to Club Sofitel on the top floor. The Christmas party was very good. The Christmas dinner was very nice. I have many overseas colleagues who stay here on a regular basis and they all say how much they like staying there. On the morning of checkout I had a complimentary breakfast in the Club lounge. Again this was very nice and the staff member was very attentive and helpful. I thoroughly recommend this hotel.
Steve C|3E37BEF1B6C060AA04AE88BD96A0C99A|Restaurant|Dusseldorf: Hacienda Real|2| “Business meal”|review_239769986|We ate at this place on arrival for Medica 2014. The staff were not very friendly. As a visitor to Mexico every year I know a good Mexican meal and I'm afraid this just didn't meet my expectations. I had the fajitas as I thought it would be authentic and not the Texmex version. What I got was a cross between the 2. Chicken covered in some sauce that I didn't recognise. Biggest put off was the wraps. Normally in Mexico the wraps are small but these were more like small rings of uncooked doe. Not very nice. Price is excessive for the quality.
Steve C|3E37BEF1B6C060AA04AE88BD96A0C99A|Restaurant|Dusseldorf: Space Burger|2| “Fast meal”|review_239769039|I ate in space burger last night after a long day at Medica. All I wanted was a gourmet burger which I expected from this place. Unfortunately that's not what we got. The burger was full of gristle and I doubt was made on site. To make matters worse we then found out they only take cash and no credit cards
Steve C|3E37BEF1B6C060AA04AE88BD96A0C99A|Hotel|Dusseldorf: Best Western Savoy Hotel|4| “Business visit for Medica 2014”|review_239768785|I had to boom a last minute business trip to Medica in Dusseldorf which is a massive trade fair. Due to the lateness in booking I didn't have very many options but really needed to stay close. I found this hotel. I wasn't impressed with some of the reviews from other people but have to say it wasn't bad. Yes the decor is very outdated and they don't have much in the way of faculties but for me the most important things are polite staff, clean well maintained rooms and a room that is quite. This hotel delivered all of them. I would stay there again but have to say that I think the price of £371 per night is rather excessive even when there's a trade fair on. I could have stayed in a 5 star London hotel for less

He said they were known for their salads and he wasn't wrong. I had a chicken salad and it was huge. Beautifully presented with chicken, olive oil and Italian bread. I've been trying to find an Italian restaurant in England that can compete but so far have failed to find one. I would recommend this place to anyone. Service was also superb.

Very busy but that's Friday in Central London. I was very impressed by the choices of beers available. The staff were very helpful in recommending what to try as there were well over 100 beers to try. The interior is also and interesting layout. There is also an outside area.
Steve C|3E37BEF1B6C060AA04AE88BD96A0C99A|Restaurant|London: Browns Brasserie & Bar Covent Garden|4| “Nice night out”|review_233519360|I recently visited Browns for a Management night out. The location is very good. The restaurant is huge inside. The Friday we visited it was very busy. They have a nice menu and the service for our table of 12 was very good. All courses arrived together and were hot and of a high standard. If you want somewhere a bit different give it a try.

I wasn't sure what to expect from seeing the outside. I was very pleasantly surprised. I had no idea each building housed a scene from the war. Great attention to detail and not forgetting smellovision where the scene rooms had war time smells pumped into the. The kids loved it and I would recommend to people of any age.

I've been visiting Chessington since I was a child in the 70s so have seen many changes during this time. The park is appealing to younger children but I find that it's great as a family day out. Unfortunately at certain times of the year the queues are not so good but nowhere near as bad as Thorpe Park. Getting out of the park at the end of the day can be a nightmare.
Steve C|3E37BEF1B6C060AA04AE88BD96A0C99A|Attractions|Chertsey: THORPE PARK Resort|2| “No good value for money”|review_232935836|I have just let my Merlin annual pass run out. The main reason for this is Thorpe park. During the past year since taking the annual pass out my children being teenagers wanted to go to Thorpe Park ore than the other parks and attractions on offer. There's nothing wrong with the rides but there comes a point when there is no point in visiting. The queues are horrendous as is the behaviour of the average person visiting the park. It's a shame as they have some really good rides. My biggest issue is with the is how poorly managed the queues are. Thorpe park really don't understand the concept of fast passes either. Having travelled to different theme parks all over the world I understand that fast passes are there to help you make the most of your day. Unfortunately Thorpe park see this as an opportunity to make more money out of you. Personally I think this is extremely unfair and this is the main reason why I cancelled my 8 person annual membership.

It was very nice inside, not over packed and the bar man made some excellent cocktails. Not to badly priced either.
Steve C|3E37BEF1B6C060AA04AE88BD96A0C99A|Hotel|Lower Beeding: South Lodge Hotel|5| “Business use”|review_232751070|This hotel is beautiful inside and out. Rooms are of a very high standard. Grounds are stunning especially in the summer when you can use the terrace. The new wings are very sympathetic to the original building. As you walk around the hotel you can see the attention to detail and expense that has been spent. It truly is stunning. The staff are very courteous and polite and always greet you with a smile and a good morning afternoon or evening. I've eaten in one of the restaurants with business colleagues and can say they food was excellent. I would recommend South Lodge to anyone looking for a quiet get away place.
Steve C|3E37BEF1B6C060AA04AE88BD96A0C99A|Restaurant|Crawley: Gatwick Manor|4| “Great place for lunch”|review_232749926|Gatwick Manor is one of the last unspoilt old buildings left in Crawley. I can remember my parents taking me there on special occasions back in the 1980s. It's still there now and pretty much as I remembered it with all it's period features. I can recommend lunch there. Good lunchtime menu and excellent value for money. Service is always good and there is a nice garden area to eat in the better weather.

The only thing I would say is good are the cocktails which are very good but also very expensive. There are other places in Crawley running 2 for 1 offers.The biggest let down is poor service and poor food especially taking into account how expensive eating there is. The staff expect tips but don't want to put the service level in, unlike TGIs in the USA. It's not somewhere I would recommend.

I thought it would be nice to write a short review. It's simple, if you want a nice Chinese meal or take away in Crawley Happy Meeting is the place to go. I recently took my son and friends there for his 21st birthday. As there were so many of us they recommended the all you can eat which was well worth the money. Everyone ordered 2 dishes each and the table was loaded with more than enough food. The food is very good and the service from the staff was also excellent. Great choice on the menu.

They have a nice choice available on the menu and the food is not bad. Calzone is a favourite of mine which I can recommend. The setting is nice and modern. My only real issue is the service which isn't the greatest.
Steve C|3E37BEF1B6C060AA04AE88BD96A0C99A|Restaurant|Crawley: Smith & Western|1| “Overpriced appalling service”|review_232652807|I have eaten at all but 1 of their 5 restaurants. I can honestly say I am extremely disappointed with the one at Tilgate Park. They should have it all going for them, great location just what was needed in Tilgate park but unfortunately they are let down by the followingPoor managementPoorly behaved staffOverpriced food that is nothing like the Smith and Westerns I remember from previous visits. It's a shame as I have been eating in them since they only had Horsham and Chichester but following what I've seen at Tilgate I won't recommend them to anyone again.
Steve C|3E37BEF1B6C060AA04AE88BD96A0C99A|Restaurant|Crawley: Cinnamon Indian Restaurant|5| “My Friday treat”|review_232652096|This place is a treasure. They have a huge menu so there is something for everyone. The food is of a very high standard. The staff are of the highest standard and are extremely polite and attentive to customers. I have used both the eat in services and also use the takeaway service every Friday. In my opinion this is the best place in Crawley to get a curry.

So decided to give a shot. Place is a little difficult to find. This has a small staircase to go on top. It has limited place so better do reservation in advance. They serve South American food. Service is quick. Each dish has substantial quantity so order carefully. Owner and staff are very attentive. Overall, a bit different place with bit different taste.

The place is decorated with war time items. It doesn't have air conditioning. Food is great. Quantity of each dish is more than enough. At the end they serve complimentary dessert. Overall nice restaurant with great taste. Do your reservation before going there. Most of the time the place is full with waiting period.

Has almost all the major brands in hotels. Has maximum number of malls on this road. But most of them are very expensive. Although you don't want to buy anything as a tourist just visit this place as a good hangout place.

It has both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements. We had dinner 3 times in a week here. Everytime they maintained the quality and didn't disappoint us. Although have very few options in menu but whatever they serve, serve with a smile and taste. We tried chicken biryani, methi malai mutter, Dal tadka. So overall good place for indian food.

Take online ticket. One can reach there by MRT then by shuttle or Sentosa express or by walk. Less frequency of Sentosa Express makes it inefficient. So better take a walk or shuttle bus from Vivo city. Most of the rides in Universal studio are suitable for family and are mild, except Revenge of the Mummy and Battlestar Galactica gray track. Don't miss transformer 3D battle. Single rider entry saves queue time. Overall Universal studios is a fun day for a family with young children.

I never had a night safari experience so I planned to visit this place. You can see most of the animals in Singapore zoo as well and can see them properly in day time. We just had tram ride and came back. In case you want to have a different experience you can opt for night safari. Otherwise in my opinion Singapore Zoo is enough if you are with kids.

The most important thing about the Singapore zoo is, most of the animals are not in a cage. Zoo is designed to make it as natural as possible. If you have kids with you and want to explore the zoo completely then one full day is required. My son enjoyed the zoo and shows very much. You can get trolleys on rent. Be ready to walk as tram ride is not enough to explore zoo completely. Don't miss Zoo-ruasic Park. I booked the tickets from Klook.Com with a good deal. You can redeem the voucher from automatic ticket machine. This saves money and time.

Nearest MRT is Somerset which is 10 mins away. Bus stop is just 3 mins away. Front desk allowed my parents to check in around 9AM. All the staff here is very helpful and welcoming. Breakfast is good enough to fill your stomach. It's difficult to satisfy test buds of each visitor. But I found it good as my parents and kid enjoyed it. Chef Ram and his team is excellent. Room size is good enough. Nothing great about view as it is surrounded by buildings all around. Overall great value for money.

It is located a hour drive from district 1. There are many tour operators who can take you there. It takes atleast a half day to explore this place. If you have a guide with you then he will explain you all the tricks used by VietCong in detail. Don't miss to actually go thru the tunnel.

I choose this hotel because it was located nearby KL Sentral area and room price was competitive compared to other hotels in that area. Hotel can improve their check in process. Rooms are OK. Breakfast is disappointing and staff at breakfast area is not so welcoming. Overall average hotel with better location advantage.

We had enjoyed it's food in Ho chi Minh City district 1. So I had same expectations from this restaurant too, this restaurant also satisfy your taste buds. Only disappointment was that it doesn't provide wheat roti. Naan size is very big so be careful while ordering it. Overall good food with decent taste.

But this definitely value for money if you are with kids. Kids have many options like small rides, game zone, aquarium, water park. For adults it might be bit disappointment as this park does not have many options and whatever it has is not thrilling. The best part I liked about this park is its water park. Many options for kids and adults. Park also provides free bus service to and fro town. Overall nice place to enjoy a day with family.

Being an Indian traveling with a kid this hotel provided me many options for breakfast. Another reason why I liked is just across the street there is an Indian restaurant which is also best in city as per me. Overall great Hotel with value for money.

If you take room which has river view then you can enjoy the evening view of river front and the cable strayed bridge.Bad part is this hotel doesn't have its own restaurant. We need to go out at a cafe right next to hotel. Although the cafe is an excellent place but still it's a inconvenience in my opinion.

The USP of this hotel is its location at very competitive price. Just get out of the hotel and you will find yourself in most livelier area of the city. Staff is very helpful. Only concern is they provide limited quantity breakfast with limited menu option, the area where they can improve. Just opposite to the hotel one can find excellent Indian restaurant. So overall nice budget hotel at excellent location.

Resort has good room inventory as it is the biggest property of Sterling. Entire Property is well maintained. There are many places in resort where one can enjoy the beautiful nature and view. Restaurant is good. It has live kitchen. Resort also provides travel desk facility which is nice and reliable.Overall I enjoyed my stay in this resort and would love to visit again.

We ordered chapati, chicken chettinad and chicken dum biryani. Chapati size is big enough for a person. Biryani also serves for two people. So rates are reasonable compared to quantity. Service is excellent. Ambience is also good. Overall nice place which satisfies all your expectations.
Yogesh0304|537BF18F0408F20834FE5B1DB1A9018D|Attractions|Lonavala: Bhushi Dam|3| “An Over hyped place”|review_302425522|This is an over hyped place. There are many other better places around. This place is normally crowded in monsoon days, both weekdays and weekends. Place is definitely not suitable for a family.
Yogesh0304|537BF18F0408F20834FE5B1DB1A9018D|Restaurant|Lonavala: Kailash Parbat|3| “Very Costly”|review_302424095|We visited this place for having our dinner. We tried the outside fast food section of Kailash Parbat. Taste is good but very costly. One glass of juice was of Rs.167. So I found this place not worth. There are many other better and economical options out there.
Yogesh0304|537BF18F0408F20834FE5B1DB1A9018D|Attractions|Lonavala: Celebrity Wax Museum|3| “Nice Attempt”|review_302423023|Congratulations for attempting. It is a first of a kind experiment in Maharashtra as far as I know. Few statues are excellent like Anna Hazare, A R Rehman and Yashwantrao Chavan but few are very average like Angelina Jolie, Jackey Shroff and Charlie Chaplin. Lighting arrangements should be improved. Overall there is a great scope for improvement to make it of an international standard.
Yogesh0304|537BF18F0408F20834FE5B1DB1A9018D|Hotel|Lonavala: Lonavala - Under the Over, A Sterling Holidays Resort|3| “More Hotel Less Resort”|review_302420244|It’s more of a hotel than resort. Although it has a Swimming pool, garden and few indoor games but it is not sufficient for a 40+ room resort when it is completely occupied. It doesn’t have any scenery around in any direction. You have to go out around city to enjoy the nature. Service is nice. Cleanliness should be improved. Restaurant is very average. Overall its OK resort, and not a must visit.

The picture of Kalavantin Fort looks scary if you see it before visiting it actually. But if you are a regular trekker then it is not at all scary. It will be bit difficult for beginners, but it is definitely a must visit for all trekkers who are looking for an adventure on trek.

You will surely miss it, unless you really looking for it. Bit smaller place but neat and clean. Nice service, good food. We tried chicken platter, Murg Dum Wazwan style, house speciality chicken curry and Dum Biryani. Out of these only house of speciality chicken curry was not up to the mark. Rest food was excellent.
Yogesh0304|537BF18F0408F20834FE5B1DB1A9018D|Restaurant|Pune: SP's Biryani|4| “Best place for Biryani Lovers”|review_230226906|I had heard of this restaurant many times. Last week I visited this hotel. It is right in front of SP College. You won’t find parking so easily here.It is a nice big clean and spacious restaurant. It has a separate floor for family.Speciality of this restaurant is Biryani. I tested Chicken Dum Biryani in pure ghee. It was really excellent. Finally my search for a good biryani in Pune ended here. I recommend this restaurant especially for Biryani lovers. The place is bit expensive compared to other restaurants but I found it worth.
Yogesh0304|537BF18F0408F20834FE5B1DB1A9018D|Hotel|Pune: Hotel Kshitij|4| “Worth”|review_226230400|I visited Kshitij Hotel in March’14. It is an apartment hotel with a good room size. Room Tariff is normal. Room has a small kitchen with a small refrigerator. Hygiene is ok, can be improved.Hotel only provides breakfast in the morning but it has very limited options in menu. There is one restaurant on top floor which is not part of hotel but they do provide room service. But it is available only for lunch and dinner. Also the building has a bar cum discotheque on top floor. This disturbs you as noise continues till late night.Overall this is a good place for a short stay.
Yogesh0304|537BF18F0408F20834FE5B1DB1A9018D|Hotel|Lonavala: MTDC Karla|4| “Value for Money”|review_226225131|I had visited this place twice and this place never disappointed me. We can book the rooms only through online mode. Room tariff is reasonable. Resort is well maintained considering it is managed by government agency. Room allocation is a smooth process.Room size is good. Each room has a good parking area and we can take our car upto our room. Hygiene standard is Ok and there is a scope for improvement. Staffs are supporting and quick. Resort has Kids play area, Water Park and few options of water sports for entertainment. Water park and water sport have separate entry fee.Resort has a restaurant inside. It is decent one and gives good options in menu. Only issue with restaurant is, it takes almost an hour for order delivery. So we used to go quite early for our lunch and dinner to get food on time. Resort has bit odd check in and check out timings. We have to vacate rooms by 9 AM.In conclusion, I find this resort as ‘Value for money’ and I would definitely visit this place again in future.
Yogesh0304|537BF18F0408F20834FE5B1DB1A9018D|Hotel|Pune: Mantra Resort Pune|3| “Not worth”|review_226218998|We had visited Mantra Resort in April'14 with a group of 17 people. Mantra is a decent property but not well maintained. Cottages are located quite far from reception. Mantra has provided vans for internal transportation. Cottage has a hall, a bedroom with attached toilet and a small kitchen. They have made bedroom size very small. A family of 4 can be accommodated if they provide AC in hall too. Room was not clean and I found one frog in toilet. It is quite common in Mantra Resort.Food is good. They give good options in buffet. Electricity is a big problem in Mantra Resort. Water Park and swimming pool were not opening as electricity was not there. Water Park size is small, swimming pool size is ok.Resorts have many options for entertainment. Shooting, dart, camel and bullock cart ride etc. Evening shows are good. Magic show is very ordinary.Overall NOT a value for money place. I may not visit Mantra again.

It may be difficult to find if you are not familiar with the area. There is limited car parking and this may be an issue when busy. Luckily we visited the day before the long weekend. We had a great table on the balcony overlooking the spectacular harbour. The menu had choices for most tastes and kids selections as well. The service was very friendly from all the staff and the meals arrived quickly with the kids served first.

Our Uber driver that picked us up from the airport said he did not have a passport, but I think he just did not want to sit at the border. So we needed to switch to a another vehicle to complete the trip.We booked a Lego-land Hotel and theme park package and were very impressed. On arrival the hotel entry and reception is spectacular with huge Lego themed play areas. The themed rooms are also equally spectacular with lots of fun things to do including safe cracking with a Lego surprise. Our room overlooked both the theme and water park. The breakfast buffet was equal to any 5 star hotel we have stayed at and the service was friendly and efficient. The hotel also has a nice supervised roof top pool with shade sails.We planned to spend 2 days at Legoland but probably needed 3. The theme park is awesome for young kids and our teenager even had a ball. The park is huge with lots of Lego models everywhere as well as many great rides and rollercoasters all designed for younger (Not Thrill Seeking) riders. The adjoining water park was also very good with lots of great slides, wave pool, drifting river etc.The meals and drinks in the park were reasonably priced but if you need more choice there is a shopping mall just outside the entry with lots of local restaurants and take away. There are also ATMs in the park and the mall.

We visited on a normal weekday in the late afternoon and the rides had anticipated wait times in excess of an hour. With the few hours we had planned to stay we would be lucky if we got to ride 3 attractions. It appears that this is normal as the queues were designed to hold hundreds of people with in queue entertainment. The rides we did experience were very well done and the park was very clean. It was extremely hot on the day of our visit and some of the queues were very uncomfortable even with the fans. We got very poor value for our money and they should offer half day tickets and much cheaper prices for young kids.
Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Attractions|Jetstar Airways - Australia & New Zealand|3| “Love the 787 Dreamliner but hate the Jetstar booking website”|review_457220761|The Jetstar booking website is terrible and its designed to mislead and rip you off. I thought the ACCC had instructed Jetstar to fix this? When trying to book flights and add-ons for 5 people we constantly ended up with the wrong inclusions. We wanted meals and entertainment but never selected additional insurances, donations to the needy or FF points upgrades. I was so disgusted at the website that I switched to Scoot airlines, but as I did not want an overnight flight I had to persist with Jetstar. It took hours to finally complete the booking but even when completed the paid for inclusions were not listed. After several online chats and phone calls Jetstar advised that we will get what we paid for even without the correct documentation. The prices we ended up paying for these Budget Airline flights were almost the same as Qantas and Emirates with all inclusions and if they had better times I would have switched. Budget only refers to service!We arrived at the airport with 2.5 hours to spare which should have been plenty of time but were immediately confronted with a huge queue which turned out to be for Jetstar only. Once we got closer to the end of the line the 2 check in desks were reduced to one and a single clerk was left to check in hundreds of passengers. Once checked in we were told to rush straight to the boarding gate as the flight is about to board, but the flight was actually delayed a further 30 minutes due to the disastrous check in delays. Where was the management?The new 787 Dreamliner aircraft is very comfortable and quite (85db at rotation). I paid extra for the exit row and this was worth it for my long legs. The TV and table all fold into the arm rest so the exit row seats do not compromise any services. The windows have the cool electronic shades that you press a button for clear or tint. There appeared to be plenty of overhead storage and the entertainment system was very good with a huge range of options. Ear buds are supplied with the usual 2-1 pin adapter but I would recommend taking noise cancelling headsets for a better experience. The entire flight was very smooth even when we appeared to dodge some tropical weather, the only rough handling was on autopilot disconnect prior to landing. Captains announcements were few and far between and could have prevented a few gasps and startled passengers when it appeared we were on a collision course with what look like 2 nearby airbuses. We entered a holding pattern just prior to Changi approach and as we turned outbound an aircraft above and below appeared to be on converging paths. I am sure it was just a normal holding pattern stack but a bit of warning would have been nice. It would have looked spectacular from the cockpit and it’s the closet I have ever seen another jet in flight.The return trip also got off to a bad start with the stupid automated check in kiosks failing to print all the baggage tags. We then had to try and get assistance and finally get some-one to manually print the missing tags. These stupid kiosks need staff on hand to render assistance but instead you have to leave the kiosk unattended mid booking and line up in a help queue. There appeared to be a problem at the boarding gate and security screening had to be halted, this created a huge back up of passengers and another late boarding. Once finally on-board we were advised that a connecting Jetstar flight from Bangkok was late and the paperwork (Manifest?) would need to altered. Why did this take 45 minutes to fix? The return flight was a red eye and the cabin was chilled after the meal service, but after boarding with only tropical clothing many passengers complained of the cold. I went and asked for blankets for the family but was told I would have to pay $75 for a few tiny blankets worth about $2 each!The paid for meals were hit and miss with some of the hot dishes quiet tasty but the breakfast was a joke with a tasteless dry crumbly muffin and a fake orange juice. My neighboring passengers and many others on board brought their own messy food and subways but this results in people eating and with trays down at inappropriate times creating a safety hazard.
Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Hotel|Sentosa Island: Siloso Beach Resort Sentosa|4| “Much better than expected and excellent for family's.”|review_456801051|We has trouble booking accommodation on Sentosa Island that would cater for a family of 5. Most resorts wanted to split the family over 2 rooms with a very high price tag to match. We found the Siliso Beach resort on trip advisor and were hesitant to book due to the previous poor reviews, but in the end we thought it was good value for our group of 5 and were willing to accept some negatives. The Siliso Beach resort was a great surprise and exceeded our expectations. It is an ethical family resort with an environmental theme and employing some disabled staff. The resort is almost hidden from view with the dense plantings and trees.Room Our stay was in a 5 share room which was supposed to have 5 beds as per the agreed emails, On arrival there was confusion with the booking and the resort wanted to charge extra for the roll away bed. Our 2 smallest just shared a bed instead. The bedroom and bathroom were roomy, with basic decorations and included a flat screen TV. The view from our room was over the spectacular beach but the windows were a little dirty due to all the greenery. The shower was an odd set up and not positioned over the bath so it flooded the bathroom. The bathroom and toilet had black glass doors and the washbasin was in the general living area. A previous guest appears to have applied messy masking tape for additional privacy and this had not been cleaned. High in the resort were hidden Villas and I would have like to check these out.RestaurantThe Siliso Resort has an indoor / outdoor beachside (almost) restaurant and the buffet breakfast was good quality with your typical hot and cold offerings of a middle standard hotel. Breakfast was fun with visits from the peacocks, squirrels, geckos and other locals. We did not try the evening meals at Siliso as there is a huge range of restaurants, bars and cafes with great choices nearby.PoolThe Siliso Resort has an awesome “cool water” meandering spring water lagoon pool within a jungle type setting, waterfall, waterplay area and built in slides, with several shallow areas suitable for toddlers. There are plenty of shady lounges around the pool and rubber car tubes for floating around. The main lagoon is quite deep so keep an eye on toddlers.GardensThe resort has fantastic shady tropical gardens with a huge variety of interesting plants, a worm farm, and a roof top vegetable garden all maintained with conservation and sustainability in mind. BeachThe beaches are protected from surf and windy weather by the outer islets and there is safe supervised swimming in a netted area. The beaches are also lined with great bars and eateries and you can watch the kids play in the water while enjoying a beer.Activities The Siliso resort area on Sentosa Island has a huge range of fun activities and too many to list. This was our second visit to Sentosa and we still have not seen everything this amazing island has to offer. On this trip we went indoor skydiving used the downhill luge with chairlift, visited Universal studios (Expensive), and just explored.Wi-FiI purchased a local sim card so I did not need the in house WiFi and cannot comment on its quality.Billing and check out.Apart from the bedding confusion the billing, check in and check out were all seamless, professional and helpful, but I wouldn’t say overly friendly. In Summary we would stay at this resort again because the positives far outweigh the quirky inconveniences. Note that taxis and Uber have a lot of difficulty finding the resorts hidden reception area in the Sentosa maze.

We finally had another opportunity to try the Teller in its new location in Shepparton without kids. The staff are very well trained and provided excellent service. Our meals were good but not great, but this may have been due to my tendency to try new things. We needed to leave by 9-pm to pick up the kids and we managed to squeeze in 3 courses and wine. The only disappointment was some dirty cutlery. Hope to try again soon.

The menu sounded good but the presentation and taste was lacking. The prices were very expensive, probably due to the excellent location. The service was quick and friendly but Falls creek has many great restaurant options and due to the poor value and bland food we would not visit the Be Food store again.

UNDERSTATEMENT! We were offered plastic bags to cover our shoes which lasted about 2 minutes. The mud was everywhere, deep and unavoidable and curiously they had thrown branches into the mess as if that might help. After ruining the kids shoes we quit exploring and had some lunch. The cafe has great food at reasonable prices and the staff are very friendly. Its a pity the mud ruined our experience as it could have been easily fixed with a few barrow loads of gravel. Its interesting to note that previous reviews from months ago have also mentioned the mud but still nothing has been done to address the problem.

Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Hotel|Falls Creek: Trackers Mountain Lodge|5| “Best Service at Falls Creek”|review_390971645|ServiceWell this is no secret and just like all the other reviews, I agree that Trackers service is outstanding and it makes the difference between an OK trip or a great holiday. I have never had such friendly, professional service at any ski resort hotel. It starts with the greeting at the door, bags carried to your room, tour of the facilities and Brian always has plenty of time for a chat. All the staff are genuinely friendly and appear to enjoy their work and looking after the guest experience. We look forward to our next stay at Trackers and hope the information below may assist other families planning a stay.LocationThe lodge is at the top of the village with a great view and at the end of a road with very little skier or snowmobile traffic. Unless you are super fit and love lugging bags uphill you will need the expensive “Over-Snow” monopoly to get to and from the lodge with your bags.Ski in – Ski OutThe top of village location gives you more ski out options than most other lodges. You can turn left and ski the easy roads through the village to the Halley’s Comet and Gully chairlift or turn right and ski a steeper track to the village bowl with the Eagle and Summit chair lifts. The return at the end of the day is a little trickier and not suitable for beginners with some narrow chutes and a flat 100-meter skate. Although our kids managed the home trails well, they have been skiing a few years. Beginners staying at the lodge can access the free skier shuttle service from the Halley’s Comet ski lift area.Ski LockerA drying room with plenty of hanging space, boot hooks and chairs for boot fitting was on the ground floor with an adjacent ski locker room locate at the bottom of an outdoor flight of stairs that accessed the ski-able road above. The ski room was locked after hours for security. These stairs were a pain for the unfit, especially when carrying several loads of kids gear up and down at the start and end of each ski day. RoomWe had a panorama room with a view to the village bowl and a newly renovated bathroom. The room had a King size double bed and good quality safe and solid wooden bunks. The flat screen TV was oddly placed over the top bunk but it all worked OK. Our first 2 nights in the room were cold but after the heater had been running a couple of days the room warmed up OK. Robes were provided as well as a range of toiletries. The room did not have a fridge but plenty of wardrobe space, drawers and an alarm clock.SpaA spa and sauna room was available between 3 and pm. When the spa blowers were operating the room fogged up and could benefit from better ventilation.RestaurantThe standard package at Trackers included cooked and continental breakfast, afternoon tea and amazing 7 course themed dinners such as 80's, Comfort food, Degustation and Christmas in July. It’s great to share tables and meet other guests in the cozy setting. The kids would have an early separate dinner with all their meal favorites. Lunch is not included but many restaurants and cafes with a great variety of cuisines are scattered throughout the village for easy access when skiing.Kids ClubThe kids had a play room with TV, Games, Billiards etc. and each night the fantastic kids club hosts would look after the kids with great activities while the adults enjoyed a long dinner. LoungeThe lounge, bar and restaurant are all the same room at Trackers with a large flat screen playing ski movies of course and a nice open fire to sit around with a beer in hand. There is a balcony attached to the lounge for a great view of the fireworks on Thursday nights.

The staff have all been friendly and very helpful so far this year. The only bad service so far this year at Falls Creek has been the Lift Company's Cloud 9 restaurant with arrogant counter staff, bad attitudes, bland food and some staff in tears!! Get rid of the big egos they have no place in hospitality.

I had a very large, 2 room unit with kitchenette, lounge, desk and table. The bathroom was very old fashioned with a shower over the bath and a shower curtain, but it was clean and functional. There was a message in the room that guests would be charged if the dishes were not cleaned. I would prefer if the hotel cleaned dishes in a hot dishwasher rather than rely on the previous guests hygiene. A full breakfast was available for only $13 including cereal and cooked options, the breakfast was to big to eat most mornings. The staff were always friendly and helpful. Mobile phone reception was poor in the ground floor room.
Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Hotel|Tullamarine: Mantra Tullamarine Hotel|3| “A better experience this time.”|review_363829269|This would not be my choice of location but my work booked me into the Mantra again. On this occasion the hotel had a deal that included parking and was much better value than my last stay. I was also given a much bigger and better room with a spa. The spa was a nice treat but very small and my legs would not fit. The hotel reserved parking is on the top level and was very jam packed. The shuttle bus in the morning is friendly and runs every 10 minutes. The bus will pick you up from the same spot at the airport on your return journey, but I was looking for a shuttle bus called Mantra and they are actually named after the car park.
Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Hotel|Glenelg: Stamford Grand Adelaide|4| “Great location with a few areas for improvement.”|review_363590367|I had stayed at the Stamford many years ago and knew that it was a good location for the family on this Adelaide holiday. We tried to book directly with the hotel via their website and telephone but was advised that the hotel was booked out for our selected dates. I then checked online for other hotels nearby and many websites still came up with availability at the Stamford during our desired dates. I rang the Stamford again and told them that the website “Trivago” offered the exact room we wanted, when we wanted and at a cheaper price but we had been told by the Stamford that it was not available. I was then advised that the Stamford reserves bulk rooms exclusively for some websites. Well how dumb is that, tell your customers to go elsewhere and then offer the product to a re-seller at a lower price and pay a commission! Although surprised by the crazy business ethics I still booked the Stamford at $399.50 per night. If arriving by car the hotel reception is a little tricky to find as you need to enter via some back streets and under the multi deck car park. Once parked at the front door the friendly staff quickly unloaded our bags and delivered them to our room. The multi-level car parking is an extra charge and there is no option to park on the street as this tourist area is packed. The car park is very poorly designed with spaces shorter than most vehicles and not wide enough for most cars to open doors. Many vehicles were deliberately parked across 2 spaces to prevent damage from an adjoining vehicle. The car park had many signs warning that if you used 2 spaces or double parked the fine was $50. Even in our small hire car, I had to unload passengers before parking and then try to squeeze out of the car once parked. I definitely would not use this car park if you have an expensive vehicle.Check in was quick and our requested bed configuration was confirmed. Like many hotels today the keys are the swipe card style and are programmed to limit which floors you have access to. The swipe cards are a nuisance in the lift as the swipe occasionally failed and our floor was missed. Our ocean view room with balcony was large, clean and was set up with 2 double beds and a roll away with room to spare. The view was fantastic and looked straight out over the pier and ocean with parks and playgrounds below. The mini bar was well stocked and had a good choice of beers. We did not get the promised free WiFi that was part of our booking deal but I did not chase it up because I had my own 4G modem anyway. I note that the hotel normally charges for WiFi access which is such a rip off.Our hotel deal did not include breakfast and we paid extra for this 1 morning but found far better quality and value in some of the outstanding nearby restaurants and cafes. There was nothing wrong with the Stamford breakfast buffet but it was just your typical offering with hot and cold options, although the pancake machine had failed during our visit. We had dinner at the in house “Promenade” restaurant 1 night and this was very disappointing with just average pub quality meals. When did a bowl of mixed lettuce become a salad? The restaurant staff were very attentive, helpful and obviously well trained in hospitality and all the hotel staff we dealt with were very friendly.The beautiful swimming pool and spa are on an elevated level with an open roof, outstanding view and wrap around balcony. The pool and surrounding area was clean with lots of seating and was protected from the wind. The surrounds of the hotel are very safe for children as the beachfront and shopping area are all vehicle free zones. There is an expensive “Beach-house” play center nearby but a better option is to take the kids to the very well designed free play area in the adjoining park. We had a few minor issues during our stay that could do with some attention but nothing that would prevent us from visiting again. The compendium and hotel information is all electronic and hidden in the TV but this was difficult and time consuming to use and you needed a compendium to work out how to read the compendium. All I wanted was a check out time but it was just quicker to call the concierge. The system also locked up several times and you could not access TV at all requiring a reboot / power off. The online hotel account / bill access also did not work. The heater was difficult to adjust and most nights was set too hot for a good sleep, we found someone’s slippers under the bed and used water bottles in the wardrobe. The wardrobe doors are a silly design with both my wife and I getting our fingers caught in the poorly designed handles.
Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Attractions|Glenelg: The Beachouse|2| “Very Disappointing”|review_359951363|I read the Trip Advisor reviews and then took the kids for an afternoon. I have to agree with most reviewers that the attraction is extremely overpriced. The Beach-house was very quiet with very few patrons and staff were friendly and helpful. The package deals on offer were not good value so we just paid for individual rides and blew an obscene amount of money in non time at all. You have to buy a card upfront then pay $3 per slide per person, $10.50 per person for a jumping castle, $9.50 each for mini golf etc etc. There is a great free play area on the beach in front of the beach-house and it was packed with kids having a great time. If the Beach-house was reasonably priced we may have spent a few hours there but when you get ripped off in such a short time its hard to think of anything good to say.
Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Hotel|Brighton: Quest Brighton On The Bay|4| “Great "Last Minute" deal.”|review_322458826|I needed to stay an extra night in Melbourne and the previous hotel was booked out so I tried the last-minute website and the Brighton Quest came up as a great deal. I rang the reception and they were very friendly and helpful. The car parking is in an underground cellar and was very tight to get in and out. The room was compact with a view of the fence but I couldn't complain for the price. The TV was rigidly mounted on the wall at right angles to the foot of the bed so you couldn't watch TV comfortably in bed. The bathroom was good but the shelf with all the soap and shampoo etc is at floor level, very strange? There was no in-house restaurant and I was directed to the nearby shopping strip which had a great range of restaurants but the walk back to the hotel in the dark was not nice and I would not recommend it on your own.

The room was large with a lounge, desk, table and chairs and a nice view of the pool. The reception was friendly and helpful and the buffet breakfast was good with all the essentials. The only negative I found was carpet in the hall was worn and stained but not worth worrying about. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it based on value for money.

This is definitely our favorite place to stay at Falls Creek. The Hotel is located just a short walk from the Eagle chair lift and this is one of the best locations on the mountain when there is no ski-able snow in the village. Unfortunately we picked a lousy week for weather, it was very cold for September and blowing a gale for the whole week. We didn’t ski every day and spent a lot of time indoors. The hotel has a great lounge area, pool and spa and probably the best view on the mountain so we still enjoyed our non-skiing time. The highlight of any stay at the Falls creek Hotel is always the food. Make sure that you always get the package including Dinner, you will be amazed at the quality of these 4 course meals. I had friends stay for a few nights and they were amazed at the great location, food and value for money.

The restaurant is in the middle of the village, so its not easy to get to when the snow is average. The large central open fire is a great feature. The service was very friendly and the menu was interesting. The meals were good but for the price there are better value options nearby.

The village at Falls is cosy, easy to walk around at night, has a great selection of restaurants and is protected from bad weather and howling gales. Its a beautiful place even during a blizzard. But the car parking is terrible, if you are staying in one of the many lodges that require over-snow transport to deliver your family and all your gear, be prepared to throw away another hundred dollars and wait up to an hour to park you car before you will finally arrive at your lodge.

Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Hotel|Falls Creek: Feathertop Alpine Lodge|3| “Budget accommodation with great staff..”|review_306252006|We stayed at the Feathertop Alpine Lodge in the August 2015 peak season and the lodge was booked out. The lodge is located at the top of the village and over-snow transport is required to get the family and gear to the lodge at a cost of over $100 for the return trip. Keep in mind that when its busy it can take over an hour to park the car and transfer to the lodge via the over-snow system. The family room with 3 singles and a double bed cost $780 for 2 nights including breakfast. Compared to other Falls Creek Hotels the price is fair for this 3 star standard.The room was very compact and has not aged well, it was clean and tidy but the tired old hotel is probably overdue for a renovation. The bathroom was the smallest I have seen and there was hardly enough room to dry off and if you bumped the sliding door it would roll open causing all sorts of embarrassments.The lodge is very small with around 10-12 rooms and the amazing staff do everything. Your friendly, multi tasking receptionist (Erin I think) is your barmaid, waitress, room service and she did a great job of making us feel welcome. The chef was also very friendly and chatted with the guests. The dinner menu choices, presentation and flavours were exceptional and they even offered a special deal for 2 courses. The breakfast was a very basic cereal, toast, bacon and eggs, but really that’s all we need.Falls Creek sells the “Ski In – Ski Out” line, but its not that easy from some lodges. I had great difficulty finding an all down-hill return trail to the lodge that was suitable for our “intermediate” toddlers and the road down to the lift had poor coverage which is pretty normal even after fresh snow. If you were a beginner skier hoping to ski in and out you may have difficulty or an uphill climb.The lodge does not have a pool but there was an outdoor spa, unfortunately this was not working due to a broken pump. There is a ski locker and drying room which is awkwardly positioned down a steep slope between lodges. We would stay here again as the value for money and great staff out-way the small problems.

The hotel needs a bit of renovation with worn out carpet and an elevator that sounded like it was having a meltdown. I asked for a cheap basic room and I think I got the worst one in the hotel. There was noisy machinery in the wall that ran till late at night, that I think was part of a restaurant below. I opened the curtains and the view of the brick wall and dirty roof top was spoiled by the filthy dirty windows. The room and amenities were clean and fine for an overnight business trip and I would stay here again.
Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Hotel|Melbourne: Pan Pacific Melbourne|4| “Awesome City View”|review_288035633|On arrival at the Hilton the parking is quite a hassle for country folk, with nowhere to park at check in and I had to double park in front of the valet area until we worked out where to go. After being sent to a commercial car park across the road we then had to drag our bags quite a distance through the shopping center and out in the winter weather and across busy roads with toddlers. It may be worth paying the extra for valet parking next time.We had a 2 bedroom apartment on the top floor and purchased a family package through the website. It cost $549 for one night and included an “in room” roast dinner for four, breakfast, free in room movie, popcorn and a family ticket to the Polly Wood-side.It was a little disappointing and felt “cheap” to have to queue up in the barricades at check in, and I expected a better experience from such an expensive hotel. The check in staff were very pleasant and took their time explaining details and helping arrange the baby sitter. We attended a show at the convention centre next door and the hotel arranged a baby sitter that was very good but she did cost over a $100 for just over 3 hours making it a very expensive night.The TV remotes were faulty but the friendly service staff came and fixed them straight away. The apartment was excellent with a great spacious design and incredible full length panorama windows. The city and river view was the highlight of the stay for our country kids. I am no expert on beds and pillows but these were amazing and super comfy. We were on the top floor and there were plenty of fast elevators and no waiting but you have to remember to use your room card/key or you will end up on the wrong floor.The hotel location is fantastic for shopping, restaurants and bars but beware of the high speed, aggro cyclists on the shared walking path who nearly ran down one of my toddlers who had strayed over the white line.

Location...”|review_288022718|We picked the QT again for 2015 opening weekend because it has without question the best access to the limited skiing at the start and end of the ski season at Falls Creek. Outside of peak season it’s also reasonable value. This time we were lucky to have an apartment on the 2nd floor of the west wing which is at the same level as the ski run, so no stairs or elevator required and within a few steps from the lodge you are on the chairlift. Make sure you join the free loyalty program on the website or you will be paying more than you need to. We purchased a package through the loyalty website that saved a few dollars, but the delivery fell short of the promises. Extract from website: (When QT Insiders book accommodation for 3 or more nights between 31 May 2015 and 26 September, they will be treated to daily breakfast in our Bazaar Interactive Marketplace, complimentary WI-FI, late check-out of 12noon, Plus a $100 Food & Beverage Voucher to be used during the stay within any onsite outlet). The last time we stayed at QT the bazaar restaurant had a buffet “help yourself” breakfast which is ideal for kids, on this trip the Bazaar was not open and breakfasts were shifted to the Stingray bar. The Stingray has a very limited selection of “adult” choices but all the kids wanted was some basic toast, but this must have been too hard for the cook and we had an hour long wait and then finally a very poor presentation. The girls serving were trying hard and apologetic, but what is it with cooks and bad attitudes?I mentioned the poor breakfast experience at checkout, but the manager insisted that breakfast in the Bazaar (as per above extract) was not even included in our package.?? The sofa beds as mentioned in our last review are terrible, it was only just acceptable for our toddler but you couldn’t even sit on this saggy piece of rubbish without feeling the steel frame. QT need to throw these out and get decent sofa beds. Apart from the poor breakfast experience the rest of the long weekend was very good and we had great snow and weather. Don’t let these trivial problems stop you from staying at the QT as it’s a great experience but for the price you pay make sure you get decent service.
Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Hotel|Tullamarine: Holiday Inn Melbourne Airport|3| “Booking Service Terrible”|review_275667309|I needed a last minute, late night stay at Melbourne airport to catch an early flight and started the Holiday Inn booking online. The Holiday Inn booking system is terribly vague so I ended up calling the booking service to find out some information about parking and breakfast. The international call center was useless and eventually I was put in direct contact with the hotel. The hotel staff were excellent and provided all the information I needed and explained that the best option for me was a “park and stay” deal that included a week of car parking and a full cooked breakfast that started at 5.30am. This was perfect, so I reconfirmed the inclusions that seemed like an extra special deal and provided my credit card number and made the booking.I like to have everything confirmed in writing and asked Holiday inn to confirm via email. The email arrived quickly but did not include any details about the promised breakfast. I wasn’t willing to turn up and argue the details at reception so I called the booking service (call center) back and ended up stuck with “Pip” who was the most unhelpful booking agent I have ever had to deal with. I explained that I was offered the deal with parking and breakfast and Pip insisted that there was no such deal. I told him that I just made the booking so ask the sales agent I spoke to. Pip refused to put me through to the Hotel or contact the original sales person so I was now fed up and told him to give me a refund. Pip refused to refund my payment and then gave me the phone transfer / hold run around. Eventually I managed to get the hotel to call me back and I spoke to a very helpful Jasmine that confirmed all the promised inclusions even though they were not part of a standard package. So after wasting a huge amount of time and getting very frustrated I was finally able to start the 2 hour trip to the Hotel. On arrival the check in staff were friendly and efficient and reconfirmed the package. The room was very compact, clean and had everything needed for a business trip. The hotel is not new and the bathrooms are very dated with a shower over the bath and a shower curtain. There is a work desk and small kitchenette with a microwave oven. The best thing about the hotel is the location and it’s an easy walk to the terminals. You can stay 1 night but leave the car for several days in an unsecured area at a very reasonable rate. The car park is very tight and I was expecting to have some scratches or dents on return but luckily the car was fine.My low star rating for service only relates to the call center / booking service and not the actual hotel staff who were all fine. Unfortunately it only takes 1 bad experience to put you off a hotel and I doubt I would stay with any Holiday Inn again. I have stayed at all the Airport Hotels including the Mantra, Park-royal, Ibis / Formula 1 and Ciloms and my first choice for service, value, parking and convenience would be Ciloms Airport Lodge.

We really were not expecting to much as the apartments are very reasonably priced. I met Hazel at check in and what a wonderful greeting, I have never had such a genuine, helpful and friendly check in, including 5 star hotels. The hotel is in a great location with a small shopping mall across the road and many great Asian restaurants nearby. The apartments are only 3 levels and there is a lift. The car parking was included in the cost and was easy to access. There is a nice central courtyard garden. The rooms were basic but had everything we needed. The shower is over the bath but had plenty of hot water. We will stay here again as you can walk to the city and there are nice parks nearby for the kids.

Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Hotel|Moama: Moama on Murray Resort|4| “Excellent Family Getaway”|review_259018055|Moama on the Murray.What a surprise to find such a great resort so close to home. With a few small improvements the Moama on the Murray Resort would have the wow factor. We had a family get away weekend and booked 6 x 1 bedroom interconnecting “luxury villas”. Our inter-connecting unit cost $299 per night for 2 adults and 2 children.The resort has a fantastic setting with a central lake, huge grounds, surrounded by bush-land with lots of shady trees and attractive units that blend into the bush. We had tame kangaroos outside our unit each evening and it’s far enough out of town feel secluded yet still only a few minutes’ drive to the shops. The Lagoon Pool is well shaded with plenty of lounges and has a segregated safe drinking area, but the water is way too cold to enjoy with bathers only getting their feet wet.The splash park is great for toddlers with plenty of shade and tables and chairs for parents. Next to the splash park is a toddler’s bike track and jumping pillow. I failed to read the small print on the website before arrival and unfortunately most of the highlighted toddler activities including the unsupervised play house, water park, jumping pillow, peddle cars etc. all require an extra fee. These sort of activities are often included at other resorts or Big 4 parks. The response from reception is that the unsupervised toddlers play area is not owned by the resort, yet they take the entry fees and tell you when it’s time to leave. The daily charge to use the areas is not a big deal, but I felt the resorts marketing was misleading, and it appears many reviewers agree. The reception staff were excellent and very polite even when I expressed some disappointment, although I tried to call reception to inquire about missing items in the unit, but at 5 minutes past 5 pm there was no answer. The units are only provided with enough cutlery and crockery for 1 meal, requiring dish washing 3 times a day. The units are fitted with a (never used) front loading washing machine but no dishwasher. I cannot see the logic here when a dish washer could be used several times a day but a clothes washing machine may be used once a week. The bathroom was very nice and spacious with a huge bath and open high level “rain head” shower. I note some guests did not like the open shower as it did make a mess in the bathroom, but I thought it was great. The lounge and dining furniture was a bit cheap and nasty, uncomfortable and with wonky legs. There are shared undercover BBQs available for use free of charge.The Murray River downstream of the resort is restricted to 8 knots until way past Echuca and there are several boat ramps nearby. Unfortunately this means that most of the ski boat traffic and jet skis head upstream from this point to play “dodge the house boat” and the river congestion and lack of courtesy is horrendous and very dangerous. Don’t bother trying to water ski around Echuca or Moama on a long weekend.Overall we all had a great stay and were impressed with the resort design and I would highly recommend it for non-boating holidays.

It’s not cheap for a family of 4, but it was still good value and action packed. A mini bus takes you upstream 20 minutes from Sigatoka town to the new starting point to keep some of the local fisherman happy. The boats are in very good condition, and the safety equipment and briefing was good. The boat ride is fantastic and covered a lot more distance than I expected. Every Fijian we passed while zipping over the shallows waved happily and appeared to welcome the business. The highlight of the trip really is the village visit and our kids loved playing and dancing with the locals. The welcoming kava ceremony is followed by a feast and dancing. It’s a bit confusing but there is a protocol to follow when giving your gifts and you should avoid giving directly to the children. As part of the ceremony the gifts are gratefully accepted and distributed by the village chief. I think this is a good idea and should minimize any tendency for the kids to learn to beg for cash or gifts.The staff all the way from the check in desk, bus driver, safety briefing, boat drivers, and village guides were exceptionally friendly, professional and a lot of fun. You have not seen Fiji if you miss this trip.

The restaurant is nicely located on a raised open air terrace with views to the ocean. The staff were very friendly and helpful but unfortunately the power went out for almost an hour and the kitchen had to cook by candle light. In the end our meals were very late and quite ordinary. We did not have a chance to try the Bedarra again. Power outages were very common at the Outrigger as well but only for a few seconds, I think they may have had generator back up. We will try the Bedarra again on our next visit.

The road trip through the jungle is very easy on safe and well made 2 wheel drive tracks. You would have to do something stupid to hurt yourself. If you are after a high speed extreme adventure you will find this lame.Its a great scenic tour with a decent walk through the muddy jungle to get to a very nice waterfall and swimming hole. You spend a lot more time at the waterfall than driving the buggy's. Unfortunately the buggy's are very poorly maintained and ran very rough, stalling constantly. the buggy I had failed a dozen times and I had to get towed home in the end. The staff were very good and friendly and tried their best with the poor equipment.In the end we had fun but it was very expensive and I expected better maintained gear for the price.

Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Hotel|Sigatoka: Outrigger Fiji Beach Resort|4| “Excellent Beachside Family Resort”|review_252218191|The outrigger is a great family resort and we highly recommend a stay, but you do need at least a week to experience all it has to offer. No hotel or resort is perfect and although the Outrigger is amazing we have included a few flaws that we discovered.PoolThe outrigger has a great warm lagoon pool, with several shallow areas suitable for toddlers but with no shade over the water. A great range of poolside meals and drinks are available from your sun lounge. There are plenty of shady lounges around the pool, although it was pretty quiet during our stay and may become crowded if the hotel was busy. BeachBecause the beach is protected from the surf by the fringing reef there is safe supervised swimming and awesome snorkeling at high tide straight from the beach. There are glass bottom kayaks and snorkeling gear all available for coral viewing at no charge. When planning snorkeling remember that the high tide is 45 minutes later every day. RestaurantsWe visited all the Outrigger restaurants several times and found the food quality outstanding, the menus include equivalent Australian pricing and you would pay a lot more for the same standard in OZ, just don't expect Bali prices. The IVI restaurant was great with lots of surprises and little extras and the service from “Moses” was exceptional. There are also several restaurant options available along the beach and in nearby villages. I had a great meal in a local Sigatoka cafe for $6FJ and Koko,s bar on the sunset strip has a great ocean grill and cocktails.  GardensThe resort has fantastic shady tropical gardens with a huge variety of interesting plants and an artificial creek running through the resort all manicured to perfection. Much of the resort and restaurants are accessible under the cool cover of the thatched walkways.  SPAThe Bebe Spa has a Spectacular location on a hill top overlooking the resort with a 360 degree view of the ocean and the mountains. The Fijian bure style and finish of the buildings and gardens are beautiful. They offer a huge range of treatment's and products for sale. After a relaxing massage an amazing bar perched high above the spa offers fancy drinks and snacks with an amazing view. Room / BureOur stay was in a traditional “Plantation” Bure and this was our only disappointment and it did not meet the 5 star standard of other resorts we have stayed in. The Bure bedroom and bathroom were roomy and nicely decorated and included a basic TV. The stocked mini bar had all we needed but the selection was actually pretty limited. Bottled water was replaced each day but be careful to select the free water and not the chargeable. The butler and turn down service was a nice touch with drinks and snacks each evening. The shower over a very small bath with a shower curtain was quite a nasty surprise and we expected a lot better for a 5 star rating. The shower head was also mounted so low that you have to be a contortionist to wash your hair. We contacted the hotel twice about the air-conditioner that could not cool down the Bure enough for a comfortable night’s sleep. We had to leave the air-conditioner on all day on the coldest setting with the 2 fans running flat out. The filters were cleaned but this made no difference to the hot Bure, I noticed that our Bure in the full sun had a very thin layer of thatch compared to other Bures and perhaps this lack of insulating thatch was the problem. There are also many Bures located under shady trees and I would recommend that you ask for one of those. Activities The resort had a huge range of in house fun activities for when you wish to stay at the resort for the day and a large choice of tours and visits. The daily list includes around 17 different activities per day including sports, crafts and local experiences. Kids ClubThe Outrigger kids club sets the standard on how to run a kids club. It was difficult to get the kids to do anything else as they enjoyed it so much. The facilities, play equipment and activities are first class and all included in the price. The staff are awesome and you feel that the kids are being looked after by caring family. They have separate themed activities for the toddlers and the older kids and 3 sessions per day with meal options. This was the highlight of our trip for the kids and the adult free time. ShoppingThe resort has a supermarket, surf shop, souvenir shop, jewelers and local villagers selling their wares. The prices in the resort stores were very similar to in town and you could be confidant that you are not getting ripped off.  Wi-FiThe Outrigger Wi-Fi speed and availability is very good and is free for 30 minutes each day. If you need more data there are several purchasing options, I have always thought that Wi-Fi should be included in an expensive hotel but the Outrigger solution is a good compromise. I suggest you buy a local sim card for your mobile phone, I had one with 2GB of data and hardly used any despite using Google maps for navigation most days and looking up various attractions on the mobile web. In addition all local calls were free and short international calls were a ridiculous 20 cents FJ per call! BillingIt’s very common and disappointing that expensive hotels can’t get the bill right, we often find billing errors but never in my favor. Check your daily charges carefully, I checked several times during our stay at the Outrigger and continued to find charges to our account that were supposed to be inclusions. Reception quickly and politely corrected the errors but they would be easy to miss if you were in a hurry. Check your banking again a week or so after your stay for any extra unexplained charges.
Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Attractions|Mount Hotham: Mount Hotham Alpine Resort|3| “Spring Skiing”|review_231953236|We love spring skiing and Mount Hotham has some great terrain. I recommend Hotham for intermediate and advanced skiers but Falls Creek has much better beginner runs and children's facilities. Late September always provides great weather, plenty of snow and discounted prices but for some crazy reason the resorts are always deserted and many of the restaurants and lodges have already closed. Several times during this weeks holiday we were the only people on the ski run or chair lift. One of the good things at Hotham is the ease of getting around the village with the free snow bus, much better than the old “ZOO” cart. Over the years the staff attitude seems to be improving but you always get a few that forget who the customer is. Due to the mostly unplanned top of the mountain layout Mount Hotham actually has very few ski in – ski out lodges and at the end of the day most people require a bus or walk to get back to their lodge. In contrast at Falls Creek with plenty of snow on the village roads you can actually ski in and ski out of most of the lodges. Both Mount Hotham and neighbouring Falls Creek with only 100 road kms and 8kms actual distance between them are operated by the same lift company and a day, week or season lift ticket can be used at both resorts, but a combined resort entry and parking pass is valid only for Mount Hotham and Baw Baw with over 400 road kms between them, I would be very surprised if they sold many of those. A resort entry pass that included Mount Hotham and Falls Creek would make a lot more sense. The resort entry and parking is very expensive with a week on mountain costing over $300. There are limited places to eat in the main ski area at Hotham and it can be very difficult to get a table in peak season. the popular Swindlers bar and restaurant has a great location with an outdoor dining deck overlooking the ski runs but the place is dirty and smelly, the toilets are worse than an outback truck stop and its been like this for many years! One of the best places to eat is at the General store but its not in a very good location.

I was booked to stay at the Mantra by the company I was working for and received an email confirmation with a booking reference number.I had not stayed at this hotel before so whilst on route I called the number (hands free) on the booking confirmation to find the address which was not included in the booking details. Not off to a good start with a very long and frustrating wait on the phone. Finally I had the address and arrived at the hotel very late to find that I could not get in. I was at the front door that was locked and no-one would open the door, eventually a staff member smoking outside banged on the window and a waiting customer wandered over and pressed the open button. The hotel car parking is in an adjoining independently operated facility and it cost almost twice the price of the airport long term car park @ $61 for less than 3 days.I presented my email confirmation to reception but they could not find the booking despite the reference number provided. After many questions and fumbling through all their files they finally found the booking and a I was given a room key card. Of course the room key would not work, I thought its just me I’m tired and have probably put it in the wrong way or to fast or to slow. Ten minutes later a wandering staff member checked my key and said the door lock had a flat battery and I would need to change rooms. Around midnight I finally got into a room and thought OK I need to get a few hours sleep before that early flight. The saggy king size bed made up from 2 singles pushed together with a ridge in the middle did not provide a good nights sleep. The bathroom design is impractical with no room to stand or sit on the toilet unless you sit sideways or have very short legs. Check out everyone's photos. Its difficult to find something good about this hotel but I guess the regular shuttle to the airport is friendly and handy. A week later, I have not received and I am still chasing the return of my $100 CC deposit. This appears to be a common problem with Mantra! At $269 for 1 night in an average room with below average service and no breakfast I suggest you stay somewhere other than Mantra.

Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Hotel|Preston: Mantra Bell City|3| “Good Hotel, bad bathroom.”|review_219654786|Stayed at the Rydges Bell City for work. This is a very large hotel with several wings, on one of Melbourne's busiest motorways. The arrival is very difficult as there is nowhere to park your car during check in. The check in was friendly and helpful with an extra staff member allocated to chat to guests and promote the loyalty program whilst waiting in the queue. Once you have checked in and payed the extra parking fee, you get a pass to allow you into the multi level basement car park, which is almost impossible to manoeuvre into from the reception area. The room was freezing cold on arrival and I could not get the heater to work, I tried to call reception but was put on hold for a very long time. After 30 minutes the heater started to show signs of warming up. The room was compact and had a small work table and couch, but the bathroom was to small to be practical. If you are on the tall side you cannot even bend over without hitting your head on the wall and the horrible shower curtain draws in and gives you a cold shock. The shower mixer is very sensitive and the shower was either to cold or to hot, not at all enjoyable. The bathroom is a silly design because there is enough space in the bedroom to allow for a larger bathroom. The in-house “Chill” restaurant had friendly staff and very nice meals but the servings to small and expensive, a basic dinner for 1 was almost $70. The breakfast is also in the chill restaurant and had all the basics plus a small range of precooked items. Just a block away in High Street is a huge range of exotic restaurants and I had a great multi course meal and drink at the “Basil House” for just $17. As a member of the loyalty club you are supposed to get free WiFi and meal discounts, but the WiFi was unreliable and the discounts were not applied. I tried to get help with the WiFi but once again was put on hold forever and gave up in the end. The hotel has a small store in the lobby that sells all those last minute items and some groceries. At around $180 per night the hotel is OK but customer service could be better.
Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Hotel|Falls Creek: Falls Creek Hotel|4| “Great value and all inclusive.”|review_218332678|We chose the Falls Creek Hotel at the last minute after a change of plans. We first called the Falls Creek Reservations Center and were offered several unsuitable and very expensive hotels and apartments without any extras, after a Google search I found that the Falls Creek Hotel had vacancies so I called them directly. The telephone receptionist was very helpful and made sure we had the best deal for our family group. We liked the idea of the early kids meals and kids club so we booked the all inclusive meal package and were not expecting anything flash. The hotel is located at the top off the village and with a young family you need to use the over-snow (snowmobile) transfers which is very expensive at around $100 return for a 3 minute ride. On arrival the very friendly staff carried all our bags to our room. The kids had a ball and made friends at their early dinner sitting and kids club and we then had the luxury of a quiet no kids dinner. The included meals were amazing with choices of well presented and very tasty barramundi, duck, pork, prawns and great deserts. The dining room has a great traditional ski lodge atmosphere and a fantastic view of the slopes.All the staff were genuinely friendly and helpful and appear to enjoy their jobs. The room we had was recently renovated with a new bathroom and every thing was very clean, although a little cramped with 2 adults and 3 kids. The hot spa was great after skiing and the kids loved the pool. Our package included ski hire for everyone even though we did not need it and cost $670 per night. One of the best things about the Falls Creek Hotel is the location with ski lifts almost at the front door, this makes a huge difference with a 3 and 5 year old learning to ski. We highly recommend the Falls Creek Hotel for family holidays.
Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Hotel|Pantai Cenang: Meritus Pelangi Beach Resort & Spa, Langkawi|3| “Very large resort with great pools and average service.”|review_203294404|The arrival at the Meritus is spectacular with the beautiful open plan wooden reception area and great view through to the ocean, but waiting in the semi outdoor lounge to check in was very hot. Whilst waiting to check in, our group were offered cool drinks. Our group of seven for this trip required 2 suites and they were side by side on the ground floor but not adjoining. Unfortunately neither room was configured with the correct t bedding as requested and agreed via email well in advance. Both rooms had 2 single beds when we should have had 3 singles in 1 room and a king and single in the other which we payed extra for. I had to re-visit reception 4 times without success until late in the evening and way past our toddler’s bedtime. 4 times I was told that housekeeping would fix it straight away. In the end I had to demand that they show me where the roll-out beds were so I could fix the problem myself. We still ended up with a single bed doona on a king bed for 2 nights. There were other inclusions in our “package” that never arrived or had to be followed up.The rooms were large and impressive with all wooden chalet style construction and a very spacious bathroom. The balcony was huge but we did not use it much as it was always to hot outside. We were advised that they placed us next to the playground but this was just odd outdoor exercise equipment and unsuitable for toddlers. The WIFI worked well and the TV had all the basic channels and worked fine.We were picked up from the airport by the hotel and the next day we enquired through the hotel about hiring a car. We ended up catching a taxi back to the airport and getting a hire car for a third of the cost that the hotel quoted. There is about a dozen hire car companies all touting for your business at the airport. We had dinner twice at the resort restaurant buffet and the variety was good. The breakfast buffet had a good variety but was very busy and every day we had to ask for bowls, spoons and coffee cups. The self serve coffee machines could not keep up with the crowds. We had room service with the kids a few times and the food was good although the choices were limited and one night took 45 minutes to arrive.The kid’s club facilities appeared good, but with just a single male supervisor and a room full of young girls we felt a bit uncomfortable with this limited supervision. Our girls wanted to stay so we checked on them every hour and made sure we were there when they needed to go to the bathroom. The kids club was free but many of the activities were at an extra charge. The best part of the resort was definitely the beautifully landscaped pools with a great kid’s splash area, water slide, shallow area, spa and plenty of shaded areas and lounges. Unfortunately we could not see any pool supervision during our entire stay despite the obvious look-out chairs. The beach was very clean although the water was cloudy during our visit. Langkawi has stinging jelly fish so most people use the pools for swimming. There are plenty of activities on the beach, jet skis, parasailing, etc.The main street outside the resort has great shopping and restaurants and is very lively after sunset. The street food was great value and the variety of cuisines was amazing. We visited many of Langkawis attractions with the hire car and found that the price charged at the destination was always a fraction of the price quoted at the hotel. This huge resort has great potential but during our stay we were disappointed by the standard of service. It’s a 5 star resort with a 3 star service.

Peter B|87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4|Hotel|Batu Ferringhi: Hard Rock Hotel Penang|4| “Fantastic family resort”|review_202216963|Our group of seven for this trip required entertainment for toddlers, teens and adults. We chose this resort based on Trip Advisor reviews and a bit of Google research. We arrived at the Hard Rock Hotel in a hire car picked up from the airport and it took us about 45 minutes using Google maps on the smart phone. There is plenty of secure off street parking and we received a nice cool welcome drink on arrival. The room keys are swipe cards that you also need to use to access the elevator.The Little Rock Suite had a basic main bedroom room with an adjoining kid’s room. The kid’s room had a sliding door and a window in the dividing wall providing some noise separation. The kids had roll out trundle beds that allowed for more play area during the day. The kid’s room had its own TV with a large range of free in house movies, a play station and shelves full of books and toys. The resort has free high speed WIFI for guests. The only real disappointment was the very small bathroom with a trendy but impractical design. The bathroom had curious sliding walls that the kids could open. The shower tap was located in a silly position, so that you could not turn on the water without getting wet and possibly scalded. There were also no power outlets in the bathroom. On arrival the hot water did not work at all (no flow) but it was attended to quickly and did not let us down again. This suite did not have a balcony which was good with little kids. We had to get the IT and technical gurus to attend to our entertainment system as nothing was connected properly and the remote did not work. They came straight away and fixed all the issues with a smile.The Ocean View Suite for our teenagers had a balcony with an awesome view overlooking the pool and beach, but it still had the same silly design in the bathroom.We had dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe and the Pizzeria Restaurants. The service was good in both restaurants with mostly western dishes. The prices were OK similar to Australian restaurants. The breakfast buffet had a good variety and was available in two locations including the beach side cafe. We had room service with the kids one night and the food was great and arrived promptly.The kids club was excellent, with several friendly male and female staff members and a good sign in system where you could pre order lunch. The activities were all free and the kids loved it. The staff made us feel that the kids were safe and we had confidence in the level of supervision. The Hard Rock Hotel even had a teenagers club with computers, movies and games etc.The best part of the resort was definitely the Pools with a great kid’s splash area, water slides, shallow sand bottom area and plenty of shaded areas and lounges. There was also a hidden quiet adult’s pool. The pools were very well supervised with attentive life guards keeping the kids in order. You could borrow towels, rent float tubes or have a drink at the swim up bar.Penang has great shopping and street food and you do not need to travel far to the great night market, the Hard Rock Hotel provides a free and friendly shuttle bus every 30 minutes. The beach was reasonably clean although the water was cloudy during our visit. Penang has stinging jelly fish so most people use the pools for swimming. There are plenty of activities on the beach with friendly touts offering their services once you step outside of the hotel. We hired jet skis, but you could also go para-sailing, horse riding or island hopping. A nearby beach had plenty of monkeys.A short drive from the hotel will also take you to the nearby butterfly farm, spice gardens, “escape” adventure park, and the national park. The Hard Rock Hotel has young friendly and genuinely helpful staff and we highly recommend this Hotel for a holiday with kids of all ages.

During the Tet (Lunar New Year) festival that we went, it was very crowded and a popular place for everyone to walk across. However, in and of itself, it didn't seem to be an activity that would be worth traveling out of the way for (although as part of a day trip to the Hoi An Village and Ancient Town, it's worth seeing.

We still managed to have an enjoyable day for the most part, as Universal Studios did a pretty good job trying to keep rides running when possible during rain breaks or light rain. Also, many of the rides are also indoors (like Transformers and the Mummy) so you can still do things even in the rain. The one bonus of the rain was that some rides had shorter breaks than usual (especially after they would stop and re-start after rain storms). Although good weather would have made it more enjoyable, we were glad to still have a fun day even with all the rain.

From check in all the way through check out, we were amazed at the wonderful service and friendly attitudes from all of the staff from the reception, to all of the employees working in the restaurants, bellman, spa and travel desk. The attention to details (remembering our names, always asking if we need help, etc.) and consistency of service was almost unparalleled to any other hotel I have stayed at in the world (and I have been a multi-year platinum member in the Starwood and Marriott programs so have stayed at many great hotels and resorts).We booked a family suite which was great for our 2 kids and my wife and I. There were 2 bedrooms (1 King bed, 2 Twins) and a separate bathroom and shower area. Everything was clean and in good working order. They also offer free snacks and beverages at the mini bar which was a hit for the kids.We also ate at the restaurant Red Bean and used the spa during our stay, and both are also excellent.After our first night's stay, we were offered a free upgrade to a similar room with a big balcony. We took up the offer and we're pleased with the new room and again impressed that they would offer this for us. Another great example of their service was that they offered free laundry service for us which was helpful and they did it within the same day. Thanks also to Stefanie and Tiffany at the reception for the great service throughout the stay.We hope to visit Hanoi again for a longer stay in the future and we would definitely hope to stay at the La Siesta Hotel and Spa again!

What works well for this beach:- well maintained since it's inside Sentosa - both the sand area and the water. If you otherwise visit Pasir Ris or Changi, you run a risk of dirt on the beach, muddy waves and sometimes Stinging jelly fish - good shades to lie down and accessible and clean showers and bathrooms - ability to combine other fun elements with a beach side trip since it's inside SentosaSome negatives - accessibility - at least for Singaporeans - Take an MRT and then again a Monorail. For some it could be a good Long journey of 70-80 minutes - no barbecue pits :)

The experience completely lets you down. Here are the reasons: - The place is small and not maintained. You see dead butterflies, unclean pathways- No info or guide - you expect some signboards of types of butterflies. It's just a an enclosure with butterflies stored inside and you need to find out on your own. Even if you find one, you don't even know it's name and type- none to help or guide - all the staff just sit inside the comfort of AC and I couldn't find any out in the park to help - the place is quite old and looks like they haven't invested any money to upgrade with time. - Time we all boycott this place.

Some shows are worth to visit.- hidden gem is the Guinness record of maximum lights inside an enclosed space within the Hollywood area. Check the picture attached. - No food allowed inside. Don't carry any else you will have to unnecessarily rent a locker to store your stuff

Their main branch next to the temple of fine arts serves both lunch and dinnerWe went to this place today for an afternoon lunch. It's a decent spread as everyone else have already said. It's fresh it's hot. They make different breads on each day. On Saturday it's Chapati and my fav Appam. Don't waste the food here.While they say it's free food, they don't appreciate if you don't pay. The Lady runs towards the exit counter as soon as you finish your meal and I have heard that paying $10 per person is a norm which we did.

Positives:- It's bang Infront of the main ruins across the road. Advantageous location and come and take a quick break if you are tired- Helpful Hosts. They dropped us to a bus stop and also when I was almost sure that I have lost my wallet the lady offered me some cash to Ensure I do a trip to Bangkok. That was so touching.- The owner/manager is a certified massage therapist in fact a full time diploma. I couldn't get one fur to rushy trip- you can hire bikes or cyclesNegatives- Rooms have no windows- Rooms looks a bit dirty but let us give to them. It's a Budget hotel.

But the bus connectivity to the entrance is pathetic. The other side of coney that opens to Pasir Ris has no bus stops nearby and you need to walk atleast 1.5 Kim's from the gate. The island is still being developed and what it offers the best is for cyclists to have an off road experience and a good job in the midst of mild jungle and on the beach side. But as Simeone said get you ammunition of insect repellents.

The signboards are very discreet inside the shopping halls and you probably would get to know only if your friends or family have recommended.It's a large sized restaurant that can probably hold at least 60-70 tables at once. Over the weekends it's so crowded that the pure ambience of a rooftop could be destroyed by the sheer chitchat noise. But I will still give it to this place since they have been able to maintain a good taste. They are quite famous for their Mughlai dishes and Muttons which you don't often get here. I am a fan of their Dal Bukhara ( The slow cooked dal).The price points are pretty modest like any other Lil India eat out. You can expect 40$ for two.

It's a small food joint opposite Mustaffa gate 3 and only serves Vegetarian Gujarati and Rajasthani.The price points are very moderate and slightly lower than the regular hotels in Little India. But there has been no dishes which was below average. You can have an unlimited lunch Thali at 12$. Who can beat that! (Except Annalakshmi)My TOP picks: Hot Jalebi & Rabdi ( weekend menu), Chilli bajji, Pav Bhaji, Chats, Phulka, Kadi

There aren't many places that give you the authentic taste of BLR in Singapore. Everything is freshly prepared and served. My best picks are Set Dosa (You won't get anywhere in SG), Badam Halwa (too pricey but worth a lick), filter coffee and Ravi Idli..A sumptuous meal for two with a coffee should not cost more than 30$

You can get so many last minute deals at throw away prices on gumtree or carousell apps. Also many try to sell off excess inventory at Raffles or City Hall MRT- Every stand offers its own uniqueness. So chose the stand that's best for your needs speed vs turns vs grandstand etc - If you are not too keen to watch the after race concerts you can even sell off your tickets at carousell app and recover a part of your investment :)- If you are not that type to invest 100s of $ to buy a ticket then some places inside Marina Mall emergency exit stairs offer free views and they are quite good spots. Hunt around some places during the qualification days and geo mark them for the race day. - You can even book some restaurants on the 3nd or 3rd floor that offer the street view to the race. Nothing Beats a beer in hand inside ACed space ;)

Tips:- The ferry leaves from Changi Village jetty point. Please be aware that there are two jetties with the name Changi. Ask for the Changi Village one. - The bum boats strictly takes only 12 people. Shockingly they even charge for a 3 yr old kid. - Do expect Long queues while returning back from Ubin during evenings between 5-7pm. Atleast 30/45 mins wait- Wear Long sleeves and full pants.. Mosquitoes/Insects are aplenty- The hiring cycles are in rundown condition. So take small rides around to identify issues before you take it out!- Don't shop around for prices of cycles. It's all the same- There are only Two restaurants and get quite crowded during lunch times. Advised to pack your food!

Best is to hire a cycle and it would take around 20 mins. You also have mini cabs that also does a pickup and drop.You may check for free walking tours at the info counter. I don't think it happens Everyday. If possible time your visit to match with the Low tides (cycle repeats every 12 hours). That's when you can spot the best biodiversity. Take a lazy stroll on the walking bridges and view the flat guys taking off from Changi and escaping into the dark clouds :)also climb the watch tower which is around 6 storeys high.

The indoor seating is inside a glass dome which looks spectacular during day light. It's large sized and can accommodate at least 40 tables.Price point is average like most other restaurants and portion size is good enough. I would call this a meat lovers paradise and they good array of meat dishes. Same time a good spread of vegetarian options too.Expect an average of 25$ per person for a 3 course meal

Around 300m walking distance from Little India MRT, it's a South Indian joint. While the taste of the food is decent it's not heavenly that it deserves a 5 rating. The cleanliness of kitchen is questionable and I wouldn't give this a high rating for that surely. It's a like a old style chennai joint and for Singapore I would have expected a better cleanliness.

Morning 9 - Evening 11 I presume.- On Fridays it's only open from 7 PM to 12 AM but only wholesale. Only the main alleys would be open. So if you are a tourist avoid that.- Refer to the market map on Google so that you know what sections sells which items to navigate through easily.- You have a lot of good kiosks spread across the market and good street side things to munch. Try them! Shopping Tips:- Best part is over the years the extent of bargaining has reduced quite a bit and most sellers don't encourage it. Be assured of the listed prices. In some places you can still haggle by around 20-30% - Best is to buy multiple item in the same shop. Discounts can go up to 30-40%.- Don't bargain on promotional items. I haven't seen an instance where they reduce itClothing dominates everywhere and more for adults. You have kids wear but not much. For kids visit Platinum market.Also hunt for kitchen items, Accesories, Decorations etc

In my 32 years, I haven't seen a waterfall like this.. I was awe stuck when I got to this place. It's around 55 Km from the city and the roads are good enough. I did travel on a bike but it isn't that comfortable in the scorching sun. Take a car so that you reach faster and comfy. My handful of suggestions:- Don't wear footwear while climbing. Allow your feet to experience the surface. You just cannot fall down. I assure you. Even if you, you just cannot roll since the rocky surface isn't slippery and will hold you back- Don't fear that children can't climb. My 4 year old Son climbed all the way up the steep on his own with no support. - take all the 3 levels. It's different and you will love it.Including travel time the trip should take around 4-5 hours.

I just walked in on the way searching another restaurant. Since my Wife was too hungry, I just jumped in.I was very happy with the decision. The north Thailand red curry was so so flavourful.

Not that aromatic.I wouldn't say it's bad just that don't go here with TOI much hopes and get dejected.One idli + one vada + 2 coffees costed 10$.

I was standing peeping into menu in front of the hotel and every menu item said chicken, pork ribs, shark fins etc. I was in dual minds before stepping in and still made the courage to get in to figure it out. What I realised is they mimick those tastes through vegetarian items like soya, bean curds etc While it was worth the try for my Wife who is a pure vegetarian to realise how the chicken tastes and the taste profiles of a Chinese cuisine in its truest form, we didn't enjoy the taste to our best. The portions sizes are small. The service and ambience is just average too.

But after being here I can vouch and say you should plan one for a romantic sun setting dinner with a view of the paddy fields and a good Breeze. Use Google maps to locate the place and navigate else you will get lost in which by lane to go for. The service is very good and so is the taste. My pick of the lot would be the garlic breads.. So airy and crunchy..The pricing is like any average restaurant. Should be around 100 MYR for two.

That was surprising considering it was the highest rated Indian restaura in Langkawi. The ambience was very normal. But my 4 star is just for the amazing food that really tasted Indian. We had Paneer butter masala along with Naans. Both didn't disappoint. The prices were again moderate for any Cenang beach food junctions. A meal for Two should cost around 90 MYR

Hehe.But the restaurant is simple and on the beach side and is a good place for a sunset . It was raining when we went there and it was such a great atmosphere. I tried the pan seared salmon and it wasn't a tender soft salmon I expected but still not bad. My Wife tried a battered mushroom and she disliked it totally. Looks like they did not use the button mushrooms. The pricing is moderate. A meal for two would cost around 80 MYR.

But if you are in a relaxed holiday and is considering to visit one of the good beaches then this definitely can be one. Definitely not a very popular one and hence its secluded and adds to the fun. I wouldn't call this a must visit but if you are on a 4 night+ trip then you definitely can on your way to the Tanjung Rhu beach.

Don't forget to take a jump shot when you are up to express your joy!From the cable car you need to either walk for 230 Mts/10 mins by paying RM5 or pay RM15 and take the skylift that's always crowded and queued. When you have your kids to be carried or have elderly just go for the skylift blindfolded. Else feel the nature by takin a small hike to the sky bridge

It's Langkawi after all and hence its wildlife park should also be a scaled down model. It's a small zoo but one where you are fully engaged from entry to exit. What's lovely is you get to interact with every bird or animal and hence feel well connected. Don't think twice before buying the food packets for animal feeding. You won't regret if you buy 2! The zoo provides an enclosed pathway and hence despite weather you can plan it. They have umbrellas placed in all those vantage points so you will never get wet.There were so many new animals we got to see for the first time- the worlds smallest fox, Rangoon, hedgehogs very tiny deers.My 4 year old enjoyed all through as he got to touch them and feed them. The staff are very friendly and make it an hospitable sight. No complaints guys. Keep up the good facility.

While I was initially shocked to see that it was a very small dessert place the same time I was Glad that they are no. 1 ranked being a small but unique outlet. That's what make TA a genuinely traveller led portal.It's a street side place with around 4 tables and can fit in at best 20 people. Do try their crepes and of course waffles. Don't forget to try the waffle with their signature vanilla ice team. The creamy milky ice cream sways you away. Again moderately priced and a waffle costs around 16MYR and a drink around 10.

Like a 12" pizzas folded into a calzone. I feel the prices are moderate as well.The only cons are the restaurant don't use baby corns and jalapeños which personally is our preference but doesn't mean we should expect it everywhere. And yeah no desserts!

The paneer butter masala and the soft roti made my evening. Added to that is their signature spicy pumpkin soup.. I had never tasted one and it was a good try..A 3 course meal for two should cost around 1000 rs.

For the backpackers out there its a thing to ponder upon. - Peak Tram is the fastest way to get onto the top but the queues to get in are crazy. Read my reviews on the peak Tram in TA on Peak tram page for some tips and tricks. - You can plan Peak Tram, Madame Tassauds. Sky terrace and Victoria Peak together. Total trip time is around 4 hours. - Bets time to start your travel is early evenings and stay there till 8 PM when the HK skyline lits up for the laser show.

Grand old hotel. Good service as expected from a 5 star Hilton property. The hotel however needs a refurbishment as it is showing its age. When stepping out of the lift onto the floor we staid on, it felt very dated. The room are well appointed and the bed was amazingly comfortable. Good shower pressure (which I love). The location is good. On top of a tube station. Perfect. Lots of restaurants in the area. Easy walk the Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park and then over to Natural History Museum then down the Harrods, over to Buckingham Palace etc. If you like walking and exploring then you can’t go wrong. I would recommend and stay here again.

Enjoy!
thehopster|47FF90DDA4F7D3DD9C6FC9DBE3ACAB48|Hotel|Lisbon: Tivoli Avenida Liberdade Lisboa|4| “Nice Location & Friendly Service”|review_510334403|Wonderful location near the top of the Avenue da Liberdade. There is an underground train station basically opposite the hotel which is an easy way to get around. Personally, the walk from the hotel down the street is really charming and there are things to see along the way. This part of town is clearly expensive based on the retailers operating here. The hotel is warm and welcoming when you first arrive due to the large open lobby space and skylights. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The check-in was a little slow, but I think this had more to do with the hotel's processes and not staff related. Slightly annoying. The rooms are inviting and comfortable and feel like they have been renovated over the last few years. The bathroom is well appointed however my only issue is that there is there are no holders for shampoo’s or shower gels so you have to leave them on the floor in the shower which is really annoying as you are constantly bending over and going up and down to use them whilst showering. Seems quite stupid to be honest. I think the public areas on the floors however need to be upgraded. They felt old and outdated and do not reflect the room décor. Would I say here again? Yes. Overall I like the hotel.One gripe - As an Anantara Club owner, there seems to be no recognition. Little disappointing. As a Club member, I get better recognition at Hilton than at a hotel owned by Anantara!

We decided to start the day off with breakfast and we didn't miss a beat in choosing to go. I really like this part of Phuket. It has an international feel. The good is french inspired and is well presented, full of flavour and very tasty. Great coffee and fresh pressed juices. I cannot wait to go back again.
thehopster|47FF90DDA4F7D3DD9C6FC9DBE3ACAB48|Restaurant|Singapore: Garibaldi Italian Restaurant & Bar|5| “WOW - Dont miss the Sunday Brunch”|review_468670118|After 10+ years living in Singapore I have had my fair share of Sunday Brunches (mainly hotel brunches). I so wish I had discovered Garibaldi's earlier. The Sunday brunch is nothing like the hotel brunches as it relates to a smorgasbord of food, but rather a fantastic section across their menu. They bring out 6 entree sections (starters), 5 Mains and mini selection of desserts. We also went for the free flow option which includes Prosecco, red/white wine and beer. The quality of the food was devine, and I think considering the way it comes together, it is clearly focusing on quality (although the quantity was amazing too). I often leave brunches feeling like I missed out on something as there is normally so much food on offer you say to yourself "I really wish I had tried this or that". In this case I felt 100% content. Without a doubt my new and to be honest, favourite Sunday Brunch location in Singapore. Can't wait to return.

There is surprisingly a lot to do. At first glance you think it might be small, but it is quite large and the space is very well utilised. Lots of different themes and the kids will love it. There is also enough for the parents. Food was not the best (at least in the American diner we went to) and it is really overpriced. Suggest you head out of the park walk 2 mins into other parts of Resorts World to have a better dining experience. Make sure to get a stamp on the way out to save the grief re-entering the park. We found that come 5pm or so the park clears out and all of a sudden it takes all of 5 mins to get on a ride. I spent the next couple of hours taking advantage of checking out all the rides as many times as I could.Bottom line - Great day out and well worth the visit.

The Marriott on Orchard is a mainstay and perfectly located. The hotel has been through a renovation of the last couple of years and I was most impressed by the size the room and the overall quality of the finish. The pool area is amazing and surprising quiet considering it is located not far from one if Singapore’s busiest intersections. The pool itself is huge and there are little cabana's located on the far side. If you want to splurge there are also small villas (rooms) you can also stay in if you want a feeling of being in a resort. Breakfast is in the Cafe on the grounds floor and had every delight you can image. We stayed for 2 hours having coffee, enjoying the food and reading before heading back to the pool. I really couldn't fault the hotel.

It will basically take you anywhere you need to go and the integration with the buses means if you are basically transferring from the train to a bus then the fare is integrated so your bus ride might only cost you an additional 5 cents (yes 5 cents!). I suggest getting the Nestia App as it has a super easy public transport section and being Singapore all public transport is tracked so when they say the bus will be there in 2 mins, it will. happy exploring.

Hotel leaves a lot to be desired.”|review_421943245|Let me start by saying the location is really good (right in the heart of Trafalgar Square). Equally, the service staff where also great and I cannot complain about the breakfast which was also very good. What lets this hotel down is the rooms, or at least the one I was in. This hotel is also part of Hilton and I decided to use Hilton Points to stay there. Bad mistake. This means you get a room nearly the lift and the door entrance leading to the rooms. It seems all of the rooms in this position are teh same and all of them are disabled rooms. The bathrooms felt cheap, the decor was from the 1980's and to make matters worse there was some function on the roof and come 1am all i could hear was the clanging of bottles as the cleaners moved things outside my door. The hotel felt more like a backpackers than the 5 Star hotel they promote themselves as. I was also promised a partial refund of points, however this is yet to happen. I think the issue is that the normal rate does not justify what you are getting.

It is right on the waterfront in the very heart of where all the action takes place. Being a heritage building (basically a collection of old warehouses all joined together). The views are amazing and with everything right on your doorstep your ability to explore the city during the day and enjoy the restaurants and entertainment in and around the hotel makes for an amazing holiday. We had a great room on one side of the building overlooking the square and waterfront.The hotel also has a restaurant in which we had our breakfast and you can choose to sit inside or outside. The weather was amazing so we choose to sit outside and is was perfect. Can’t wait to return.

The IFE system was a little better, but certainly a long way off the offering and quality of SIA and QF. The headphone jack on my seat did not work which meant I had a 13 hour flight ahead of me staring into the abyss, they could not move me as it was a fully flight. Lucky for me, my wife wanted some sleep so we swapped seats a few hours into the flight after I had read most of the limited supply of magazines on-board (I never knew Hello Magazine could be so interesting!). The cabin staff mentioned they had issues with the headphones jacks all the time and they seemed very frustrated too as it was a brand new aircraft. NOW FOR THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE: What is with the armrests only going up about 75 of the way. As a family of three, we had three seats together, however the stupid armrest design made it really hard for our four year old to stretch out or for us to get comfortable. So annoying that I would not fly BA on long haul flights. It’s just plan uncomfortable. Food was ok.

thehopster|47FF90DDA4F7D3DD9C6FC9DBE3ACAB48|Restaurant|Singapore: Artichoke|5| “Hidden Gem”|review_348142317|Great little hidden gem in Singapore. When I say hidden, it sort of is. Located on the corner of middle road and waterloo street. Look for the little yellow church and its behind that. Food is middle eastern inspired and to die for. The venue itself is very laid back and almost bohemian. Well priced and well worth the visit.

It is clean and there are lots of dining options and of course shopping stalls everywhere. All small shops so lots of fun to explore. If you go with kids, head over to the big wheel area as there are other things to do there as well.As i said, worth the visit. BTW - Only open at night. Get the shuttle boat service from Thaksin BTS station.

Parts look good and other parts don't. For a city based resort, is location on the river makes for a different type of holiday. The hotel is set on expansive grounds. There is nothing to do in and around the hotel except for the night markets at Asiatique. This is accessed by a free shuttle boat and is well worth going for food and general market products. The shuttle boat also takes you to the BTS further down the river. The food in the main restaurant and by the pool was in my view below par. I know Minor Group owns the hotel and it felt like they handed it over to Sizzler to run (Minor operator Sizzler in Thailand). I was disappointed about this. The Wifi can be summed up in one word...CRAP. Slow, dropped out all the time and just plain terrible.

The hotel is feeling a little tired. Maybe a left over from moving over from being a Four Seasons to a Anantara. Rooms are a good size. Wifi is not good. The pool is a great size, but lacks a certain something!Would i stay there again...yes. Great service and very attentive. 10 out of 10 on this front.

Amazing views and so much better than the old Ku De Ta. As with most bars in Singapore, it is not cheap, that that goes with the turf. They have bar food on the roof, but i suggest booking into Stella on the floor below. Amazing food and top notch chef as well.

Very pretty with a good amount of small restaurants and coffee shops to relax and unwind in. The town feels very clean and welcoming. Very impressed.

Not the best location if you want to be in the old part of of Lisbon where you can explore and enjoy all the city has to offer. Rooms have been recently refurbished, which is good.Internet was a pain. Mobile and tablet connected but connecting with the laptop proved hard. Air-con in the room was noisy and kept starting and stopping. Very annoying.

In the heart of Sukhumvit. 30 sec walk to the Asok BTS skytrain. The rooms are large and of course the heavenly bed is fantastic. The rooms are starting to wear a little but nothing that would put you off. The F&B offering is very solid with a good amount of restaurants and their morning breakfast was extensive and clear they use fresh products. They have a good wellness approach the the food offering. Wifi was good, especially in the room. The staff are super friendly and very helpful. All in all very hard to fault this hotel and certainly one I would highly recommend.

It is also very easy to access the BTS if you walk via the main wing of the hotel to the adjoining wing. The rooms are a good size and i had a pleasant view over the river. The rooms are clean, comfortable and well appointed, however they are starting to get a little old. I feel an upgrade can't been that far off. There are a lot of great dining options. There are also some great little restaurants just outside of the hotel worth exploring.All in all a lovely property and well worth the stay.

We went on Sunday as a family for lunch as we had overseas guests with us and the staff did not miss a trick (service here is always very good). We had the lamb shoulder for 4 and it was to die for. Succulent and full of flavour. The best part is the fact the beers are brewed onsite and they really compliment the food.Once place worth visiting when in Singapore.

The bathtub is an elegant English style looking into the main bedroom with little touches which just work.Great rooftop bar and the breakfast was great with a few spins on it being able to make your own bloody marys and sparking wine (great way to start the day).

If you need to jump around BKK from a perfect location then you cannot go wrong. Also, if you just travel with carry on then the train from the airport is super easy and as it connect with the bts you can get to the hotel a lot faster than navigating your way through BKK traffic. The staff are great, friendly and you get the sense they will go the extra mile. The rooms are quite with great views over BKK and the bed is really comfortable. Bathrooms are well appointed as you would expect in a 5 Star hotel. Breakfast has all the choices you need as well as a few twists which make it that little different to the standard hotel breakfast. Well worth it. Buffet lunch is also a great spread. You must check out the roof top bar and restaurant (I didn't eat) but the bar layout makes the whole space feel warm. Drinks outside on the balcony are well worth it just for the fantastic views. Looking forward to my next stay.

It is close to the asoke bts station and the hotel has a tuk tuk which makes the walk from the hotel to the main road all that easier. Rooms feel modern and comfortable and are a good size. Wifi works well. The grounds are a little oasis in the middle of the city. Highly recommend having breakfast in the hotel as it overlooks the pool and makes for a great start to the day.

TV was small and an early flat screen from Samsung (i am mentioning this as it showed the age to me. Things were broken in the room, wallpaper was peeling, the bathroom had the shower head at the level of my chest (i am 6ft) and i had to bend down to have a shower. The cupboards where not aligned (showing age and constant use), i couldn't use the safety latch on the door as it would not work. The aircon in the room was also loud even when i had it on the slowest speed. Annoying. What worried me to most was the fact that a water bottle had the seal and the sticker the hotel puts on it broken to indicate is was used, but the bottle was fill of water. From were i do not know! I needed to point this out to the hotel as clearly housekeeping not doing their job and i am sure i would have been charged.Breakfast was ok, but the restaurant just felt a little "unclean". The location near the BTS was ideal for me. The saving grace.

There was a Krug champagne promotion happening at the same time so good company. The prices are what you expect for the location. Overall very happy Experiance.

It is the easiest, fastest and most efficient way to get around BKK. Equally, don't stuff around with taxi's at the airport. Get on the train and head downtown before switching to the BTS. Easy and very cost effective.

The rooms where very clean. The bathroom had everything you wanted and more (I love Japanese toilets).Breakfast has a large selection and all very fresh. Mind you the coffee could have been better. I do think they need better chairs in the room as it relates to working as the chairs are not the best for long term sitting down and working. I wish the pool was operational, but repairs have to happen.Getting from the airport on the train was super easy and faster than a taxi. You then transfer to the BTS and it is only about 5 stops. Terminal21 shopping mall is also perfectly located at the base of the hotel with direct hotel access and it is a great mall.I would certainly stay there again.

But in saying that and having spent 20 years doing business in HK, this is a good location in general. I love walking to work as the area has what i describe as that great HK feeling. The breakfast was good, but not great. Spend the extra and get a new Signature Room. Well worth it.

We ordered for meat and cheese platter perfectly complemented by prosecco to sip. Later, we ordered for sausages and lasagna. The taste was just perfect for the hot afternoon, not too spicy or hot. The staff was courteous and went out of the way to make our experience really good.Lastly ended up ordering Tiramisu to square it off with some sweetness and get a subtle savor of italian cuisine.

Location and connectivity is perfect, rooms are spacious with a swimming pool view. Wifi speeds were dismally slow which is now a necessity in almost every tourist destinantion. We found lots of flies around us and had to stay guarded against bites. Best part of the hotel is breakfast buffet options and front desk's attitude.

Easy way to access the trail is from alexandra road opp spjain bus stop and then take the bridge to the start of the trail. Its almost 2.5 kms uphill trail that will navigate through the bushes, greeneries, mildly dense forest finally passing through henderson waves ending in Mount faber cable car boarding point. It's mindblowing to see the connectivity and the view from hill top overlooking harbour. Since the trail is a strenuous activity, best suited to plan either early in the morning or during sunset so that humidity and heat is moderate and tolerable.

Set dosa, masala dosa and bisbillah bhath is a must try. It can certainly challenge any other south Indian restaurant in the town for its taste, service and value. Even the thali is good but i guess its too much for an individual to finish. At times it gets really crowded with waiting time almost over 30 mins.....I think it's time they should consider leasing out a bigger place, automate ordering system and make some arrangements for the folks waiting for their turn.

Must say, overall experience was rewarding and good. The staff is very friendly and ready to help anytime. We kept asking concierge for directions and local tips. They were more than willing to help and explain. Once they ran out of maps but then made effort to print it, draw directions and explain us in detail. Even the staff at the restaurant was pretty welcoming. We were travelling with kids and had special needs during the meals, staff was more than happy to accomodate our requests.

The rides are awesome and thrilling. Best rides are cylone, transformer, galactica and mummy. Usually the queue is long and might take time to take ride on any given weekend. But the trick is to keep thrilling rides until late afternoon when the crowd starts to thin down and disperse. Till then enjoy regular shows, madagascar, shrek, jurassic park.

I think they should realise that a genuine smile can bring cheers to the travellers. For instance, we showed the tickets to the staff on our mobile at the entrance, later we went to keep the mobile in locker located outside and then returned to the entrance.....to our surprise they again asked for the tickets. Despite us telling that we showed the tickets, they rudely pointing us away saying that tickets need to be shown again.....this was extremely frustrating and definitely dint leave a good impression on us.Overall the rides are good and well connected. The lazy river is a no miss as it will take you through different sections of adventure cove passing through aquarium and water showers. Even the body slides were a great fun to have. Best part of AC is snorkelling experience. Its definitely colorful,full of life, well designed and worth a waiting. Only thing, be careful of sharp rocks while getting in and out of water. Its slippery and can rough up your knees or elbow if not careful.Amongst the rides, we really liked Riptide rocket. It was thrilling, exciting and worthwhile. Recommend keep the best for the last. Overall its a very good place to spend time with family and friends and the experience will be even more joyful if staff is a bit more warm, friendly and smiling.

Prittravel1|109427F42560CEB23953AD7C465EAD4C|Attractions|Singapore: Wild Wild Wet|4| “Fun time with family and friends..!!”|review_455931908|We went to WWW on CNY weekend. Surprisingly it wasn't as crowded. Overall we spent good time with friends and family enjoying all the rides. There are lots of rides for kids and adults both. There is a good play area for the kids right at the entrance with lots of options ranging from body slides to fountains. Interestingly, WWW has lots of cabana's that can be booked(paid) either on the spot or in in advance on the same day depending on the availability. In addition to it, there are lots of free benches that can easily accomodate 4-6 people at a time.Then the next section is lazy river. It was an average experiece there. It requires upkeeping and upgradation for sure.Found the walls were chipped and it wasn't an adventurous experience afterall. After that we went to the main body slides and water park section. Body slides were really good and exciting. Best ride of WWW is Torpedo where you witness a free fall for few seconds. I think torpedo by far is the most exciting part of WWW. Overall, a good experience and can easily spend 4-5 hours depending on the queue and interest levels of the folks. There is another section still not open. It has lots of body slides and interesting water activities. We could only get a glimpse of it from the height but looked interesting and worth exploring once it opens.

Prompt service.They were making efforts to ensure that customers enjoy the meal. First inserted mobile in pouch to ensure that soup doesnt spill over it. Provided towels atleast 3-4 times.

Beautiful forest ride in open tram. Its informative and good experience overall. Either catch the tram at 10:45 AM or the next one at 2:00 PM. It will stop at the waterfall mid way for about 10 mins ....nice open area. Tram takes you into the forest crossing old wooden bridge over the water distributaries. Scenic drive.

Beer from the tap was just perfect and chilled. The queue to order food took forever.... I think considering that it will get busy during vacation time, they should have opened more options to take orders. Further, it took a Long time to get our order to table and entree's were served well after mains. I ordered the burger..... bread was bit stale, shredded into pieces even before could get a bite of it and meat was just not as expected. Other thing we ordered was fish and chips ..... it was just average and nothing great...... all in all it's much overhyped.
Prittravel1|109427F42560CEB23953AD7C465EAD4C|Attractions|Margaret River: Mammoth Cave|2| “Exit route not well connected”|review_449092255|The cave itself is really good and well connected. The steps that takes you to exit route ends up on a road. However there is no zebra crossing or speed breakers that will slow down the oncoming trafic. It looks like a safety hazard. Visitors have to cross the road to the other side of the cave in order to reach the parking. Crossing road with the kids is a daunting task..!!

It connects to hyderabad road on the other side of it and also to Kent ridge further down the jogging track. Surely a must visit

We went there thinking of getting a tour around the factory and having experiential learning around the chocolate manufacturing, esp wanted our kids to learn that but were a bit disappointed to see just a retail outlet with a small window displaying chocolate moulding process.

We got a good view overlooking the water pond and garden. BBQ area was well placed for us to enjoy our BBQ experience. Only flip side, it has no restaurant that can serve breakfast especially for the price it charges. Not much staff around to help you out. Its best suited for wedding or corporate events. Also, they charged whopping extra for the kids and dint had extra bedding for the kids....... Overall, luxurious cottage but not much value for money

Will require a moderate fitness level to attempt this climb.

Lamb burger was outstanding and the sausages are to die for. Looks like family owned cafe where everyone is trying best to serve the customers and ensure food standard is uncompromised. It can get busy at times with long queues and manual ordering process but then if you want to have the best, don't mind waiting for it.....thumbs up !!

We paid 100,000 rupiah between three of us to hire a tour guide and it was a great idea as they took us round quieter parts of the temple. There are carvings on each layer of the temple and the guide explained the stories behind them etc, without him we would not have known what they depicted. However, if you are not Asian you will repeatedly be asked for selfies by adults and children alike. They seem more interested to get a selfie with you than of the temple itself. The tour guide was good at deterring some people from asking or would step in to help us out if we got stuck with a group. We let some people have group selfies with us but then they would also want individual photos with you, just put your foot down that your having a tour and need to go.

The views are amazing though. I went in the middle of the day and it was very hot and hardly any shade so I would suggest missing the parts of the day when the sun is strongest. Also everything on top is very pricey, they take a photo of you and superimpose the building into the background then want 70 dollars for it

They pick you up at 8:30am when the park doesn't open till 10am as they stop lots to pick people up and just sit for a while in a car park. Better to get a bit longer sleep and just go there directly. Some of the movies/themes are a bit outdated now like battlestar galactica and waterworld.

The staff were really helpful, pointing out to me that it was only an extra 5 dollars, when paying for the zip line, to do the jump. Sham drove us up to the zip line point and was such a lovely member of staff singing and making everyone laugh. There was quite a long wait for the zipline when we got to the top so by the time we did the zip, the sun was setting but that was really nice!

Very very courteous, helpful, accommodative and humble. Loved and lived every bit of my stay here.Luckily, we were the first customers of the rebranded resort (Evolve back).Ambience of the resort is simply breathtaking. Had visited for anniversary and the staff went out of the way to honour our every single request Although the dinner cruise was out of service for some reasons (had requested one), but the hospitality wins over all of it. If there were more than 5 stars, would have given back. The restaurant, pool area, private jacuzzi, reading lounge are all worth mentioning. Special mention to our hut executive Ms. Aarushi and the yoga instructor Mr. Aakash for making our stay comfortable and serene.Thank you orange county aka evolve back.

Pathetic hospitality. Uncooperative management and staff. Cannot accomodate small requests despite easyily doable. Differentiation between customers who book online (esp. goibibo) and direct customers. Level of service differs for both. Far from key locations and entire resort was almost empty when i visited. Not more than 5 rooms booked. You would hardly see anyone except staff inside the hotel. Gets scary at night. A new resort yet inhospitable staff and management. Will never recommend anyone to visit this resort ever. Try amanvana next door or best is club mahindra madikeri, when in coorg.

Each dish is quite big, and includes a drink, a main course and a serving of rice, noodles or fries. Long lines are rare, but on weekends wait can be up to 30 mins. I recommend against booking on the telephone as it is rarely honoured. Steak and pork chops are good choices when paired with spagetti, while burgers might be better suited for those with a small appetite.

Even so, I found the staff efficient and capable. The chicken is pre-prepared but still tastes fresh and crispy. The Cajun wings are too artificial in my perspective, however the normal chicken strips and thighs taste great.

This was my second trip here, my first being much more uneventful. I would recommend not coming here because of such terrible service. No further comment.

There were no entertainment systems but a clean environment was maintained. The seats were also decently large with acceptable legroom. Disappointed that when I ordered Cathay they gave me dragonair, but what can you do...

The egg with the rice also makes the dish that much more enjoyable. However, the staff really downplayed the experience, with attitude being poor, to say the least. Being one of six tables, I was suprised to see the waiters just sitting by the kitchen door while I tried to hail them over. In the end I had to walk over and tap them on the shoulder, which set a grim mood for the rest of the meal. I would also avoid getting the lava cake. The chef seemed inexperienced at creating the dish, and it took two tries for him to get any sort of melted chocolate in the center, at which point I gave in. The menu is quite diverse, with seafood, the 3 main types of meat (chicken, pork, beef, no mutton though) and the prices are agreeable.
Solomon L|747FDFB38BCB65355B6301B04E7CF329|Attractions|Hong Kong: Stanley Market|3| “Lots of interesting things...”|review_510810003|But lots of scams too. The warm feeling of walking through family owned stores is a special one in the retail oriented streets of Hong Kong. There are various stores offering cheap electronics such as drones, charging wires and cameras, artwork of Hong Kong (which I recommend picking up if you can carry it (most about 2m by 1m) because they are so beautiful at around 200Hkd a piece), clothing, as well as other obscure things. They offer overhead shades which are great for blocking out the sunlight on a hot day too. However I recommend some Cantonese ability, as I was able to negotiate a better price than my English speaking friend.

The exhibits were also very interesting in detailing the history of Hong Kong's currency. Our tour guide was very fluent in English, and enthusiastic about the topic. The long timeline, wall of banknotes overtime and the counterfeit note identification exhibits were my personal favourites. Booking can be troublesome, and valid id is needed, but otherwise a friendly and fun trip.

I was lucky enough to sample the piedmontese ribeye steak and the kurobuta pork fillet. The ribeye was perfectly grilled, with a distinct black checker sear on the outside and a nice pink in the center. The pork had a perfect consistency throughout, being soft to the bite and rich in flavour. They also offer a variety of salads, my favourite of which is the potato. Though this is one of the more pricey steakhouses, I could personally recommend this to those willing to make the trip. The pork was 160 dollars (hk) and the ribeye was 210.

The staff were extremely helpful and polite, as well as speaking fluent English. Their complementary breakfast is superb, with my personal favourite being their braised beef, which tastes fantastic with rice. They also offer international choices such as omlettes, cereal, bread etc. The selection of fresh and flagrant fruit was also much appreciated. Their famous duck in the upper level restaurant is a must try. It is a fair distance from the city center, but if you ever need a taxi the staff will eagerly help you. They also have a well equipped business center I got to explore. WiFi connection is complimentary but slow.

The breakfast provided was a well balanced blend of continental and Taiwanese. The meal benefited from local specialities such as pork floss, noodles and seafood, as well as the classic omelette no hotel ever messes up. I wish the rooms were more luxurious given the high price, but you can't have everything I guess.

Though they are on the pricey side, it's a purchase you can rest comfortably with, kniowing the staff will take care of your needs. Their food is also great, I like their omlette, much better than their competitors, but what truly stood out was a piece of steak. (Bear with me I'm combining both to and return trips) For economy class, a piece of meat is quite generous, but a full poece of steak cannot be glossed over. This, when combined with their great offers for attractions in Singapore and discounts, makes for a great trip.

This KFC has never mishandled my order, while I have to argue with the chef in the chinese restaurant facing KFC for 5 mins before they realise they gave me someone else's order. The KFC here serves great and fresh chicken, and I love the chicken rice. The new year promotion of Buttermilk chicken was fabulous, and I wish it was a permenant product. Lately, their beef rice is decent, but Yoshida offers better ones. (I swear they did this because Yoshida launched fried chicken in their branches). Wish that the mobile app was better, but this is no fault of this branch. 5 stars!

My order was processed without delay, and I love the cheesy bites with it's soft cheese stretching just like in the advertisment, and the mix of cheddar and mozarella surely can't be passed. The pizza hut app with a gold membership also helps. The only thing I wish is that they brought back poutine, but it's ok. That's why we have Triple O's.

Relatively secluded when compared to New Town Plaza, there's a plethora of food choices. A McDonalds, Chubby's Chicken, Pie and Tart, a ramem shop, Genki sushi, a chinese dim sun restaurant (洒樓) and much much more. I typically like to get Genki Sushi for tea as they have great offers (get the app, it's called Genki sushi), and the ramen shop. Chubby's has great chicken last I ate there, but if you want pizza, go to pie and tart. The Jusco is also decently large, and getting enough money to redeem free parking on the first floor counter is not a problem.

I saw the menu was quite pricey, but still went in. I was shocked at how slouchy the staff were at serving up food. The french toast was decent at best, but at this price point, truly no worth it.

Because of a patch, many pokestops have been removed, and so the rewards gained are no longer worth it. During day time it can get a bit to sunny, and sometimes there are mosquitoes, but during the night, it's usually a quiet walk with a nice breeze, looking across the water at the science park and the Tai Po highway. There are paths for walking, jogging and bicycles, so it's certainly worth coming.

At the night ceremony, the staff presented a wide selection of cakes and pastries accompanied with an assortment of drinks. However what truly impressed me was the kindness in the staff. My roomate decided that he would lock us out by leaving our cards next to the coffee. Luckily for us the hotel staff were friendly and let us in. The environment is also nice.

The staff here are always efficient and polite, even through the more stressful new year. I was dissapointed their buttercorn chicken didn't last longer, as the Mc Donald counterpart Jiang Zhun burger is still available, though this is no fault of this branch of KFC. Even though I usually get takeout, I can still see the tables are clean, much to other customers' delight.

Everytime I go to Singapore I drag my less enthusiastic parents to the nearest joint at least thrice. The joints in Tai Wan were also superb, building up this image of decent price for excellent dumplings, wo tie and noodles. Then, I went to this branch, and it felt so empty, like something was missing. The food was decent, but not fabulous like the Singaporean and Taiwanese joints. The staff were also slacking, and I had to go up to them to make an order. As a furthur insult they got it wrong, during low hour when there were five tables in total and 12 waiter and waitresses. Dissapointed, but still worth going for people who can't go to Singapore or Tai Wan joints.

My favourite dish was of course the dumplings, with their soft skin encasing a warm and rich pork soup, and a piece of meat and vegetable soft enough to satisfyingly bite into, while hard enough to stick together. The idea of an visible kitchen is great, as the staff are pressured to do it right, and I wish more restaurants followed suit. The chefs were also chill, posing for a photo before continuing making dumplings. Normally I would credit several members, but I feel their success is from a great team, so great job!

Unlike other buffets, this place gives you great value. The staff are efficient and polite. On this particular visit the staff seemed a bit demorolized, but they were really open, and I hope I cheered some of them up. I certainly can't blame them for this, as the stakes and pressure is high from a quieter than usual new year. The food was great as usual, and I implore you to try their Cha Siew. The fat and meat balance is great, and from the rich taste you can tell it is of the finest quality. Their grill section was also fantastic, quickly serving out pizzas with thin and crispy crusts, just the way I like it. Their numberger sausage and ribs are also very well grilled on the spot, if only the pasta was made to order too. Of course I can't miss out on the generous selection of desserts, the variety of which amazes me to this day. From their acclaimed egg tarts and apple pies (both must tries!), to simple ice cream, fruit and candy, they seem to have everything. I have to include that the staff cleverly offer you ice cream on their crepes and pancakes, a great dash of creativity on their part. Though slightly pricey, it is certainly worth it, I promise you that.

Unfortunately they seem to frequently run out of stock, always not having my favourite braised beef noodle. The queue, especially at night does get ridiculously long, but welcome to the city life I guess...

They have the new self ordering system outside with octopus, which is extremely convenient. I ate the new Jiang Zhun burger (available at all hk joints for new year, nothing special there) which tastes good. Generally a 3 min wait time but can get crowded during lunch hours.

They believe that the higher the branch the joss paper ball lands on and stays (pray there's no wind), the more likely their wish will come true. This is especially popular with new couples (newly weds) and during the new year, during which you should avoid at all costs! During the new year the main road is closed, leaving everyone waiting (including the poor local residents) at the highway exit. Any other time of the year should make for an easier trip. However, to protect the trees, they decided to switch them to plastic trees, which I'm pretty removes the wish granting effect. Still, I do think it was the right thing to do. Worth visiting apart from during the new year, food, drink, sunscreen and mosquito repellent is advised.

This makes for a good deal, especially due to its decent food, however, it is quite lacking when put against its nearby competition such as Hyatt (with a superb chinese food section, including their world acclaimed cha siew) and 2+2, with their good price on seafood, Momo seems to lack anything special. There is generally less people though.
Solomon L|747FDFB38BCB65355B6301B04E7CF329|Restaurant|Hong Kong: City Art Restaurant|3| “Disappointing changes”|review_459833771|The restaurant changed its menu to (supposingly) lower costs, but this resulted in a dissapointing meal in comparison to before. Before there were excellent dishes such as a rib eye steak, or a mushroom risotto, and others which you could order any amount of in the given time. Now they downgraded their service like so many other buffets, with only one main course available per meal. I cannot express furthur disappointment in this, as the price has remained the same. I doubt I will return, especially when others such as Hyatt in Sha Tin are putting up stronger performances for a similar price.

I will admit it does get crowdy, so trying to get a long shot of you and the Sydney Opera House can be problematic. This might actually be a good place to go in a rainy night, as the light from the Opera House makes for a cool shot. A variety of boat tours are available here, and there's a mall on the left (facing the sea) with a Kfc, some chinese food and other things to eat. I was impressed at the availability of an Imax cinema, but did not have time to look inside.

Blue mountain had excellent views, and a thrilling ride down and up the hill, where I loved to turn a seat to the most vertical position possible (around 70 degrees I think), zooming down as I looked at the scenery. I took it several times before the lines started to get longer, as the trip arrived early in the morning. Do note in the morning it gets cold. I do mean cold like just above snowing. The breeze is refreshing for me, but many people dislike it. I loved the Featherdale wildlife park too. It brought back memories for over ten years ago when I first went. It's always been my dream to hug a koala again ever since the first time, but due to new laws I wasn't allowed to. Surprisingly, the koala decided it liked me, and clawed me with its hand and hugged me. If only I got a photo, but dream come true! The kangaroos were also friendly, and hopped around like normal. I also managed to see a tasmanian devil, which admittedly is very different from what I expected. I will note that I miss the crocodile mascot, but the park was still a great place for me to fufill my dreams. Now all I need is to meet penguins...

The toilets were usable with a complimentary drink being welcomed. They have lots of domestic flights throughout Australia, and their variety of planes is amusing to me. From the largest A380s to propeller driven twenty seaters all in the same terminal, it is a sight to behold. The transfer service provided by Qantas Transfers was also good, with ports for charging and sofas for sitting. The bus ride was quick and undisturbed. A strong performance indeed.

We were very annoyed by this, and were only able to do so because the other tour company was very nice, and swapped for us in such a short notice. Then on the day we asked them again, and only then (10 mins before) did they act confused, and deny the existence of any tour. This caused us to face a choice: waste the day, or try to catch the previous tour. We did the latter, and rushed to the harbour, making it in just the nick of time, and I can't thank Pennicott tours and the best western hotel staff (who helped us make the phone calls) enough for that. I find this extremely disappointing, as this ruined my perception of Gray Line, for which I loved their tour in Uluru, along with a general increase in customer ratings for their company. I sincerely hope they follow their claims for ensuring that such things never happen again, because this caused us to lose a full day of the vacation, and such events can ruin a tourist's trip. Gray Line should rethink their customer service and management, because as of now, Gray Line ruins trips.

That's no small feat, and that certainly is reflected in Sentosa. The staff were very friendly, the park was extremely clean, and the rides were as usual brilliant.

When I joined the guided tour, the man literally talked and talked and talked, in which the details were good as my first language is English, but my family were extremely confused, along with a majority of the tourists, and we left quickly. The scenery is nice, and there are good explanations on signs, though it may not be a good means of interaction for less enthusiastic readers. A key show point was the boat, which took 10 mins (plus ten mins wait), which had ac, a welcome change to the hot weather. Worth coming if you have an interest in convict life, as that is delivered with life stories.

Solomon L|747FDFB38BCB65355B6301B04E7CF329|Hotel|Hobart: Best Western Hobart|4| “Gets the job done”|review_456850673|A simple modern hotel with basic facilities. Bathroom is decently sized though the shower is a bit short for my liking. Event rooms are nice and large (50 people), and the restaurant does have food (not good, more on that later). The reception were helpful, which earned them the 4 star rating for me, but honestly nothing special to earn it a 5 star.

Solomon L|747FDFB38BCB65355B6301B04E7CF329|Attractions|Hong Kong: Bank of China Tower|5| “Beautiful Triangular construct by I M Pei”|review_456834844|The beautiful beams of light I saw during the night view was spectacular. I already did a review of looking at this iconic piece from a distance in my Hong Kong Skyline review, so this mainly focuses on getting up close. At night, the lights from the passing cars, the street lights and displays from other buildings all reflect on the Bank of China's glass pannel exterior, making it a beautiful spectacle. The white light beams also serve as the border for the building, an interesting choice I have come appreciate. Finally, its near the peak tram, so if you're in the area, just go on some footpaths and explore around, its worth it.
Solomon L|747FDFB38BCB65355B6301B04E7CF329|Attractions|Hobart: Bruny Island Safaris|5| “Excellent guide Michael!”|review_456833640|The tour was excellent already, with great views, interesting context, and most importantly a hotel pickup, but the thing (in this case person I guess) that stood out to me most was our guide Michael. He has extremely good context, being able to identify many different plants, passionate commentary about his inspiring and touching life story, one standing out being him jumping into shark infested waters to get scallops for his child, as well as his patience and driving skills, helping us capture some great photos. I would honestly reccomend you join this tour just to meet Michael, but the tour is also fenominal, well worth the time and fee.
Solomon L|747FDFB38BCB65355B6301B04E7CF329|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|5| “The better Disneyland!”|review_456779765|Filled with roller coasters, shows, shops and more, I absolutely love Universal Studios. My personal favourites from my last visit includes Spielberg's Lights Camera Action, the Guinness World Record Lights display, and the Transformers Ride (name). Starting with Spielberg's Lights Camera Action show, I love the way they compress the complex process of movie special effects into ten minutes. From the small details such as the sound of rain tapping at the side, to the large fiery explosion engulfing the set, the ten minute spectacle is certainly worth watching for anyone who has watched a movie, just for an idea of how it's done. Then the lights display.
Solomon L|747FDFB38BCB65355B6301B04E7CF329|Attractions|Hobart: Pennicott Wilderness Journeys - Tasmanian Seafood Seduction|5| “I have been seduced!”|review_456778978|It's strange that a person allergic to a majority of seafood would reccomend a seafood tour, yet here I find myself doing exactly that. It's worth it! The price tag turns away many people, but with a bucket load of knowledge on seafood prices and quality from Hong Kong, I assure you this trip is worth every dollar. The guides Dave and his partner Jerry delighted us with fice amazingly presented courses (see photos below for Abalone and Fruit), which were prepared and presented at the highest of standards. The salmon (sashimi) was also well plated, but we couldn't resist and ate it all before we took a photo (sorry). Although I wasn't able to taste the sea urchin, the oyster or the lobster, I can assure you the taste is superb, as judged from the look, aroma and comments from others. Our guides also enriched our experience with an enthusiastic and passionate attitude, excellent knowledge of the nature we explored, and good navigational skills, which helped us get close to a group of penguins, as well as several dolphins, salmon, an eagle, and seals, leaving the group with some memorable photos. If that weren't enough, our guide Dave was kind enough to pick up some cherries from a farm on the way, delicacies we all enjoyed, as well as some sweet chocolate coated strawberries as dessert, for which I can't thank him enough. There is no need to worry about drinks, as an excess of wines, beers, juices and bottled water is provided, however do take note that although going to the front of the boat and feeling the wind is comfortable, you do need sunscreen. Other than that, bring an empty stomach, and enjoy your trip!
Solomon L|747FDFB38BCB65355B6301B04E7CF329|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Sentosa Merlion|4| “Iconic”|review_456641231|The Merlion for Singapore is similar to the statue of liberty for New York, an iconic piece that brings pride to its citizens. I like the look of it, which is why I went, but if you aren't that type of person, just don't go.
Solomon L|747FDFB38BCB65355B6301B04E7CF329|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Skyline Luge Sentosa|5| “The safe version of go carting”|review_455749112|The thrill of riding the luge is huge, from the starting moments of the luge accelerating, to the finish with the bending tracks, I absolutelty love the luge. This time around was even better for me, there were abandoned luges everywhere. However, this may be problematic for those with less experience. Being my 30th time (yay), I easily dodged the new obstacles, but others may have trouble doing so. Still fun for everyone though. The skyline is average, but its better than walking.
Solomon L|747FDFB38BCB65355B6301B04E7CF329|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Adventure Cove Waterpark|5| “A surprising experience.”|review_455743913|The amount of rides here is simply breathtaking, from high thrill rides such as duelling racer, pipeline plunge, and spiral washout, to more animal based ray bay and rainbow reef, even a long and relaxing lazy river for those who want to chill. And I can bet all the water there that the staff are here to help you enjoy that experience. Just months ago, we just got in the park, when it began to rain, immediately shutting down every ride. Thankfully, the staff were able to help usbget a full refund, as the only water we touched in the park was the rain. This time around, the weather was perfect, and my family and I were able to enjoy the fantastic rudes that keep us coming every year to the fullest extent. Yet my favourite attraction may not be an eye catching one: the wave generator at Bluwater Bay. I found the attraction so unique compared to water slides, which are superb in their own right, as I only found the use of wave generators in the Navy's testing facility prior. I love bouncing up the waves like I would on a rollercoaster, as I slowly push forward against the current to the front. The trill is just amazing. (just note if not proficient at swimming goggles are recommended) Another ride I love is of course the lazy river. Juat floating along the current, watching the sky and all of the surrounding objects. The only downside for me was being shoved vy a rude Pakistani family at the glass section of the circuit (where I enjoyed looking at the stingrays), but this was in no way the fault of overcrowding, just an inconsiderate family. Some tips to finish this off: -Bring sunscreen, the sun reflects off the water so be careful, especially of the regions on your face and neck-Bring mosquito repellent, two years ago my experience was ruined when I received two bites and had to leave early-Don't get lockers outside, there are lockers inside, and there's at least one free 98% of times. You shouldn't even need a locker just grab a beach bench or a table on the sideThat's all, hope you have a splash!
Solomon L|747FDFB38BCB65355B6301B04E7CF329|Restaurant|Hobart: Embers Bar Pizza Grill|2| “Nothing Special”|review_455555347|I had my first breakfast in Tasmania here, and it was honestly quite lacking. Similar to my comment on the Berlin Meinenger hotel, they need to stop serving chinese food (someone tell me why they do this). They should serve up local foods, which is interesting for tourists, easy to find ingredients for, which makes it cheaper and fresher, making it taste better, and also helps it stand out. Even better, it should be easy to prepare as the staff should know how to do so (locals). There's not much else I can say. Just go to the bar down the street, they have steaks for anywhere from 10 to 25 Aud, a better deal than this Embers Place.
Solomon L|747FDFB38BCB65355B6301B04E7CF329|Attractions|Hong Kong: Hong Kong Skyline|5| “Truly beautiful”|review_455134254|Hong Kong is famous for its night view, and for Hong Kong Skyline this is no exception. Beautiful lights from the various buildings dot the top of the surface of the victoria harbour's surface. Notable buildings include IM Pei's Bank of China, with beams of light alternating between red and white as they transverse the edges of the glass triangles, to Norman Foster's HSBC Main building, with a beautiful red illuminating the two stairways at either side. The most impressive however, must be the ICC, the cousin of the famed IFC and its crown. It is the ninth tallest in the world (at the time of this post) and the tallest in Hong Kong, and the view of it is equal to the beauty from within it. The Skyline's beautiful view can be matched only by the peak's panaramic view of Hong Kong, but its free and there are generally less people, when compared to the hundreds of people lining up from 4 at the peak.
Solomon L|747FDFB38BCB65355B6301B04E7CF329|Attractions|Cathay Pacific|2| “The worst of the best”|review_455129984|At this price point, their service is extremely lacking. I was a frequent flyer with Cathay, so I have seen first hand how it had slowly downgraded itself. Trust me, just fly Singapore Airlines for Asia, the US and Australia, Lufthansa for Europe. (Singapore for Europe is fine, but they have less flights there so may be less convenient) My first negative experience with Cathay was 6 months ago, when they gave me a burnt meal with a fly crawling out. I don't know how it happened, and I don't care. All I know is a fly (or any insect) should not be alive inside a cooked meal. I mean you'd expect the fly to land on it right? When I told the attendant about this, he kept on denying it, even as the fly flew past us. I then just asked him for a cup noodles, and then he told me "why the hell do you want a cup noodle, you have a meal in front of you." At this point I just gave up, and left the burnt insect housing meal in front of me and slept. Another experience two months ago was also dreadful, when a crew member told me to shut up after I told him the seat was broken, and the control had gum on it. (pro tip bring wet wipes, and wipe everything, the screen, the arm rests, the controller, the table etc. The cleaner's only job is to make it look clean.) When I took Lufthansa, the flight attendant called the manager, and the two of them repeatedly appologized after I reported the seat pocket broken. Just the seat pocket! When Cathay blamed me for reporting a moderate problem they failed to notice! But the reason I'm writing this is based on this trip I went on today. First, my family and I tried to check in online, and customer service ignored all request. Then, they refused to give us seats and arrange to check in our transfer flight. We were furthur told to go to 2 different counters, the b***h telling us to contact a VA, without telling us which one, what their number was, and I flipped. She then did everything I told her in about 30 seconds! The staff were too lazy to do a 30 second job! To wrap it up, I think I have a new motto for them, "Cathay Pacific, Charging you a premium price for the brand you used to believe in, and destroying that with less that budget airline service before your trip even started, Cathay, we don't give a damn." Just ride Singapore Airlines.

Also, too many fashion shops, much to my irritation, but who am I to judge? I reccomend trying Hong Kong Day for a fast food style Hong Kong food, or crystal jade (next to Hong Kong Day) for great dumplings or noodles. The cinema is ok, great prices for 2D but 3D not worth it.

My friend was an example of this, and just spent the two hours on his phone in the gift shop. Therefore, unkess you love or have interest in the history of the DDR, this may be an unsuitable museum to visit.

I found that the depiction of various religious figures. This visit was very interesting for me, as it was supposingly the first gothic building in England, according to our guide. It was a great experience to view some relatively intact sculptures at a cathedral, as in Hong Kong, it is quite difficult to find some preserved religious structures. Half the time a church would just be housed in a normal building! I hope that all of you reading this who wants a taste of rich religious history can one day experience it like I did.
Anon Z|22B6B90693062146573A4DC3F19CE4E5|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Zoo|5| “Awesome Zoo”|review_463718488|This is pretty good zoo. It's one of the few zoos around where animals have relatively more freedom than the caged ones we usually see. You can see the behavior of many of the animals is very similar to what is expected of them in the wild. Also the number of animals is much more than I anticipated (there's even polar bear and penguins). You may need an entire day to explore it completely. There are proper sheds over walkways, so you don't have to worry about cover if it rains and you didn't bring an umbrella. Special events are also organised for some of the animals where they do some stunts and other stuff (don't worry, it's perfectly safe for the animals). One of the other highlights was "Zoorasic park"- as they call it, where they have robotic dinosaurs, it's pretty cool as they look pretty realistic. You have choice on how you want to explore the zoo- on foot or open mini bus type vehicles (don't remember the exact name). The zoo is really big and I recommend taking the mini bus as it is less tiring and time saving. It's definitely worth a visit.

There are well lit walking paths if you want to explore on foot or you can take the mini buses type vehicles (don't remember exactly what they're called) which will move along and pause at certain points where you can see the animals. We took the latter and it was really good and saves a lot of time and energy. Definitely you should not miss this on your trip to Singapore.

Thumping sound of your heart once you board the Formula Rossa is a feeling that is best experienced in person. For those of you who do not have what it takes to ride this beast can try the Fiorano GT Challenge, which does not do any 360. Apart from the roller coasters the park also has lots to offer for little kids, especially those who love cars. I would definitely recommend the park for all thrill seekers and Adrenaline Junkies.The park is also running a program for customer of Abu Dhabi's national airline Etihad. I got free 1-day 2 park pass for me and my wife for Ferrari World and Yas Waterworld. So checkup their website for more promotions and offers.

Roughly 600m scenic route, which also comes with a tavelator. The entry point is located at Level 1 of Vivocity mall near Tung Lok Signatures restaurant. Most ppl pay extra when they use the Sentosa Express (SGD4) or a taxi (SGD2-6) for getting to Sentosa Island. This is the best way to access Sentosa Island Water Front Station, free of cost.
adithyaanuroop|CC6365354FC17111396B487F104D02EC|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|5| “How to get your money's worth at USS”|review_456657966|Enough has been said about the rides and attractions at USS so let me know just give you some tips on how to get there, where to store your backpack, how to save money, where to eat and other hacks. GETTING THERE:* We took a cab to Sentosa Island on our first day, While chatting with the cab driver, he used the phrase "everything is money my friend" which I experienced firsthand. From your research you might already arrived at a conclusion that getting inside sentosa involves an entry fee either through Sentosa Express (SGD4), taxi (SGD2-6, based on time of entry) or own car. But there is another option for people to enter Sentosa Island without paying anything. Yeah, you guessed it right, its the SENTOSA BOARDWALK. Situated at Level 1 of Vivo City mall, this 500m boardwalk take you to Sentosa Island free of charge and hey, you don't have to walk. Just take the travelator and enjoy the scenery en route. The boardwalk is free of cost upto 31st Dec'17. Its funny how you cannot see a single signboard pointing towards the boardwalk entry point. Get to L1 of Vivo City Mall and pass by the Tung Lok Signatures restaurant to get to the boardwalk.DRINKING WATER* Always carry an bottle with you to avoid purchase of water bottles at extra cost. All the rides have drinking water fountains to fill up on water. This applies to entire Singapore for that matter. We never purchased a bottle of water anywhere during our stay.FREE LOCKERS FOR YOU BACKPACK* You might have come across numerous posts advising you not to carry a backpack in USS since it might be a burden to carry around. Well, who DOESNT need a backpack right? I mean where are you going to store you towels, selfie sticks, change of clothes and snacks (shhhhhhhhh, you might get lucky if you play your cards right ;) )The trick is to keep the weight of the backpack to the bare minimum and use he free lockers available at some places. * There are free backpack storage places but they do come with a catch. They are free for only 45minutes after which you need to pay SGD4. However, there is no limit to the number of times you use the free lockers. All you need to do is check the waiting time for the ride and store the bags accordingly. There is a locker space available in Ancient Egypt section, where you can find the Revenge of the Mummy one of the best rides in USS. Also, it is close to The Lost World (Jurassic Park) where you can hop on the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, another awesome ride. Trick is to find the free locker spaces and use them wisely cos you only need one person to hold your space for the ride, if you catch my drift ;)PONCHO* Weather conditions are as unpredictable as the US Presidential Elections. It might rain anytime, anywhere. You just need to be equipped enough to face it and take advantage of it. Yes, I meant take advantage of it because people don't venture in rain, duh. That is where having a poncho can come to your rescue. Ponchos nothing but plastic raincoats made of thin material which serves its purpose at a much cheaper cost than purchasing an umbrella at USS @ USD10, ONLY. Ponchos are available at 2 for SGD5. You just need to ask for those.FOOD @ USS* Numerous restaurants and food carts are available inside USS but the prices come to an average of SGD10 if you want to purchase anything. It is mentioned clearly that outside food/snacks are not allowed inside but they do not check you bags inside out. They just ask you to open up and show the items inside. So it is up to you to purchase food/snacks/drinks inside USS or sneak some inside *wink wink*TIPS:1. Finish all the popular rides like Battle Star Galactica (sci-fi city, roller coaster), Revenge of the Mummy (Ancient Egypt), Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure and Canopy Flyer (The Lost World), during the lunch break when the waiting times are less. 2. Checkout the timings of shows like Waterwold (The Lost World), Sesame Street (New York) and be there ahead of time to beat the queue.3. Try to plan your visit during the middle of the week like Tues, Wed. Waiting time might climb to even 90minutes during peak season and public holidays.4. Get a Universal Express entry pass if you want to beat the line, not applicable only for a few rides.If you research and plan your trip to USS properly, you can get the maximum out it. Definitely would recommend to everyone across different age groups.

Accessible via metro (Al Ras metro station, just one stop away from Al Gubaiba) as well as by bus. Gold Souk comprises of numerous shops selling almost identical designs of gold and silver jewelry. A single piece of gold jewelry, designed to adorn the entire body a damsel is capable of mesmerizing every Tom, Dick & Harry :) We did not go inside the shops, only did some window shopping and took pictures. This is a paradise for gold lovers who are capable of making a good bargain and a nightmare for ppl who want to buy gold without the idea of prices and stuff. There is a store at the end by the name Kanz Jewels which showcases a ring, holding the Guiness Record for the Largest Ring, weighing 64KG. You can find it at the end of the street at the left side corner. The Spice Souk is a 5min walk from Gold Souk. Again, all these spices are native to the Asian continent and is nothing new. But for the tourists hailing from other continents it an orgasm for your nose. The streets are filled with spice merchants selling various spices from across the world and termed it as 'Arabian Spices'. The stores also sell Saffron, a spice with numerous health benefits apart from being used as a coloring/flavoring agent. It is pricey though, 10 dhirams/gram...

I decided to go with desert rose after seeing the reviews in Tripadvisor and boy was it memorable. There are 2 pick up points in Abu Dhabi, Khalidiyah Mall (1530 hours)and carrefour (1600 hours). They pick you up in a Toyota coaster van (air conditioned, of course) till the desert point which is a good 45min drive from Abu Dhabi towards Dubai. From there you are shifted into Toyota Landcruiser SUVs which can accomodate 6 +1. The trip included the following:Dune Bashing: The SUVs gather in a group of 4 or 5 and start the journey bash the hell out the dunes :) the 45min drive through the dunes was exhilarating and pushes your adrenaline into overdrive. The fear of capsizing grips you throughout the entire duration of the activity. You'll be driven to a camel farm to take pictures with the camel and to surprisingly the farm dint have the usual stench, was kept clean. They stop at a place for facilitating the tourists to take pictures of the amazing landscape.Desert camp: After the dune bashing you are taken to the camp site where you have the liberty of taking a camel ride, quadbiking, unlimited coffee/tea/milk/beverage, dates, trying on traditional dress, henna tattoos, BBQ dinner, soft drinks, shisha smokinh and belly dance. All these are complimentary and built into the price of the coupon. Alcoholic beverages are available at extra cost. BBQ dinner was somewhat satisfactory. It would have been nice if the food was kept hot. Vegetarian food was also available. complimentary beverages include water, pepsi/coke, mirinda, orange juice etc., Belly dance will a different for ppl who are witnessing it for the first time. Word of advise, dont sit in the front or the dancer will ask you join her randomly ;) towards the end of the performance, the dancer invited everyone to join her and it was real fun. After the dance performance, they bring out the Hookahs for smoking. The person who was setting up the pipe told me that it was a herbal shisha and is non-tobacco form of Hookah and is completely nicotine free. It's your judgement call whether to go ahead or not. Anyway, smoking once, in a vacation is not gonna kill you unless you get 'Hooked' to 'Hookah', get it? :DYou will be taken back to your vans by around 2100 hours and you will be dropped off at the pick up sites. Overall, it was an awesome and enjoyable experience. Would definitely recommend it for all.
adithyaanuroop|CC6365354FC17111396B487F104D02EC|Hotel|Coonoor: MGM Hill Worth Resorts|4| “Value for money”|review_302108924|Visited MGM Hillworth during the Independence Day weekend. All resorts in ooty were booked out. Same was the case with Masinagudi, the next best thing. So was looking for some resorts in Coonoor the next next best thing after ooty ;) Came across this resort via tripadvisor and I've never been let down till date. The resort manager Mr.Ravi was such a nice and caring person. He was kind enough to pick us from the railway station, which was less than 2km from the property. Rooms: they have only 2 types of rooms, suite and grandeur room. We had opted for a grandeur with AP meal plan. Opt for the one in 2nd floor, 301 if possible. The view was really great through the glass walls with window. The room starts with a small foyer which leads onto the bedroom/living room. Bathroom and toilet are two separate rooms, which is good if you are staying as a family. The room is equipped with a TV, Heater, couple of chairs, an antique table and no mini bar. Rooms have a concrete flooring with a wooden finish. Bed was cozy, can't complain. Ooty-mettupalayam toy train can be viewed through the windows of the rooms facing the valley. Hotel Grounds: The property had a small lawn/garden with space for a couple of tables for dining and a fireplace for the night. Garden was well maintained and neat. The staff can arrange for a campfire, on request. Located off the main road, the property is built on an elevated plane giving it a locational advantage.Restaurant: They do have an an in house restaurant which serves continental, tandoori and South Indian, veg and non-veg. Since we were on AP plan we had all 3 meals in the restaurant. All the food items were reasonably good. Unfortunately we did not get continental during our stay. Room service is available throughout the day. Plan your order 1 hour in advance and place it accordingly since they're swamped with orders for most part of the day, especially dinner.Recreation: they have limited recreational activities. Only badminton, carom and chess board.Restaurants in Coonoor:The Hyderabadi House- an epitome of don't judge a book by its cover. This restaurant is a haven for Hyderabadi biriyani lovers. Must visit places in coonoor:Sims park- A 12 Hectare colorful garden decorated with beautiful flowers at nook and cranny of the entire park. Apt for a romantic walk with your loved one(s).Dolphin Nose- This spectacular viewpoint is just 10km from coonoor making it more accessible from coonoor than ooty. Breathtaking views and splendid climate are to say the least. Ooty- the queen of hill stations is roughly a 20km bike ride from coonoor. If you plan to visit ooty you start early in the morning to avoid traffic.The famous Toy Train operating between Ooty and Mettupalayam station passes through Coonoor. I'd highly recommend this joy ride for everyone right from born infants to grown infants. Passing through caves, lush greenery and breathtaking view of the mountains this is a highly recommended mode of travel between ooty and Coimbatore.The shortcomings of the property are very well overcome by the hospitality of the staff especially the manager Mr.Ravi. Do ask for him if you're planning on booking your stay.

If you go by bus (Transjakarta) you need to take off at Balaikota halte and you'll find the gate immediately. You can take a carriage that will carry you to the monument entrance because it's a little too far to walk, especially if you come too late in the afternoon, because they only open util 4PM. The entrance is a bit confusing for foreign tourists so make sure to ask. The entrance fee is quite cheap, only around 1 dollar usd to enter the monument and go up to the peak. The museum was a bit too dark. And the queue to the peak was long even in weekday. I think it will be better if you go here in the morning.

Bags, glasses, clothes, snacks, and lots of cheap souvenirs. One thing is, you need to do your best to bargain the price they give if there is no price tag on the item. Sometimes the items are actually cheap so bargaining is necessary.

It was near Chinatown so if you want to shop you only need to leave the hotel from the back door and you already in Chinatown. I see so many delicious looking food and it's cheap but too bad I can't taste it since I have no time. Even though it's near popular attraction, the hotel is still comfortable to sleep. I was staying when it's new year's eve and could sleep well.

First, I thought you have to pay to enter the garden but it's actually free, except you want to use car that drives around the garden or if you want to enter Flower Dome, or some indoor gardens. Second, I came when there was Christmas Wonderland, a light and music performance for christmas special, It was really nice to see!

I first tried Transformers since it's indoor, and then I tried Battlestar Galactica Human, it was not really scary as I thought. If you want more extreme you should try Cylon one. The revenge of the mummy was a really nive experience because you ride roller coaster indoor and dark. it was really good.

You can jog around here, of course. The information about the plants is clear enough, they have so many kinds of garden. My favorite was foliage garden, because there were many pretty plants with pretty leaves.

The room was clean and comfortable, the location is near a chinese restaurant and the food there was delicious, in front of the hotel there is a mall so you can shop your necessities, and the best of all, there is a bus stop to Singapore across the hotel. and There's one staff who's really helping us. We are big family so we have many bags with us. He helped us to bring some bags until the bus stop. If you're planning to go to Singapore, will be good to stay here.
Mandie B|D2B0F95D752A193F191E2F050E12B3FC|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|5| “Fun filled family day - Sad about the rain!”|review_456620861|We had a great time at Universal Studios Singapore. It was fun rides for the whole family, great food and loads to see and explore. It was a bit humid and warm on arrival but this soon changed as we were about 1/4 into the park. It started raining...more like pouring down with thunder galore. This was such a pity because the whole park comes to a standstill and all except 2-3 rides stop working if there is thunder accompanying the rain. Luckily we went prepared with some ponchos in our bags, but even this was not enough for the down pouring because we were walking around in water about ankle high. We ultimately missed about 2-3 hours in our day just standing around under shelter waiting for the rain to subside which eventually did but because there was still thunder warnings the park remained to close the rides. I would def visit this park again, I would just plan to miss the rain and go on a sunny day. But seeing that Singapore has rain pretty much everyday I don't know why the creators didn't plan for the park to be more equipped to function in the rain or accommodate their visitors. We flew into Singapore and only had the one day to make Universal Studios work, so sad for us. And you pay quite a bit for tickets, so again...make it work for the visitors and instead having 80% of the park under rain and only 20% under roof in a tropical place with rain all the time....the math is a bit off I should say. It just leaves sad faces on kids that had been excited for this visit for weeks. What did save us was the booking of tickets online and the express passes. We only bought the package allowing one express pass and this helped us getting most of the rides in once the park opened fully again. The ques were endless since it was over peak season. So well worth the extra couple of bucks paid. We had our 5, 10, 16 yrs old boys with us. Got some great shots to remember and relived some of the family favorite movies!!

Find yourself a vendor...they are all good, find a spot on one of the many tables laid out in the middle of the street and go to town ordering your food. Although it is very pricey for street food, the experience is all worth it. Maybe grab a small bite to eat at a cheaper place and just go for some nibbles afterwards at the Satay street food vendors. Also, make sure to take lots of wet-wipes, because you end up with satay all over. ;)
Mandie B|D2B0F95D752A193F191E2F050E12B3FC|Attractions|Singapore: Night Safari|2| “Not worth the money and distance”|review_456134426|This was such a disappointing trip, too much money spend not only in taxi fees to get there but also for what we got to see. Because we wanted to skip the long lines at the ticket box we booked and payed our tickets online. We were given a slot to enter the park. Making sure not to miss out on anything, we arrived at the gates 2 hours before our actual scheduled time. We wanted to grab a bite to eat before starting the tour. But there were so many people that it took us that 2 hours to just get into the park at our allocated time slot. Becasue of overcrowding we had to wait in lone lines to see the animal show and to get to ride the guided ride. This was such a shamed because we ended up not even seeing half the park before we were asked to started exiting the park a half and hour before the advertised closing time. We went all the way, spend all that money and only got to see half of it, because of crowing we could'nt even enjoy the fire breathers show. The park is stunning and the animals very interesting to experience at night. But due to the park taking and allowing for number of visitors to enter, many people left complaining. I guess this is what greed does, they make their money and don;t really care if the visitors fully enjoy what they paid for. Afterwards we had to wait for quite some time for a taxi to arrive. The food was also not worth it, huge portions but absolutely tasteless. We tried the burger joint to the left of the gate entrance. We could've definitely enjoyed other attractions in Singapore than to have wasted our precious time at this place.

Loved walking this road during day and night, so many shops and malls that are accessible and within walking distance.

The food is enjoyable that is on offer at the market stalls and off coarse the highlight being the lights show when the sun goes down.

It is located in a beautiful park surrounded by lots of greenery. We were thoroughly entertained while being educated on the history and journey Singapore had to go through during the II World War. Our boys ages 5, 10, 16 all enjoyed the experience and was always captured by the presentation. The guide was very informative and did a really good job at retelling this very important history lesson. Will definitely recommend this tour.

Mac banana has something for everyone. We started our day with a hearty breakfast that was well worth the money with a generous portion of bacon and bottomless coffee/tea. Then it was off to feed the animals at the petting zoo. We booked a Banana Tour that took about an hour to complete starting with a tour of the place to the butterfly dome and the store rooms filled with the sweet smell of bananas ending the tour with a sample of homemade banana bread and fresh farm bananas. After this much education we had a good round of mini golf at a lovely and well kept facility. We ended our day with giant pancakes (crepes) fit for royalty. The premises are so well kept and clean, not to mention gorgeous surrounding. A must for any family looking for a fun day out. There is also a little farm stall shop with loads of goodies for sale.

The bottle of wine we ordered tasted bitter and the food was tasteless. We ordered the seafood platter for two that was not too bad except for the calamari rings that was dry. For appetizers we ordered the risotto and seafood paella, the risotto was mediocre but at least had some taste to it, the paella was sloppy with a puddles of oil all over the plate, the rice undercooked and absolutely no seasoning...it was in desperate need of some more saffron, lots of garlic and spice, half the ingredients that was mentioned on the menu was not even in the dish. To end it off we ordered the molten lava cake and what a disappointment once again with the cake being cold and dry, in fact as someone having experience and training in pastry myself this seemed to be a plain ring cake baked in a mould with chocolate sauce poured into the center, sealed with some melted chocolate and then heaped with ice cream.... I didn't even bother to waste my calories and finished both the main and dessert! With such a beautiful setting and atmosphere they will do good by stepping up there flavors in the food and a little more smile from the servers!

The service and friendliness was above standard and they really make the little ones feel welcome and entertained as where most other lodges don't. The game drives was really professionally done, one guide that stood out was Wessel who was very informative on every animal we encountered and even stopped to gave the occasional survival tip or two. Really up close to the animals, the highlight of coarse is the lions, just spectacular animals. This lodge is passionate about it's animals and surroundings as well as keeping nature projected and as it's intended to be...wild and free!! Will definitely visit them again!!

Have to say the place looks much bigger on TV than real life, but still had as much magic with loads of buzz happening.

The ladies dressed in matching era clothing that hostes you in each house you stop at, is very informative...do take some small change to leave them a something for their effort, it really is appreciated very much.

But the friendliness off the owner and welcoming decor make up for it and you still leave satisfied with a box filled with delicious imported Belgium chocolates. Worth visiting for some on the road sweetness.

We had spectacular views with crisp blue skies and not a cloud to be seen. The park is maintained very well and clean. A bit nerve wrecking going up the cable car but that's just due to severe fear of heights but they do have a little spot in the middle of the car for the nervous travelers to sit down..my family had a ball going up the car. Check the Table Mountain app or website for minute updates for weather, visibility and most important if they are open since the mountain can get covered in mist very quickly and then they have to close for safety reasons. A must do when you're in the Mother City CT!!

I was really impressed with this self catering unit we stayed in as the kitchen was equipped with everything and anything you would need, there is cleaning services everyday which is such a delight since who wants to do dishes when you're on holiday right! All the staff was very friendly and professional. Will definitely recommend Under Milkwood to any family on vacation!! Two thumbs up!!

Best activity in Phuket.”|review_276490455|We recently spend a week in Phuket and wanted to do and see as much as possible. Purely from over hearing conversations from other guests that tagged along on various tour trips, we came across Two Sea Tour. We booked our trip online (since this is the normal way this company works to give better and more accurate service to their clients). Although the trip starts bright and early in the morning and you might have to skip your usual hotel bfast but boy it is sooo worth all that effort to beat the crowds of people bombarding the Islands and experience nature in it's true form and serenity. Philipp who is the co-owner of the company is a very friendly guy with loads of knowledge of the area and also very passionate about Thailand and preserving its true beauty. As we visited various Islands the crew made sure to collect as much rubbish left from other tour groups and companies in an effort to make the trip and the scenery better for all who visit these gorgeous places. All the staff (paddle men) where very friendly, helpful and very entertaining throughout the trip. The bfast snacks and buffet lunch that was served on the boat was also fabulous. The trip might cost a bit more than other tour companies but well worth every penny. This is a much recommended tour for anyone looking for a truly memorable experience in Thailand. Thank you to Philipp and his crew for a fantastic day out at sea!!!!!!

I didn't find the staff very accomodating and had no interest in finding out from the kitchen for me certain ingredients and the way food was cooked to be safe for my pregnancy. I just expected so much better. This is was the only restaurant I had a bad experience at, the whole time I was pregnant. I don't like writing bad reviews and this is only ever my second one that I have negatively written about. I should have though let the restaurant know though back at the time of the event. As my title states though disappointed and I still am.

The beach area the water is flat and shallow and just walking distance there is a area roped off to prevent swimmers from sharks if any come into the area. The shops and in town is walking distance plus many wineries and places to eat just out of town not too far away to drive to. I am going to at least book 1 week away here every year. Accomodation would be perfect and plenty big enough for 2 families to share here to make it cheaper to stay.

Room 314”|review_479928524|As far as i traveled into deferent boutique hotels this one was not really one of them. Its kind of a normal hotel i did not feel especially in the room as i was in something deferent then a normal hotel. The room was spacious and nice bed mattress and pillow was relaxing, tv size was small .. i liked the welcoming fruits and free water it shows generosity. Food taste was great in room service and the portion was perfect. My only comment was the sound proof walls .. i can hear everything goes on in the next room !! I called the help disk couple of times to call the other room and tell them to lower the tv at 3 am ..

The river was not surrounding the big pool or the wave pool !! Simply its waste of time and many teenagers there, the wave pool was one of the smallest if compared to SunwayLagoon in Kuala Lumpur or any normal size waterpark in the usa or dubai. Only 3 rides as adventure the others are kids stuff .. the food was also poor. All junk food I did not enjoy Positives : rainbow reef aquarium

We started from the entrance then went left for kids at far far away land then jerrasic park land then Egypt lands then sci fic where transformers are, in between them both lovely roller coasters very fast, then we ended at new York lands, for more fun i advice you at the entrance to buy the fast track where its very very useful we couldn't finish all zones at one day without it.. each ride that takes 45 m waiting line it took us 5 min to ride .. plus if you are single you can also use the fast track express as a single rider in most rides. Water lands opens at 3 pm .. also look at the schedule of the shows and try to catch up especially in new york the dancing band are very good. I didnt buy anything from stores to not carry many toys and gifts because the universal store at the gate have almost everything and every character u will see inside, so i bought when i was leaving just next to the gate, out side you can find some nice restaurants for dinner. Park starts from 10 am to 9 pm Wish you a happy experience

We went around noon the zoo is a bit confusing at first when you enter but then you get used to it, started at the dinosaurs area then saw that big polar bare and some different animals like bearded-pigs and long nick turtles. I like how each company sponsored an animal .. you will see a sign that this animal is supported by x company. My kids loved it.

Then when i arrived the concierge did not wait for me to chick in before he started saying that shisha is not allowed in this hotel !! I was surprized and disappointed that they allow busboy and car driver talk to the guests !!Anyway i carried on it was 8 pm a busy time and another disappointment where only one receptionist was on and he was helping another person, i had to keep asking him 3 times until finally he called his friend and they checked me in after 20 min, the suite was nice. But then a surprising phone call on my mobile from head of security manager mobile where he kept telling me not to smoke shisha on the hotel room and how sensitive are the firealarm system bla bla bla then he said that they have orders from the government thats not allowed , where in all jeddah 5 stars hotels like Hilton, Sheraton and Park Hayat shisha are allowed in smoking suites and i had never faced such an issue. Anyway our night went on unhappy.Again i had asked the reservation for late checkout at 3pm he told me its ok, and when i checked in i asked the receptionist for the same thing, though i get a phone call at 12 pm asking me to evacuate the suite at 1 pm and that time i was sleeping and they didnt respect the dont disturb button on the system. Very poor employers unprofessional very young boys. When i checked out i told the receptionist what happened regarding the security person and the shisha then he clarified to me that it is ok to smoke shisha they just afraid so the carpet wont burn!! I told him you could of asked for a deposit for that. !! In conclusion i will not come back for sure never to this hotel, very bad management .. i advise to go to hilton where is one of the top professionals service you will get .. bye bye rose wood hotel

The moment you enter it makes you forget ur in jeddah and take you to USA aquariums as in florida or California. The fishes and the big tanks and the sharks the kids wear screaming all the time out of excitement, if ur in jeddah you should go, one negative thing was the restaurant had a waiting que of an hour we couldn't wait, it happened twice with us. The dolphin show for the next visit was extremely joyful .. Thank you jeddah aquarium management for keeping up with international standards

I reserved by phone suite 714 and when i arrived the lady at the reception gave me another suite at the 4th floor and when i told her i hd reserved the 714 suite she told me it was occupied and i didn't like that .. The 714 with a balcony and a great sea view with the bridge and the mosque the one on the 4th floor not the same at all .. The good thing I went down again and told the manager what happened and he helped out and gave me the 714 suite !! So it wasn't occupied as the lady said!! Anyway i was happy and felt relieved from the stress she had put me on and enjoyed my stay here .. I will add some pics of the great room view .. The suite 714 is worth every dollar was spent on .. 2 flat TV with a great living room and espresso machine and a working disk and a dining table.. The closets were spacious and the bathroom was made of marble it felt like a palace bathroom with a large bathtub with a large window for a nice view while taking a shower. Breakfast buffet was a bit disappointing not that many selection but all in all it was ok. I wished it had more traditional turkish breakfast. The lobby is nice with a bar in the middle on the sea view directly.Fitness center is ok a bit small but if ur an athlete you will know how to adjust the tools to ur needs. The spa and the barber shop also their but I did not try them.The surrounding of the hotel is great where by walking distance you have many coffee shops and bars and night clubs. I came here last year and this is my second time in the radisson blue and will not be the last one for sure. Thanks to the manager again for helping out.

New concept new decor. Be the first to try it out.

There is a lot of traffic as many tourists coming and going. But the horses are respected. We cannot go close to the horses. The guide is very attuned and knowledgeable with the habits of the horses. The camp is a bit old in terms of shower facilities.

Unfortunately, it was raining that day. Although we are well protected from the rain, the bicycle rickshaw rider is not. Yet he gave us a tour explaining the history of the buildings.

Response from them is quick and they are very accommodating. You can tell them what you'd like to do and they will customized your tour for you. Flexible when you make changes. Jenna responded to all my email queries patiently. She is so good that I had a good feeling that Catherine Lu tour is going to be my choice. The guide Harper is knowledgeable of China history. She makes every building come alive with the rich history behind it. If not for her guided tour, I would not have appreciated every monument or enjoyed Beijing without her. She lets us take our time appreciating every place of interest and soak in the atmosphere of her history telling. Mr Lu and another driver are always waiting for us with a smile and cold water whenever we get into his car. Catherine Lu tour is really professional at every level. There is a reason why they are number one.

We all had a starter and a main from the early dining menu, approximately £17. Some cost a little extra. Some of the portion sizes are very small, but very tasty. All the food was well presented and everything was eaten, so, obviously we were all happy! Portion sizes could be bigger, it wouldn't go amiss to put a bit more veg on the plates, but would definitely return.

The only criticism is that far too many people are in here at once, making it virtually impossible to even walk through the tunnel at one point. Perhaps a moving floor would help, so that there is not a blockage in here, where people don't walk through quickly enough. Souvenir photos are too expensive, I feel. Nice day though, worth a visit.

Disgraceful experience!”|review_456534646|Went here at the end of December as a party of four. On the way in, we asked about the price of "fast pass" tickets and it was 80 dollars each. Quite expensive on top of tickets, so had a think about it. Within ten minutes of asking the price, we went to buy them, only to be told they were now 100 dollars each! Unbelievable, but apparently this is normal practice. If the place is busy, they hike up the price. Absolutely disgraceful! Have been to Universal studios in other countries, have never known this happen. Also, couldn't use a lot of the rides due to the weather being bad, bug they don't offer a reduction in the price!
m r|9B2CF4B7471180F7E06719665F57E6B0|Hotel|Singapore: Amara Singapore|3| “Overpriced.”|review_454100056|On arrival from england, was disappointed to find that the adjoining rooms we had requested were not available. After a lot of messing around, was given two rooms, with two double beds instead of one double and one with singles, so had to change again. As we were awaiting the arrival of my 15 year old niece from New Zealand, who did not want to sleep in the same bed as her cousin, I was not impressed. We ended up with rooms on the same floor, but far apart. The rooms need a serious update, the bath and cupboards in bathrooms are old, scruffy and dated. Chipped in parts. Considering I paid approximately £1350 for 5 nights, room only, I would have expected better quality. There was very little information given on arrival, so did not even realise there was a shopping area with restaurants at the back of the hotel. Staff need to make guests aware of what is available. Bar was closed very early of an evening, even residents could not get a drink. Think it was around 11 o'clock. The bar prices are very high. Was extremely surprised to find that when we purchased a short drink on its own, we were charged the same price as when we bought with a mixer! When questioned, the barman just said that it is the standard price, with or without mixer! Pool was beautiful, not warm enough though. The gym was adequate. The hotel is quite close to tram station, so easy to get to other places easily. Was not good value for money.

None of us had a starter, as we wanted to save room for desert. We had four different main meals, and can only say, each meal was presented beautifully, as well as tasting amazing. We were given a tray of olives, crisps and breads free of charge to start, plus a bottle of water - nice touch! The fish platter was to die for, but would have been pleased with anything served here. The deserts were fantastic too, I had the "banana" platter, which had lots of small portions of banana flavoured treats. The wine was reasonably priced too. Not one complaint from seven women, well done! Ha. The staff were really pleasant too, the restaurant was extremely busy, but still a lovely atmosphere. We all thought it was one of the nicest meals we had eaten in a long time. Not cheap, but we felt that it was excellent value for money.

The venue is absolutely beautiful, it is a treat for the eyes. Ticket prices were reasonable. Hate to complain about such a lovely place, but the bar area is not good, seats and tables are old and wobbly. Need replacing and the area needs a good overhaul to make it a more pleasant experience. The bar prices are too expensive. All the alcoholic drinks were £4 each, apart from cider, which was £5 per bottle. Suppose it saves on having a till to work out the prices! Would definitely go again, but would go and have a drink somewhere else first.

Ordered steak, which came with chips when I ordered baked potato. Then it came with baked potato, but steak was just about Luke warm. Had to send it back to be heated up before I could eat it. It was fatty and not a pleasant experience. My friend had steak which he could not chew and was full of fat. Another friend had chilli con carne, which tasted like bolognaise! Considering the amount of decent places to eat in benidorm, this place needs to up the ante. Very poor quality for the money. Lots of better places to eat for less money too!

Next time, would pick the easier option though, ours was too difficult a game for us to complete. Think a little bar of some kind or coffee machines would be a great idea for the waiting area. Could be cheaper too, but I would return

Went here after a concert with five friends. The food is decent enough, too salty though, but after a visit to the toilet, I couldn't eat a thing. It's disgraceful to say the least. Don't want to eat in a place where the chef has to clean his hands in a dirty bowl, sorry!

Was upgraded to all inclusive for this. We were put in room 710 for our troubles. Excellent amount of storage in room and view was fantastic from balcony. However, all downhill from there. The bathroom needs an immediate re-vamp. The fixtures were falling off the walls due to age, the shower is old and needs replacing. The toilet cistern was boiling hot for some reason and toilet needs replacing due to marks on the top. I tried to pay for a number of things on credit card, such as wi if, trips and safe key, only to be told it was cash only??? Saw other people pay with cards to a different member of staff. 20 euros per device per week is disgraceful, shameful charges, especially if you have phones, iPads etc... Room needed a serious clean, wiped the inside of drawers etc with baby wipes before putting my stuff in, very dusty. Look at top of fridge and inside cupboards, not touched in weeks! The tv, only a couple of channels showing the same news, over and over and over again... Not that we stay in much, but that is ridiculous. The food is passable to say the least, we eat out most days. They ran out of the main courses one night at 8.15! Went back over a twenty five minute period and was not replenished. Bad service. The snacks if a day time looked like left overs from the night before. Uncovered too, full of flies! It rained a few days while we were there, the bar area flooded, making it dangerous and slippy. Our room was leaking by door. Staff look miserable on reception, however, are actually quite pleasant when they feel like. This should not be the way, staff on reception in any hotel, should at least give a smile to guests and a little polite chit chat would not go amiss. The entertainment leaves a lot to be desired too, the all inclusive stops at eleven, even after that, we could not buy a drink! Unbelievable. Have never been in such a miserable hotel, was like being in a nursing home. The pool is freezing and very few places to sit in the sun. As you can imagine, we were out as much as possible. The hotel is tired, with half baked attempts of repairs. The red carpet on the stairs was filthy most days. We walked down every day, so noticed this. The hallways are gloomy too. I would rate this as a poor 3 star. Your young man on the bar is a credit to you, don't lose him!

The house itself had silly attractions inside, boring, boring, boring. Looked like they were rejects from other theme parks. The 3d attractions outside were extremely short, about three minutes if I remember rightly. The queues were very long, too long to wait for such a minimal amount of amusement. Had a very mediocre "meal" too - cold, overfried chips and burger. Didn't even bother with the mini golf, as the queue was at least an hour and a half wait. Can't imagine what it must be like in the busy season. Don't waste your money. Wouldn't even go if I had the children with me.

Hooched were a brilliant duo, could watch them over and over. Some of their songs were repeated over different nights, but still very good. Guitar playing was very impressive! Loved the joking about too and involving the audience, well done. Thought the manager was excellent , he runs a tight ship and it shows! The waitresses and bar staff were all on the ball, brilliant service with a smile. Cocktails were amazing too, and I'm not a big drinker! Keep up the good work!

Have been twice before, but thought we'd give it a try with new management and decor. Firstly, looks lovely inside and is really clean. There was not very much of an atmosphere. We sat down, ordered drinks and meal, very little interaction from staff. Although I don't want somebody going over the top, a little bit of chit chat from waiters is usually nice and makes you feel comfortable. I had humus for starter and lamb kebab ( kuzu shish). The bread was beautiful, could have eaten it all night. The main meal was over salted and not very enjoyable, the rice was unpleasant, bit like rice pudding in texture and not a nice flavour. I have this meal every time I go to the other Elif in lark lane, always beautifully cooked and seasoned properly. However, I do appreciate that we all like different things, so I would not want to put anyone off trying here. The thing that would put me off from going again, was that we had one drink all the way through our meal, neither waiter came over once to take a drinks order! Most restaurants are quick to take drinks orders, even just to make more money for them, so for that reason, will not go back again.

Haven't been for a couple of years, so thought we'd give it a go. Decor still gloomy looking, the toilets have improved, although so dark you can't apply make up if you want. Can't believe there is a charge for the car park. However, my impression was that it is scruffy and staff should be taught to tidy around. One waiter walked past a large spoon on the floor eight times while we were there! Unbelievable. There were dirty napkins on window ledges which were not removed and tables left uncleared. This would certainly put me off eating there. Either get more staff or let the people working there know how to clean up.

Was certainly impressed again. It seems to have been re vamped since I went last time, looks really nice. The staff are lovely and very helpful. The food was beautiful again, think most things on the menu looked great. The sesame ice cream was delicious. Well worth a visit if you are in the area. Prices are not bad either. Lots of people were popping in for takeaways.

The hotel is quite modern with a very chilled out atmosphere. We had a room on 6 th floor with a sea view, beautiful! Was fantastic listening to the sea day and night. The beds face the window, so it was great to look out while still in bed. Great idea! Bathroom was nice, not fantastic, bit of a smell from the drain and the shower was a nightmare to use. Had a sofa bed in room too, so you could have brought people back to sleep if you wanted. The restaurant was really nice, with great staff. Well done to frank, the maître d, what a lovely guy, so helpful and great at his job. The food was lovely, plenty to suit most tastes. Didn't see the same thing more than once! Found it amazing that we were never asked for room number on entry. There were light snacks to help yourself to, most times throughout the day, with a sangria on tap all day! The alcohol was not the local stuff, but genuine brands, and rather large measures. We didn't drink very much, but sure you can get as much as you want. Wine at meals was given by the bottle too. There is a lounge area on roof top and heated pool. We were entitled to use of spa which had another pool, sadly didn't get time to use it. Was a really nice hotel, would definitely return here. Cost about eight euros for cab to centre of bars, but is quite easy to walk if you like. The only fault we found, was that on arrival, the information given about the hotel and use of card was a bit vague - a written sheet would be helpful :0)

The disabled room was absolutely beautiful, a lovely wet room, but also a bath near to the bed. The room was spotlessly clean, the decoration impeccable . We could only access the room through the back entrance of the hotel, which was not a problem, as the staff were fantastic, bringing us to the room and not rushing us. My room was nearly identical to the disabled room, but with a normal shower and also we had the roll top bath. The decoration of the whole hotel is fantastic , very quirky, lots of weird and wonderful things to look at - fantastic design. The garden are was beautiful too, not very big, but little areas with heated lights above you. Great , even in cold weather. We sat in a little "snug", had a few drinks and thoroughly enjoyed it. The manager was brilliant, helping us lift my mother in law, and provided an armchair for her to enable her to sit comfortably in the restaurant - a big thanks for that, was much appreciated. The breakfast was gorgeous , we all had a full English. We had our evening meal there, would highly recommend, it was not cheap, but was worth every penny, would eat here again even if I was not staying here. The only fault I could find, was that the door on the disabled room shut far too quickly, especially if mobility is poor. Maybe if you had a very large wheelchair, it may be a struggle getting around the corridor to the room. We will definitely be returning. The hotel is fantastic and all of the staff were nothing less than perfect. Their attitude was impeccable, for such young people, they were so helpful. Jake was a lovely guy, who helped us on arrival. A big pat on the back to all of you, and thanks once again for helping us get about with my mother in law, it was really appreciated x

The position of the hand rails to go up the stairs obscures the view of the stage. I am only small, so had to try and look over or under the rails. People sat in front of me were doing the same. Obviously , this is not for every seat, but just check when booking as it is quite irritating , especially when one pays out nearly £80 for a ticket

We both had the chicken kebab, hanging from a skewer. Very small amount of chicken. Chips were nice, although not very warm. We then had a hanging desert of strawberry and marshmallows with chocolate sauce. Nice, but once again, not a lot of strawberries and held on with a lemon, very bitter taste when not expected. Liked the beer choice in little book, very cute, even though I'm not a beer drinker really. The place was extremely dark, to the point of being quite depressing. The wallpaper was peeling, don't know whether that is meant to be that way? Looks scruffy! Went here on recommendation and was very disappointed, as I expected a beautiful hanging kebab, but very average. Don't want to put people off going, as each to their own. Cost roughly £50 for four drinks, two meals and two deserts. I would not return here, very average food. Staff were very nice.

The hotel is very nice indeed, reception staff and entertainment staff are great. Cleaners are very polite. Restaurant staff are nice enough, but could do with a bit more interaction. The food is lovely, but we like to eat out too, as we get bored quite quickly with choosing bits of this and that. But that is not a complaint, there are plenty of nice things to choose from every day. The gym was quite small. The entertainment was very hit and miss, only two decent acts while we were there. The resident pianist should be sacked though, don't know how anyone could make a song sound nothing like what it was supposed to be, at one point, he had his hand on top of the piano and never seemed to touch the keys or even the foot pedals with his feet, even though music kept playing - AMAZING! Come on now, he is awful and his replacement on night off was not up to much either! There were lots of same sex couples here at the hotel, thought that was great . Was nice to see that, and for that reason alone, I would recommend the hotel to a lot of my friends and family. The area around the hotel is very dated, looks like it would have been great about twenty years ago, very tired looking! Lots of places were shut and looked very scruffy. Bar staff were literally dragging you in with the offer of free drinks to try and get you into the bars. Went down to the beach, same agin, very scruffy and tired looking, needs a complete revamp! At least four transvestite prostitutes in the road opposite the hotel every night, that is only to let people know who may be concerned by this. However, these ladies did not approach passers by or offend in any way. Went to Mogan by taxi for the day and night, as absolutely beautiful there. Extremely clean, friendly people, very busy and lovely restaurants. If I went to gran canaria again, would stay there.

There is a disabled toilet here and they provided us with a chair with arm rests for mum, I know this doesn't sound much, but it is impossible at most places to find somewhere comfortable for her to sit. They were so obliging, nothing was too much trouble. It is the first time that my in laws have suggested going back to any restaurant, they loved it. Lots of families in here, nice atmosphere .I have been here three times now, the food has been beautiful to say the least, would recommend it to anyone. I love Italian food, but the family only like English, but there were still things that they found to their taste. The early doors menu is very cheap, under £16 for three courses, some of the main meals are a bit pricey, around £17 -£26, which I would gladly pay. We had two lots of meals from cheaper menu and two from normal priced menu. Pint of beer was just over four pound, pint if bitter £3.50. Lovely meal once again, thanks to the staff for making mum feel comfortable , will be back again soon :0)

Great dancing and acts too. All of the singers were nice and friendly, all of them very pretty too! Sat on a table of ten people, we didn't know anybody, but by the end of the night, everyone had mixed well. Quality entertainment, the acrobat was fantastic. Well done. Nice evening, would definitely recommend. Best of luck to you all :0) thanks for a good night.

The birds of prey show was fantastic to say the least. Watching them fly into the mountains was a beautiful sight. Meerkats were lovely, enclosure was small for them I thought. Aquarium was amazing. Was raining while we were there on and off, so wise to take an umbrella, we bought cover ups there for 3 euros each. We went as a couple and really enjoyed it, food was decent enough there too.

Had to buy drink on entry whilst waiting to be seated. Bought cocktails whilst in there , 30 euros for four, hardly any alcohol in them - waste of money - avoid! The two girls/ lads were beautiful to say the least and very nice people to talk to. Peggy lee looked good too and very friendly. One of the singers was very good, can't remember the name, sorry! Main gripe is that the show was very dated, one of the parts being about Barbara woodhouse! A lot of the people in there would not even remember her. The penguin act was silly and quite frankly, didn't get the point of it. Was a nice night, but quite expensive for the entertainment part of it. Didn't like the selling of the brochures in aid of Macmillan charity, if people want to donate to a charity, leave it up to them. I donate all the time to my own charities, but don't want to feel pressured on a night out. Photo opportunity was a nice touch and only eight euros. If the show was updated with more people in it, would be a great night. Loved lady ga ga! Best of luck to you all :0)

Was quite small inside, but tables were far enough apart that we didn't feel on top of the next diners. Had two starters, mains, one desert and some drinks. Starters were really nice, mains were great too. I had fish curry, my only gripe was that fish was a bit over cooked . Had one ice cream desert and one baileys coffee. Manager gave us a taster if one of the deserts to try. Very reasonable price for what we had, would go again, not for a special occasion though. Staff were some of the nicest I have met in a long time. Keep it up, it's nice to see staff laughing and enjoying the company of visitors! Would definitely go again, even though I'm not a great fan of Indian food :0)

It's a nice couple of hours for beach combing and playing football, making sand castles etc. Usually get a drink from the vans there ( awful coffee), or ice creams or chips . I always enjoy the fresh air, sometimes take the bikes and cycle along the front. My only down point is the dogs on the beach, and the people who let them run wild. A few dog owners should realise that some people are frightened by these dogs running around them. I love dogs, don't get me wrong, but when we have small children with us, I am always very wary that they may get knocked over or bitten.

The building itself is fantastic, the artwork and furniture are stunning. Absolutely loved it here. There are little areas set out for children and I believe they have special events laid on for the kids. It has a large lift, which will be perfect for us when we return with disabled family members. Couldn't believe that this little treasure was here, it does not receive much publicity. People I have mentioned it to, have not even heard of it before, what a shame , when it is right on our doorstep. It was free of charge too, so a great little find if you are looking for a little afternoon out at low cost. You can give a donation if you want. It truly is an amazing place. The coffee shop had closed when we were there, but will definitely be going back when I have more time to browse properly. The gardens outside are great too, lots of people having picnics and generally having fun.

Have been a few times now and have always had excellent food. The deserts are really nice, even though I'm not too fond of cake, they are all lovely. The Sunday deal for £9.99 for three courses is excellent value. Do think that the drinks could be a bit cheaper though, as this does bump up the cost quite a bit. Can't fault the place though, it is always busy when I have been in the area. We'll done, the other restaurants around you should take note - good food at a good price makes people want to return. :0)

Had lamb tikka for starter, it was tasteless and rubbery with quite a bit of fat. I then had Goan fish curry for main meal. Watery orange colour curry , with tasteless fish. The place had no atmosphere, the music was so low it could barely be heard. The three staff we saw in there, we're not very chatty. They were helpful and pleasant enough, but maybe a little bit of banter with the customers would not go amiss. Not even to ask if our meal was ok was quite unusual. We have been here before, and remember from last time that the ambience was not fantastic, but thought we would try it again. Will not be returning again. It cost over £55 for two starters, two popadoms , two main meals, two beers and one water. Think you need to have a word with the chef, it's no wonder the place was not busy.

The room was beautiful with a large four poster bed. The bathroom was large, with jacuzzi bath, separate shower cubicle, fireplace and TV . Beautifully furnished. Spotlessly clean. The dining room was beautiful too, and we didn't feel like we had to sit and listen to other peoples conversation at breakfast! I liked the fact that the tables weren't too close together! The breakfast was the nicest breakfast I have had anywhere I have ever stayed. I had eggs benedict, but there was a lot of choice. Fresh fruit, cereals etc... The staff were absolutely lovely. There was a bit of a walk into the centre, which I would say is the only down point , not too bad if you are fit, but maybe a bit of a struggle for some. Thanks for a short and sweet stay :0)

We have stayed in hundreds of hotels all around the world, and can honestly say, this is the cleanest we have been in. The mansion house is beautiful, the grounds are gorgeous and the rooms are tastefully furnished and decorated. The dining room is a treat too, the breakfast was lovely. Loved seeing the alpacas, chickens, birds and dog too.Seriously, couldn't fault the owners or the mansion.

All tapas were lovely, in particular, the entrecôte mojo ( steak with sauce), perfectly cooked and the croquettes stuffed with ham and cheese. Deserts were lovely too, all went down well, could possibly be priced a bit lower - £4.95 each. Carlsberg was £3 per pint, which I thought was great, as normally we pay that for bottles in other restaurants. Service charge of 10 percent was added.Definitely coming back.

Went in as I had seen reviews on trip advisor. The food was beautiful, presentation was perfect. The deserts were very large, much appreciated by my partner! We were not rushed at all, even though it was a busy weekend. Everything was cooked to perfection and fresh. The restaurant was very clean. Brilliant value for money too, would have been happy to pay a lot more for what we had.

We were supposedly upgraded to a better room on arrival. The room was very small, with a horrible view of scruffy buildings outside. We were in room 225 and can only assume we were "upgraded" to this because we had to go up and down little sets of stairs with the cases. Anybody of a certain age may struggle with this. It has lots of dust on bedside lamps, and dirt inside the bedside table. One of the two cups used, was put back onto the tray, full of coffee stains. The toilet took between two to five pushes to flush and has cracked tile at the back of it. The TV is on such an angle, that it can only be viewed from certain parts of the room , needs to be on a swivel. Fantastic TV over the bath. No fridge in room. Not worth the price we paid for room only basis, over £220. The gym was fine, but the pool is tiny. There were a few people in when I went to swim, therefore, would have been a struggle to swim properly. Fine for a play about with the kids. Tired and dated hotel, even though we could smell fresh paint. Certainly would only give this a three star rating. Fire alarms went off at nine this morning too, no apologies for being woken up by this. Would rather stay in a b&b if in the area again. Bar was limited for shorts, no coke or Pepsi in bottles either. I did mention these points to staff, at different times, but don't think they seemed too concerned.

Three people altogether. Starters were nice. Main meals - I ordered rib eye steak, my son and partner ordered chateaubriand (I think that was £52 if i remember correctly, the cost , however is not the issue). My steak was lukewarm and two thirds of it, FAT! The chateaubriand consisted of 7 small slices of over cooked meat. I eat around the lukewarm fat, did not complain, just eat the meat that I could and filled myself up with the chips. When asked by the waiter if all was ok, I politely explained that mine was inedible. He sent the manager over, who then took my steak to the kitchen for close perusal under bright lights, presumably to check that i was not lying, unbelievable! He agreed that this was, in fact, all fat and extremely unusual - what about being lukewarm - see other reviews. He said nothing about the overcooked chateaubriand, but said he would discount the bill for mine. We then had deserts, ok, but nothing special. The bill came, over £175, even with the discounted steak. We had one bottle of cheap wine, 3 beers and 2 halfs of shandy. On perusal of bill, we realised that we had been charged for two bottles of beer from next table and £17 service charge! Not chargeable for only three diners. Was offered a free drink at the bar for our totally spoiled evening, which we declined. Totally ruined birthday. Went here on recommendation, never again!
