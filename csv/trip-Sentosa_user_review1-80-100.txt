It was my partners birthday during our stay so as requested they wrote happy birthday on the bed in petals (which I payed for) I then requested a birthday cake be put in the room on our arrival back, the request was granted but nothing turned up, slightly disappointing. As was mentioned to us power cuts are by no fault of the hotel, however, when you're sitting having a meal and the lights flick on and off 30-40 times it can get quite annoying. We abandoned our main meal due to this and when we told the resteraunt staff we were going back to the room due to the power cutting out they responded by saying "ok well the power is not our fault" When we mentioned this on check out they arranged a "very comfortable" taxi to the harbour for us...which was a tuk tuk shared with 2 other people

Honestly one of the best experiences we have ever had. Only made better by the truly amazing staff who work there and take care of the elephants. We did a lot of research before booking up as we know a lot of these places only claim to be sanctuaries and there's a lot of stuff that's hidden from you behind the scenes...not here. They all really love the elephants and see them more as family than animal. Our guide "M" or "Mickey Mouse" is hilarious, such a happy peaceful guy that made sure he was good friends with each of us before we left. They only ever have no more than 15 people in a group a day as it can intimidate the elephants and makes for a less intimate experience if there is anymore. I believe there were 12 in our group which was perfect. The elephants are beautiful and really look like they enjoy every bit of the day. Do yourself a favour, get booked up and get stuck in...you definitely won't regret it! If you read this M, thank you for such a lovely day! XAimee and Jordan

We used the hotel bikes a lot (free to use) Bed was comfy and staff very friendly. Main issue was the smell of the bathroom, there was a strong smell of sewage whenever you turned the tap or shower on which wasn't at all pleasant. Also I don't think our towels were changed while we were there, just folded and put at the end of the bed again.

Rooms are spacious and bathroom is nice, water runs from hot to cold a bit but we've found that with most places in Thailand. Staff are very friendly and helpful. On our last stay we missed a night due to a bus cancellation and they were kind enough to take it off the bill for us. Haven't tried the pool but it looks lovely! Don't expect a lie in as it can get a little noisy outside the room, we didn't go there to sleep all day though so wasn't a problem for us at all. Foods delicious!

You could tell the room would of been fab back in the day but there's clearly just been no up keep for a while. Free wifi in the room isn't true as ours could never connect. When we contacted the front desk for help on the matter she said she would send someone up to check it out but nobody came. A bit of a shame since we had wanted to plan and book the rest of our trip while we were there. Staff friendly upon arrival but didn't fancy staying for food.

The only niggle we have is that when we arrived we were told they had automatically upgraded our oasis suite to the one higher, we were obviously over the moon but once we got to the room we realised it wasn't much of a upgrade at all, the room was very dark, nothing like the one we had originally booked which was very spacious with big floor to ceiling windows and a bath that overlooked the city. Once I had informed the staff we would prefer the room we originally booked we then had to wait 2 and a half hours to be allowed in it. Apart from that the pool was lovely and the staff who worked around the pool were amazing, so attentive and friendly. Also the room we got in the end was beautiful! Breakfast buffet was fab with all sorts of options. Would really recommend for a little glamour above the streets of Bangkok!

Cocktails were fab, and the staff were very polite. Will be sure to return again if we come back to Copenhagen.

Size of room is enough to lay down your luggage on the floor. I never see smaler tv in hotel room, pillow was terible. Nothing special in the room but everything is woking and room was clean.Regarding location, you are in the centar of the city and soon as you step out from hotel you realize that here is epicentar of all happening in the city. Just near the hotel, there was many sexy dressed girls on the street, waiting probably for customers. All kind of restorants, bars etc. are nearby the hotel. If you like to visit chatolic church, you can do it as it is only 12 minutes walking from hotel. Hotel staff on reception speak good english and they are all very pleasant.

Gym is small and pool is closing at 19:00 so there is no night swimming.

It is kids friendly with a kiddies pool and play area. The breakfast is very good and have a good variety. When the hotel is full I would recommend to get breakfast before 8 in the morning. The service around the pool area is very slow. We stayed over n long weekend and check in took extremely long because there is not enough staff. The hotel was renovated recently and is beautiful.

We realy enjoyed the slides and the Valley of waves. Our 18 month old boy had the best day of his life at adventure mountain. There is lots to do for everyone. Unfortunately it was extremely overcrowded. It is impossible to get food inside the valley of waves due to all the people. Drinks are easier to get. It is about R15 for a 500ml coke. A hot dog is about R40. Best is to be there when the park open. Do the slides as early as possible before it gets busy.

I ordered the eggs benedict and ask for very soft eggs. I received my food and the eggs were hard, the plate had a lot!! Of spinach and just one small piece of bread. The bread was not even toasted. The bacon were half soft half extremely hard. Very weird. When the waiter ask me how it was, I told him and he just said he told them (kitchen) I wanted soft eggs. No apology and he dis not even ask if he can bring new eggs. For breakfast priced between R69 and R79 this is a rip off. We will nog visit them again. The coffee was very good.

The hotel is beautiful! The weather was great and could swim and enjoy the beach every day. Our room had a view of the quiet pool and we would recommend staying there. The main swimming pool is very large and even though the hotel had a high occupancy we could always find a beach chair and the swimming pool had more than enough space for everyone. The hotel is very child friendly. The beach is fantastic, long, white sands and very pretty. I would recommend taking the all-inclusive because food and drinks are very expensive. We ate at the buffet restaurant as well as Tides and the Italian restaurant. Our favorate was the Italian restaurant. Important: Book your place for the Italian and Tides restaurant before going to the hotel. We could not get a booking for our first 2 nights there.

For the drinks there are more than enough cocktails, beers, soft drinks, wines and juices included. The beach is amazing. It in a long, white sandy beach and you can take long walks. We would recommend this hotel for anyone and would like to go back one day.

She was not polite at all. I ordered "Milk Tea" which was mentioned on the menu board. I repeated the ordered multiple times but she didn't understand it and passed some comments in her language to her colleague. I had to show the menu to make her understand what I meant. She then pointed rudely to the tea bags and asked which one I want. I had to select English Breakfast Tea which I clearly didn't want. She also claimed that the brownie cake in the ice cream would be hot whereas it was not.Message to Cafe Kantary Management:I felt I was treated like that because of my color. Sorry if I'm rude in making my statements but I'm just expressing how I felt . I loved my stay at Kantary Bay Hotel which was beyond my expectations. Even if I visit the hotel in the future, I'd never visit the Cafe Kantary in Cape Panwa again.Hope this helps. Thanks.

She could have easily told me it was sea view but she didn't. On another occasion, staff highlighted to me (via email before check-in) that airport transfer is cheaper with normal taxi. Need I say more about their honesty.Suggestions:Avoid booking tourist services with the hotel as it's costly and they're not open for negotiations. Check out the tour services just outside the hotel. Bargain as much as you can.Take taxi outside hotel instead of the hotel taxi as normal taxi is cheaper. Airport transfer with normal taxi was 900 Thai baht whereas 1200 with the hotel. Try the different varieties of omlette at breakfast - it's custom made as per your need.Message to Kantary Bay Hotel:Our Phuket tour experience was elevated by your great service. Thanks a ton and hope to visit again.Hope this helps. Thanks.

As soon as we arrived at the airport the whole experience was a pleasure, the customer service was outstanding and nothing was a bother, there were a few times however when we utilised our vouchers from LE that the cost of the voucher item was on the invoice at the end of our meals, this was slightly frustrating as it happened a few times, although this was quickly rectified when pointed out. the room in this Suite we gave a 10 out of 10, which I never give, what you see in previous reviews and the photos that are available are correct, we were shocked at the space and facilities within. The food at the resort: Buffet breakfast was part of the deal and although good quality was a bit repetitive and a little hit and miss, although would still mark this at 6 out of 10, the main meals that we had, I thought were just in the ok bracket and would suggest that eating outside of the resort was a better option for us,especially the buffet dinner, which we did not enjoy. I would give the meals a 5 out of 10 and value for money the same. Overall I would give the resort an 8 out of 10 basically for the excellent customer service, Unfortunatly I have compared this resort with the Padmar which we stayed at over a year ago, overall I would recommend a stay here, better still if you can get a value package through Escape travel you will be on a winner, thanks crew for your excellent service

Aquarium|4| “Worth the visit”|review_475400469|Well worth the exercise, I have seen a few other posts comparing this with Melbourne aquarium, yes I agree that Melbourne is better, however not to far behind, we have been to various aquariums on our travels and rate this up there, the only real negative was the cleanliness of the toilets.
Melb0urne13|01735D6AF52F93FD78FDCB230C4FAF1D|Hotel|Singapore: Bay Hotel Singapore|3| “Basic”|review_475399892|Stayed here for six nights whilst travelling back from Bali to Melbourne, as soon as we hit reception the staff were un helpful and basically arrogant, being exhausted after our long day we were not given any information about the hotel, especially when I could not work out that you needed a swipe card to activate your floor on the lift (if we weren't so tired we would have worked it out fairly easily). I wont go on about the size of the room as we knew what we were getting with the deluxe size and previous reviews have been well documented around this, yes ant the re stocking of the mini bar is a bonus. We were situated on the 10th floor and had a great view, some traffic noise and noise from other rooms, again this is expected and not a fault with the hotel. The buffet breakfast that was part of our deal was hit and miss, although would score this a 4 out of 10 this score for the lack of variety and food not being regularly being turned over, better off going over to the plaza (Harbour Front not Vivo) for a reasonable priced breakfast ( big tip, Singapore is expensive). Overall good place for a stay over, although their customer service people need to take a leaf out of the Balinese book on customer service in hotels and resorts. One positive that does come to mind and that was the lady cleaner that was more than helpful during our stay, the male cleaner that we came across was totally rude. Rating for us overall is a 3 out of 10.
Melb0urne13|01735D6AF52F93FD78FDCB230C4FAF1D|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|3| “Worth the experience”|review_472382233|Spent the day at Universal and was put off straight away once we entered and went to go on the first ride, the guy at the entrance indicated that unsecured items should be put into lockers that were provided (which is fair enough), however every locker we went to store our goods were sold out, we then had to find someone that represented the park to give us direction (good luck with that), we eventually found two gents who were more than happy to help, they suggested to go back out and use the lockers situated just outside of the entrance, we found the lockers, then had trouble with inserting cash (again no one around to assist), eventually had success on the last go, with all this we had missed an hour and a half, not to mention lining up at the que to get in again, by the way it costs 15 dollars for a small locker outside of the park opposed to 20 dollars max inside of the park. After the initial frustrating moments we went on the first ride (battle star Galactica) which took nearly 2 hours to get through, I did put this down to the lack of organisation when we eventually reached the ride, there was way too much delay in getting people off and on (the rest of the rides were super organised), I understand the safety component, however this was due, in my opinion, poor team work (besides the ride was average). after this ride we went nearly all the major rides (I think a few people have mentioned after lunch), which did not take over 30 minutes to get on (transformers 15 mins after lunch), and found the organisation between these teams excellent. We have been to Universal in LA,Knotsberry Farm in Anaheim, Movie world and Dreamword, in Queensland, although you can not compare these to Singapore (which is overall expensive), although comparing prices for entry and food, fairly much the same across the board. As we were first timers here, I would suggest cater for the whole day here and don't forget to get your tickets from the MRT for 4 dollars each return, this is situated on the third floor of the Vivo centre. Best attraction for us was Transformers.

The staff made us very welcome from start to finish, the main thing that impressed my wife that the menu was / is Italian., especially the young waitress speaking Italian, not being a lover of pizza, I have too admit this place is great

The restaurants at the resorts are very good, however not many people go to them as they would rather go into Patong, we found the prices to be reasonable, you can not compare this to an equivalent to restaurants in Melbourne or Sydney. We found the beach out the rear of the resort a good place to relax (I have written a review earlier). The only criticism that I do have is that we came back to our room after being out and as soon as we walked into the room my son fell over due to a fault with the air conditioning leaking water, I had initially reported this verbally to resort management as well as in writing and email when I returned home, still no response. we did not let this wreck our stay and would stay again if the opportunity arises. At the time the resort was going through a restructure, however found most of the staff accommodating.

Seats were comfortable, although as my wife is tall, not a great deal of leg room. We would fly Garuda anytime, cost slightly more than Virgin and Jetstar, although value for money, will make a comparison in June when we fly out to Phuket on Thai airways.

Buffet breakfast is unbeatable and evening meals excellent, yes you can get cheaper meals outside of the resort, however the resort is still good value for money. Found the staff to be very helpful and friendly, would visit again, although not keen on revisiting Bali itself due to constant hassles from sellers on the street.

We had buffet breakfast for the two mornings we stayed, although twenty four dollars per person it was a bit pricey, however there are a couple of macas around the area. We found on checking out that they were very efficient and helpful, this was not the case on checking in as the guy was a bit non interested, (could have been a slow day) I will be defiantly staying at this location again.

Did not eat in the village as this was way to expensive, also hired a car outside of the village for half the price ( for us from AUS make sure they include insurance, slightly different system to ours). All over found Hawaii a bit expensive, although if you do your homework you can get some cheap deals (did I mention Ross stores), found the outlets at Waikele a bit of a waste of time. Pearl Harbour was good, and driving around at our own pace was the way to go. also, not that we went, found the beach area with ample space, overall if you go with an open mind that this is a tourist destination and is a little more expensive to the mainland USA you will enjoy your stay.

We found the hotel very good for price, considering that you are out most of the days, we were thrilled that at at the end of closing at Disneyland that you could see the fireworks show every night. If you want a room with a mirrowave this will cost you extra, however with the food chains along the main street, you would not really need to eat in the hotel room, although there are some great delivery options. We stayed for 10 nights (probably too long for this area, first time overseas), make sure you have a meal at the cheese cake factory. All in all would recommend this hotel, there is also plenty of cheap clothes shopping in the area (ross, guess etc), I would suggest using the local bus service which is good. One other word of advice, work out your tipping correctly and pay what you think, as this can be a little uncomfortable for the first time. Now looking at Fiji in April 2012, any suggestions (two older children and two adults).

Nice welcome from the hostess who for the rest of the evening appeared to be superfluous as she never came by to see how we were doing. Pleasantly surprised that there is a smoking area in the bar; much nicer than having to stand in the street. Unfortunately our server seemed to be poorly trained and was not able to work efficiently.

Spectacular views of the sea and the Islands!2. Cool winds at the hill stop3. Enjoying a cable rideThere have been many reviews on how to reach there and come back. It was super easy.

From Ambong Ambong we went there for RM 34 (30 - 40 mins) and there are plenty of taxis there at Cable Car where we got back in RM 32. The rates are fixed usually. You don't have to go for meter.

There are lots of good restaurants nearby so you don't have to worry about eating and shopping !10. The beach is at 6-8 mins walk. However the hotel driver can pick & drop so it is like 2 mins :)11. The hotel staff also guided us for tours and made bookings for us !12. Overall it was very peaceful and wonderful. I was planning to go to Andaman Luxury Hotel but because it was far away I chose Ambong Ambong and I am so glad I changed the plan. Next time I come to Langkawi it is surely Ambong Ambong again !!!Just one con of the hotel , even though the breakfast was hot and delicious , it was limited to one egg dish per person !

The same attractions that are there year after year. Universal might consider changing out some of the rids and attractions with something new. With all of that said. It's still definitely worth going if you find yourself in Singapore with kids. If you can afford to spend a little more, the express pass is worth it.

The park is a little smallish and they don't have any really big, scary rides but the place was well maintained and employees were friendly. The lazy river was really good passing through an aquarium, past dolphins ant through a very cool cave. If in Singapore with kids, I would recommend Adventure Cove.

We ordered oysters which were dry and tasteless. Crackers were stale and they didn't have any horse radish so oysters were served with catchup. We ordered the snow crab legs for our meal which weren't good at all. Service was good but it didn't out weigh the nasty food. Won't be back. Next year we will go to Jack in the Box for Christmas.

It was important for the kids to see the darker side of history Our 7 year old son was disturbed at the slavery and how people were treated. In a twisted way this made me proud because of the compassion he felt for the slaves. The history of the family was tragic as well and the tour guides did a great job of sharing those stories.The Plantation it's self is beautiful and definitely worth a visit.

The place was very nice and felt much roomier than most Perth Restaurants but it was very hot. There was only other table with people at it and for some reason they tried to sit us right next to them. I asked to sit wher there was a little more space and they gave us another table with no problem. Our waitress was sick and sniffling which I really didn't like but other than that, service was excellent.Our food was great and there was plenty of it but for some reason at 5:30 and only two tables of customers, they cranked up some bad music to the point of making it uncomfortable. I will go back because the place has great potential and the food and service were good.

Went inside and the place only had a few people in it yet every table was nasty. We decided to grab takeaway because the place was so disgusting. Went to order from the very all over the place menu. For some reason they want you to order strange combo meals but make it difficult to just order chicken with a side item.The owner of this store obviously doesn't care much about this store so we won't be going back.

They were so hard and dried out that I couldn't bite through them. The wrapping was literally hard. After wandering to myself how long those things had to sit out t become that hard, I just threw them in the bin.

To me it just seems like another overpriced park.What they did do a good job of was messing up traffic on Riverside Dr which at one time was the only good way to get through the CBD.

We had burgers but after ordering we saw a waiter walk by with a couple orders of ribs my wife and I both looked at each other thinking those looked good and wishing we had ordered them instead of the burgers.When the burgers came they turned out to be very good. Much better than Grilled, Jus Burger and the other burger chains.I thought the service was pretty good considering how busy it was. The only down side was how busy this place was. It was 40 minutes from the time we walked up until we got our food. This was on a Saturday for lunch.

When our waitress took our drink orders she told us that they were running slow and it would be 30-40 minutes to get food. We appreciated the heads up and the wait was no problem for us. Food was good but could have been better. We had Chicken lettuce wraps which were delicious, the Original BBQ Chicken pizza had almost no sauce making it very dry. The jambalaya fettuccine was really good but the sausage was nowhere close to Andouille and was not good. The kiddo had the kids Hawaiian pizza and it was very good.The atmosphere was good, tables were big enough and we didn't feel crammed in like most Perth restaurants. We are going to give it a couple of months to let the new wear off and try again.

Stopped by the theater toilets on the way in and I can only describe them as third world. Nasty, dirty, seats ripped from toilets etc. The area outside of the theaters was really nasty with rubbish and popcorn all over the place. The gold class experience was pretty bad as well. We stood at the door to gold class for several minutes before someone came over to scan out tickets.The food was OK but I found it very strange that if I ordered certain combos, I could get onion rings with them but I couldn't buy onion rings.

Its beautifully kept and has a great variety of animals in natural, roomy enclosures. The polar bear is just awesome. You can watch him swim and play from above or below water.The kids water park is awesome so if you go, bring swimming clothes for the kids. My son spent four hours in the water.If in Singapore, the zoo is definitely worth a look.

Flavour of the meat is nothing like any Mexican food that I grew up on (yes I grew up eating Mexican food every day). The cheese is completely wrong and nasty. I struggle to understand why no one has opened a real Mexican food place in Perth. They would make heaps of money because everything else is terrible including Mad Max.

For some reason it is so much better than any Chili's in the US or any other country that I have eaten at. Even if you don't like Chili's, This one is definitely worth a try.

The waiter kept correcting me on the pronunciation of "tortilla" which was pretty funny because I'm from Texas and he almost insisted that I pronounce the L's. Then for some reason they almost refused to sell me extra tortillas. We waited for a very long time to order, then had to wait a very ling time for our food. We ordered guacamole two times to eat with our chips before our meals. It finally came after our food.The food was decent but they should really do some training for their wait staff.

The water park was closed for winter but there was still plenty to keep the kids entertained. The place was very well kept, food tasted like someone actually cared (you can bring your own picnic) and the anamals seemed to be well cared for. A lot of the birds would come right to you (in their cages) and say "hello". I would recommend this place for families with kids.

The flight was a comfortable as possible with friendly service. The connection at LAX was terrible. We walked from the international terminal to terminal 7. There is a shuttle available but after sitting for 14 hours we opted for the walk. United's terminal 7 is old, dirty and very crowded. United should be embarrassed about the condition of their lounge at LAX. One of the lounge staff yelled at my 6yo son because he was curled up in a chair sleeping (after 22 hours of travel) and his feet were on it. We left the lounge and notified the United staff at the desk of the incident but they seemed to not really care. The flight from LAX to IAH was late departing. It amazed me that it took almost an hour to cater the plane causing the late departure. This was a 787 and the flight crew was friendly and helpful.United's international business is good but I would avoid LAX. The International arrivals terminal, immigration and customs are all really nice and efficient but what United offers at LAX is old, dirty and run down with rude employees.

No respect for environment (it is a beautiful land and they just overbuild without keeping any nature and with no distance between villas5. Sound system and projector not working 6. Showers have no door but they give you a tool to swipe away the overflowing water :) as in the picture 7. Construction work sound as they are building more villas around Important note: in December and January in this island starts the rainy season, be carful as you will be paying for high season while in reality it is the worst possible period to visit the island.I have informed the villa management about the disappointing experience and they just answered sorry we will take it in consideration - that's all.

It was a spacious one with a private sit out. The view from the room is brilliant. As soon as you are ready to check-in, the welcome drink that is served is delicious. My package had dinner also included. One on of the days, I couldn't dine at the restaurant for dinner and they gladly sent dinner over to the room. They went out of their way to entertain my toddler. The pick-up, which was again included in my package was smooth and they driver was courteous. Will definitely like to visit again.The only disadvantage about this property is not having an indoor heated pool, which would have been fantastic during winters.

First of all, the day we went, it was super hot (Not the zoo's fault). The animals were also tired and looked lazy. The pandas were sleeping. There is no point taking the kids in stroller, since they need to be lifted to see the animals. You can visit only if you want to see pandas. Otherwise one can miss the zoo.

I booked the tour online. The guide was very informative and showed us the city highlights, while we were passing through. They take you to 4 wineries, with a lunch included at Peter Leighman. You are also given time to explore the market region. Overall we had good fun.Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to do a wine tour.
PriyaSuri|12FEADA22B9312B020C725B1B524431F|Hotel|Adelaide: iStay Precinct|3| “Good Value”|review_261587595|I got a great deal from makemytrip.com and booked a 2 bedroom apartment for 4 nights in February 2015. The deal that I got was only room and no housekeeping, but the deal was so tempting that I didn't bother about the house keeping. We reached the apartment early by about 10:00 am and did offer us an apartment, since we had a 2 year old with us. The apartment is of decent size and there was a balcony as well. The living room and one bedroom had air-conditioning, while the second bedroom did not. So it was stuffy for people staying in that room. The kitchen is of good size and had utensils necessary for 4 people. The tram station, malls, adelaide central market, etc are all close by. Location wise, it was fantastic. The staff did their best to help us. On Feb 15th, my son was tired and wanted to rest. So I decided to come back to the apartment and watch the India-Pakistan match. The set-top box wasn't working and they couldn't do anything about it. So it was quite frustrating to come back from the stadium and not being able to watch the match. Wifi is free for 30 minutes (continuously used), otherwise one has to pay for it.Overall, it was a good stay and can check out my whole Aussie experience at http://myconnectionwithfood.blogspot.in/search/label/Australia

The variety of food served was brilliant. The service was very good. The breads were served hot. The hotel gave us complete value for money. If you are looking for a complete veg restaurant, one should look no further. The best part about the meal was the complimentary cake that was given. The butterscotch flavour was just super yummy that we were craving for more. A big thank you to Chef Yeshwant, who dished out brilliant food.

The road leading to the hotel is so bad that I was doubting my decision about booking this property. But once you reach, it looks very nice. The hotel staff is friendly. The luxury deluxe room that we booked was very nice. The rooms are very big. The breakfast spread is good and the pool was fantastic. Did not dine out at any of the restaurant. The taxis available at the hotel is expensive and we rented one at baga beach. All the beaches are 5-10 minutes away. If you are ok about not wanting to be on the beach, then this resort fits the bill perfectlyMore about this resort on http://myconnectionwithfood.blogspot.in/search/label/Resort%20Rio

We didn't book the transfer option from hotel as it seemed expensive for the price they quoted. We took the cab from airport and it was a 20-30 minute drive. Since we reached early, we decided to have our lunch before they could allot a room. We booked the Superior Charm room with a sea view. Good value for money. They ended up giving us complimentary breakfast, surprise room decor on our anniversary, complimentary starter and many more. The service was outstanding. The staff go out of their way to make you happy. The spa was brilliant. The beach is a bit of walk but you have the option of calling the buggy. The food at Jasmine Bay was ok but the food at Curries and Bait were brilliant.Overall an amazing stay. I would like to thank Mr. Ghanshyam, Mr. Nobel, and Mr. Subin for the amazing service.

We booked 2 double occupancy and 1 triple occupancy room. The check-in process for deluxe room is quite long. We reached the hotel early, but this place is massive that one can while away the time easily. Unlimited access to Aquaventure and Lost Chamber is provided to all guests who stay at Atlantis. Aquaventure was so much fun. We experienced shark snorkelling while we were there and it's a thrilling experience to be snorkelling with so many sharks!! We dined at Ronda Locatelli for dinner and it was absolutely lip smacking. This is a must visit place for families with kids. Overall a great place to stay.

The apartment was spacious and it was absolutely worth the money that we paid. The only hitch was the service at breakfast place was lousy. Most of the time, we ended up not eating there. The pool on top was brilliant and it was quite easily accessible as well. It made more sense to not book cab service from airport through the hotel. They do charge a bomb. Instead, there are many cabs at the airport and it's cheaper to travel in one of them. Would definitely head back and hope they come up with a better breakfast corner.

We were initially upgraded to Sunset water villa. On the day we checked in, the AC in our room was not functioning properly. The next day, we were were upgraded to a one-bedroom suite. The room was gorgeous and one could see both sunrise and sunset from the room. The food was fabulous and not to mention the service of Four Seasons never seems to disappoint. The staff went out of their way to help me with my infant. We celebrated my mother-in-law's birthday there and she was surprised with personalized gifts from each department. My husband felt the snorkelling was okay, when compared to the experience he had at Bora Bora. The best part about my stay was the spa. Absolutely brilliant.

I was debating between Kumarakom and this place, before I finally narrowed down to this place. I chose the 3 night package of Estate pool villa, which included all 3 meals for both of us. The resort had arranged a car to pick us up from Birur station. It was a bit of bumpy 1.5 hr drive. As soon as you check in to the resort, you are offered a yummy cold coffee. Luckily, we were given the resort near to the entrance, so we didn't have to walk much. The villa was huge, with a big bedroom and bathroom. We did have our own private pool in the room, but didn't really swim as the weather was pretty cold. I was not a big fan on the food served here but they do have a wide variety. I enjoyed my breakfast here the most. I did indulge in spa, which was again nice. The service of this resort is very nice.The resort arranged for us to travel to Mullayanagiri hills, which is the highest peak in Karnataka. The view from both this hill and the resort is a treat to the eyes.Will definitely love to get back to this place.

It was a long travel from Delhi to Jaipur because of some construction. I was dead tired by the time we reached Jaipur. We were greeted with a garland and welcome drink. The room was way down and a pretty long walk from the reception. The room was absolutely elegant. It was very well decorated and the room was spacious.The buffet breakfast was fab. I just wish I could have stayed longed at this hotel. While we were checking out, there was a car rally and it was wonderful to see the rally.Will definitely visit this hotel again

The only hitch was it was very difficult to book one, since they kept saying it's not available and finally they did offer one to us :)It was the best room we could possibly book. The villa was beautifully decorated. We had a living room with dining area, a private pool in the room, an extremely comfortable bedroom, open shower area with a private jacuzzi.. I can just go on about the room and it was just splendid. This villa is the most expensive one out there but worth the money one pays.The service was absolutely wonderful. The swimming pool is one of the best I've seen. But I never got to experience it since I has a swimming pool in my room. The food is delicious. Having your dinner by the sea - absolutely romantic. I stayed here for 2 nights and can't wait to get there againThis place is the best romantic getaway in Chennai. I keep going there for dinner and this is one of my favourite place out here :)

I googled a lot about this place and read reviews on TA before narrowing it down to Four Seasons. I was not disappointment one bit. This was the first time I was staying at Four Seasons and I was super excited. I had booked "Short Package" for 4 nights, which included both breakfast and lunch. At the airport, Four Seasons staff greeted us with water, garland, cold towel and this amazing boat to take us to the resort. We checked into our Beach View OWB. The room was just absolutely brilliant and the view was just amazing.. This one was just close to paradise.The staff were very helpful and always smiling. The hospitality surpassed that of any other hotel I have been to. They arranged for us to go for Scuba Diving, Snorkeling and various other activities. The itinerary comes to your room for your confirmation the previous day .The food is good. I thought there would be some difficulty, since I'm a vegeterian. But there was a separate vegetarian menu. The spa here is the BEST... I just can't stop raving about Bora Bora and about this property. I had to travel 35 hours to reach Bora Bora and I wouldn't mind going all over again to stay at this place :)

We were greeted with a garland, juice and cold towel. The hotel looks good and the swimming pool is just awesome. Both the rooms we got were close to the beach and beach facing rooms. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly at the swimming pool and beach. The buffet was just great, both breakfast and dinner. The room was quite old but the service was just awesome.On one night, they charged full price for the kid in my sister-in-law's family. They apologized profusely and gave us the next dinner free for the entire family!!!

From a distance, this hotel looks like "OMG!!! Did I travel all the way for this?" but once you enter, its all worth it. I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with my husband and my sister-in-law's family. The decor of this hotel was very nice, with the left and the huge generator. As soon as you enter, they greet you with Cold towel, tea and herbs. We went to our room and it was nice. The bathroom was spacious. We had a sit out balcony in our room and the view was just fantastic. The spa was closed very early on the day we arrived and I didn't bother to check out the next day. It was closed by 5 pm!!! They is a small golf area to play and they provided cards and monopoly to play in the room. They had a small play area for kids.The breakfast buffet was nothing great. We then proceeded for our bird watching at 10:00 am. The walk was beautiful but we could not see any birds. You happen to see them only at the 6:30 am walk. The guide was very patient and the walk ended by visiting the garden in the hotel.The only thing we missed during our stay was dining at the railway carriage restaurant. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely stay here if I happen to go to Nuwara Eliya again.

Mid-way we visited the elephant orphanage. By the time we reached the hotel, we were tired because of the heat and the road to hotel. We reached in the evening and we were greeted by a smiling lady. I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with my husband and my sister-in-law's family. Both our rooms were next door and the view from our rooms were very nice. Since they were a family of 4, they upgraded them to a bigger room, which has a lounge area apart from the bedroom. The french window opens to a nice view and the morning coffee is just a bliss out here. The swimming pool was nice. We played table tennis, but it was right next to the swimming pool!!!! When you travel up the hill in the night, you can view the hotel and it looks very nice. The breakfast buffet was good. Overall it was a pretty good stay.

The hotel lobby is huge and the security guard greets you with a huge smile. There were too many weddings taking place. The rooms were spacious and nice. I really liked the bright and cute colored bottles in the bathroom and the whole decor was nice. The swimming pool looked ok but the best part was it was near to be the beach.We went to a restaurant named"Chutneys" in the hotel for dinner. The experience was nothing great. The food was average. We didn't book before going to the restaurant, so they were pretty stubborn about the seating. There was a six seater table in the center of the restaurant, which was not reserved so far. They were adamant that they seat us next to the entrance of the restaurant (another 6 seater), since the one at center had a baby chair. I couldn't understand why they could not move that baby chair to another table!!! Also the food served was very cold. Overall it was a good experience at the hotel and we enjoyed our stay here. The next time I might want to stay somewhere else just to compare my stay.

Both the time got the table next to the sea exactly the seat shown in their display. The scenic beauty, sound of the sea, the passing by boat, the live music at the restaurant, the hospitality of the staff all made the place perfect. One small tip is to be very clear with the staff about your food tastes so that they help you out with your perfect food for the evening. Lasagne that we ordered tasted just yumm.

A clean and well maintained place. One thing to definitely not miss would be Steven Spielberg Lights Camera Action section where they show you a glimpse of sound and special effects. All the other rides are good. Though the rates are on a little higher side but worth it. Please reach the venue on time so that you can cover the entire thing in a day.

To count services they have gym, laundry, free breakfast, free wifi, hair dryer, room locker facility, and even a handy smart phone with local number. The handy smartphone is a super facility for any tourist who does not want to buy a SIM card and can also save on international roaming charges.

Teenz888|D32D9CE8C2B97C0AD112EA8C7CBD38B4|Hotel|Imerovigli: Azul Hotel|5| “The perfect start to our cross-continental Honeymoon Treck”|review_479945142|We weren't too sure about this hotel as picture on bookings.com can sometimes be misleading. But it definitely lived up to expectations. If your looking for pure luxury Villa or a Happening Hostel, then Azul is not for you. Azul is a pleasantly quaint and humble accommodation that has well kept standard rooms but boast a stunning view of santorini. Based in IMEROVIGLI it is slightly elevated from Fira and gives a stunning view of the Caldera. The hotel has kept to the iconic all white Santorini theme and has three levels of accommodation to offer. Pay the extra for the view. Whatever it is. Just remember that this is why you came to Santorini, to be immersed in its landscape. This hotel is priced very reasonablely (we paid AUD$80 a night in April 2017) and worth having your own personal balcony to stare at those cliff faces all day everyday. The Room (3) is clean, and we'll kept. Not very big but not very small. I liked that the bed was firm and the pillows were fluffy. The bathroom is very tight but hopefully this should be an issue as you should be spending more time on your balcony then in the bathroom. The extras: towels good quality, travel accessories good, no kettle or in-room tea or coffee ( but ask the reception and they will make one up for you.) but has a small fridge to keep your water cold. Staff are fabulous and are the best part of this hotel. Sergios is funny and gives great recommendations and tips. For example, he told us to make sure we enjoy the scenic 20 minutes stroll down to Fira....but then catch the bus back up. We saw so many people do it the other way round and they looked like they were in pain. A simple tip that made our trip that much more enjoyable. Leonidas also was very obliging and greeted us at 12.30am to show us to our rooms as well as allow us to stay in the court yard while we wait for our transfers. If you contact them via email, don't be worried if they haven't replied straight a way, it takes a little time but once they do its very helpful. outstanding customer service with fantastic staff.Breakfast is amazing and it was delicious every moring. Get the breakfast it goes with the view. Weak WiFi in the room, No pool and our window was starting to break but again these problems are forgotten when your there enjoying the stunning views. Don't sweat the small stuff, if you are lucky enough to be in Santorini, try to adopt the casual island life and attitude. You will enjoy it better. We would recommend this Hotel to anyone and everyone. Love it!

They also offer a $3 shuttle straight to the domes if you have difficulties walking or if it's raining. if it's raining they will shut-down the skywalk also, acess to this is $8. If you can afford and are a plant enthusiastist, it worth getting it all. We went and the flower dome was having a tribute show to Van Gough and tulips. It was stunning. The Supertree shows are daily at 7.45 and 8.45. A must see if you there at that time.

This may be suited to for families with young kids looking to complete all the attractions of sentosa Island. You also receive a free drip brew coffee and a Merlion medallion as a keep sake. I gave mine away to a passing child. Although pretty to look at by day and by night (lit up in different colours) not really our thing.

To do this turn left once you get out of the ticketing validators.The location is not only convenient for the airport but also because many of the MRT lines transfer after either a stop or two after lavender. We were able to visit sentosa, gardens by the Bay, Clarke query, Chinatown, little india and Newton hawkers centre by MRT jumping. The hotel is surrounded by food outlets from local fold-out, MacDonalds, Burger King and a 7/11 across the road at the small shopping centre. The hotel also has a Cafe and a money changer if needed.Frances at front desk was really efficient and friendly. They allowed us to check in at 11am at no additional cost. We got a city view room and although the room was very small (compared to a standard in Australia) the view was beautiful and it was nice to sleep looking out at the lights. The bedding was good. Aircon very effective. Shower was very tight squeeze but did the job. Complimentary Slippers were good because the floor tiles was freezing.Only negative I can think of is that the stairwells smelt like cigarettes even though we were on a non-smoking floor.bI'd stay again due to the basic standard of room, convenience of location and accessibility of attractions.

Prices range from SD$4-10, a bit more for fresh crab and seafood. Beer and other alcoholic sodas are available here. You can even buy a carton of beer if you want. Just be sure to clean up after yourself. There are food tray trolleys scattered around for diners to place their dirty dishes on.

Its has lots of restaurants, food retail stores, fountains and the entrance to Universal Studios.Take good walking shoes if your planning to spend the day there. All the areas are paved and it has great disable access everywhere with elevators and escalators too. This is as touristy as it can get without it being Disneyland. Dont go here if you are wanting to experience the taste of "real" Singapore or if your on a diet. LOL. All the worlds top sweets stores are here from Krispy Kremes to Hersheys. If you have a sweet tooth that Festive Walk is Candyland for adults with money to burn :) Enjoy.

It is stunning visually that I had to restrain my self from viewing it through the lens of my camera. Experience it in all its spectacular dimensions. See how the lasers stream in infinite directions and how the water spouts and sprays in a ballet of rhythm. This attraction is under SD$20 and you get a free gift and snack. I wouldn't worry about getting the priority seating unless its peak tourist season or if your hell bent in getting a front row seat. Otherwise there are plenty of seats available with all the same view. If your not into media productions/visual arts....you wont enjoy this and may find it a waste of money but if you can appreciate the mastery, the timing and the algorithms in place to make this visual symphony come together than it is a must see,

The building is still very new and the Apartment was well appointed. Decor is modern but homely. Fridge is a decent size for longer stay guests. Balcony had an amazing view of the harbor and had Constantine doors that open up the balcony with the lounge room. Kitchenette was well equipped. Air conditioning was excellent. Location is not as central as other hotels but the walk is not to difficult mins from the city center. Undercover parking is very confusing and difficult to get around. Pool looks nice but didn't utilize it during our stay.

Have a look around at the souvenir shops and get dinner and queue in line for the first safari tour at 7:15. If you are able do the Trail walks. They allow you to get up and personal with some of the creatures. A great night for our group of 11 pax ages 19-35 years old.

Clean and helpful staff with great sets that will amaze you. Some tips for a great day:1. Start early when its less crowded.2. Buy a priority pass (SD$30.00) but it believe me its the difference between 5 mins and sometimes 50mis in a queue. This is a must during school holidays or weekends.3. Not much dining options mostly fried food. But you can get pass-outs to eat in Sentosa and then go back inside.4. Do the Jurrasic Ride as one of your last ones because you can get pretty wet (especially your shoes)5. Wear comfortable shoes.6. Do the Water World show , Check the times that its on and dont miss out.7. People will try to cut the line, just be assertive and polite in addressing this and if they succeed in forcing their way, don't let it ruin your day (but you shouldn't get this problem if you get a priority pass).

The interior is modern, clean and beautifully decorated.The Room: We stayed in a standard twin share and it was very well appointed and clean. King singles pushed quite close together. Bed was firm but very comfortable. Two pillow given (One Firm and One feather down). Adjustable air-conditioning and not central-ducted air condition. The little extras that I love are the light cotton robes and single use slippers in the wardrobe, the coffee pod machine, electronic blinds, the deep bath tub and the phone in the toilet (in case I got lonely? ;P). The small criticism, the mineral smell of the bath wash, the first set of towels were old (second lot were fluffy and new) and the noise and view of the construction site next to the hotel (not the hotels fault). The Facilities: Relaxing pool deck with sunbeds in the waters edge (very cool) not very deep so great for kids. Buffet Breakfast was amazing and had a great range of international options from croissants to congee . Our group being over 10 we were accommodated in a private fuction room to dine together. Gym was cosy but useful. The WOW (world of Whiskey bar) was impressive. In room dining is on the pricey side. We didnt dine here for dinner but opted to eat out in other outlets.The location: Le Merdien is across the road from the Imbiah Station (the free monorail that runs across sentosa from Siloso Beach to Vivo Shopping centre). Perfect for those that want five star accommodation near all the sights. The famous Merlion at your door step to greet you every morning. 7/11 2 mins walk. Casino 5 mins walk away. The Sentosa plaza has many shops and attractions in close proximity. The staff: Are very efficient, friendly, welcoming and accommodation to your request. Concierge booked our transport and ticketed sight seeing activities. Even lent out umbrellas when it rained.Would definitely stay here again as a couple, family or for business.

The grounds are well kept and quite large. The individual sites are fairly close but there is enough shrubbery to give some privacy if you need. We got a unpowered site for $30 and it as lovely. We would have liked to have a fire pit site bit they were not available when we arrived. The ground was a little hard to put our leash stake in so we had to tie our dog to the car tow bar. All the dogs were well behaved and no barking through the night.Very nice amenities with roomy showers and toilets. The kitchen was well equipped even if we didn't use it and I saw they even have a laundry, ice machine and gas refilling station. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay again, even try a cabin out.

We chose this because the camping grounds which were close by allowed pets. It's only a quick 5-10mins walk there. The springs has proper steps and hand rails to help you in your the water but it still is very natural so if you are not keen on algae and the smell of black mud, this might not be for you. The water is warm and the current is soft. If you decide to swim down to the second set of stairs bring your things with you so you don't have to walk over the rocks bare footed on the way back. Not very populated Springs.It's a nice spring but Mataranka is prettier from memory.

Booth table was good and I like how you can play board games while you wait. The I say, I say chicken burger and hey diddle diddle steak burger was nice. The chicken fillet look juicy and thick. The steak was super thin but at least it was a wide cut, the mushrooms helped with the taste and the texture making it seem more meaty. The third burger was the Dundee crocodile burger and it had a different flavour to the normal burgers around Darwin. The Mango chutney used really made it unique but unfortunately the croc meat itself was dry and over cooked.All chips were nice and the aioli was lovely. The portion size of the burger is bigger than average and Turkish bread is lovely. Menu items resemble a fancier trendier version of pub grub favourites with the prices reflecting the trendier side of things. The portion size makes up for it, making it better value for money.Staff were fine, service was efficient in doing the job, didn't make too much of an impression, but that's only a small criticism.Had some nice specials on display so I may be back if they have something more enticing than the regular run of the mill menu. Looking forward to seeing what else they have to offer.

I thought this quick little get away may inspire him to follow his dreams and also to add a little adventure into our normal weekend routine. I found HeliSpirit online and called their 1800 number. I spoke to a lovely lady Helen who was very helpful in taking me through the different tours available in Kathrine. We were also travelling with our dog and was concerned it might be an issue to leave him at the tour office while we were on the tour. Helen assured me that it would be fine as the office is just outside the National Park boundaries and fully fenced. I end up booking the 12minutes K1 tour for $125 each and thought that was really good value compared to other providers in Katherine. On arrival Steve the pilot and Zanthea were very friendly and accommodating. Steve even went out of his way to get our puppy a bowl of water to drink. The Helicopter was in well kept condition and it was a bonus that we could have the option to fly with the front doors off. Exhilarating! On telling Steve of my fiance aspirations to fly one day, Steve gave a very informative brief and tour of the mechanics of the plane, Helicopter capabilities and other interesting details. He was also very informative when it came to the geographical facts of Nitmiluk and the surrounding regions. Steve gave fascinating commentary and we felt very safe in his care. Obviously if our budget would have allowed it we would have chosen an option with more time in the air to view all the gorges however saying that, having done the 12 minute tour we did not at all feel disadvantage. It is definitely worth every cent and it feels like the time flies and slows down all at the same time.We enjoyed it that much that we are looking to see if we can do another HeliSpirit Tour in the Kimberley. I would recommend this for tourists and local Territorians alike. Whether it is for an efficient sightseeing mission, ticking an item of your bucket list or just injecting some fun and adventure into your life. We are definitely glad we have collected this memory. Thank you Steve and Zanthea and the rest of Team HeliSpirit.

But it is Darwin favourite and many locals come here because of the authentic Indonesian cuisine and generous servings. There little old ladies serve you and they may not be the most bubbliest but they are adorable. Just looking at them you know that their recipes are past down through the generations. Made with love and hard work.The dish options are served through a bainmarie and is quick and served hot. The dishes rarely change but it is this consistency that encourages you to keep coming back for more. They are never stingy on the serves or the ration of meat you get on your plate.A well kept secret for sure. yum.

Muffin was delicious, moist and balance in flavour and I am still dreaming about it now. The cream frosting was sensational, a little on the sweet side but that maybe because I don't really eat much sugar. SO GOOD. I MEAN SOOO GOOD.This first impression has enticed me to come back and try their breakfast and lunch.A little hard to find but great venue. Very large dining area and perfect for meetings and office lunch. I like the concrete modern industrial style of the venue and I was impressed with the hanging plants that soften the look until I saw they were fake. But that's a practical choice I suppose. Looking for a reason to go back with work crew. Great new option in Berrimah.

The smart decor, high ceilings and the sun drenched room with a beautiful view of the casino gardens. Staff were obliging and at tentative.

First with my friends, then for a work fundraiser and more recently on my date night with my fiance. On every occasion I have thoroughly enjoyed it. At first it may seem like any other small local restaurant/take away but the food is will leave an impression. Guaranteed. From opening the doors you are greeted by the hypnotic aromas that are wafting from the kitchen pass windows. The staff are friendly and smile as they greet you. The menu is extensive and the array of choices does not make it easy to pick or sway from your favourite. I love the dehydrated hand towel, not only is it a good ideas as culturally eating curry with your hands is normal but i love the theatrics involved when the waitress comes over to hydrate it. On all occasstion the food was served hot, fresh, full of flavour and in very generous servings. I personally found the goat curry slightly salty but that probably because I rarely cook with salt. My friends thought it was balance for their palates. The choices of different condiments other than the typical ones served around Darwin is a welcomed change as well as the gesture of complimentary poppadoms. This small gift makes such an impact. It automatically makes me feel valued as a guest, comfortable in my surroundings and also keeps my hunger at bay while simultaneously makes me excited in anticipation for my meals to come. Besides the food, other great benefits are that it is very reasonably priced, takeaway is available, BYO licence, clean new venue and good parking.It is fantastic to have this quality now available as a dining experience in Palmerston. Keep up the great work.

We thought we were close to the beach but unfortunately we had to taxi to the more trendier parts of seminyak. But we later find out that this was the case for most of the villas advertised at this price range. upon entering the drive way, our doubts disappeared and the reception staff were very friendly and helped us with our room. We booked a lower level room which meant we got a private garden courtyard (small but good if your a smoker and we didnt have to climb stairs (also great as we were sore from the Mt Batur Climb). Unfortunately the door was a bit stiff and was hard to close without having to really slam it and the lock was a little fiddly. The room was quite spacious with our own kitchenette but no appliances to cook with, apparently its for the chefs to cook on for breakfast. Room was tidy and well presented but dusty. Dust on the floor and benches and even on our pillows so perhaps it hadn't been stayed in for more than a week.Bathroom was nice and water pressure was good. Did not use the pool on this stay but it look lovely and cleanThe standout was the staff who accommodated all our requests and helped with local information and assisted us in booking tours and transfers to gili islands.All in all a very good stay and very good value for the money.

The first time we went for a dinner sitting and it was delicious, with an array of amazing foods and so many options for entree, main and dessert. The view of the night lights were pretty and it was fun to guess all the places we'd visited so far. This time we went for the lunch option because it was considerably cheaper and the view was just as pleasant during the day however the food was not as nice, smaller selection and not presented with the care it had been for the dinner sitting. It was also a lot more busier (but perhaps that was due to it being a public holiday). Staff were friendly and they allowed us to pay separately. Drinks and cocktails also delicious. Also great value considering that the price for the buffet also included access to the viewing deck (one level down) but honestly the view from Atmosphere 360 is better and with less people in your eye line.Would go back again but for dinner.

Very popular and it has a lovely outdoor area to sit at. I have never had a bad experience with food or drinks at the Deck bar. We saw the Food crate advertise on their Facebook and thought we'd check it out. It looked delicious and we were very impressed with the concept and presentation. We wanted to order the Stars & Stripes but make a few alterations to accommodate our friend that doesn't handle chili very well. Unfortunately when we asked the waitress if we could have the sauce on the wings on the side she told us we weren't able to as it is marinated in it. Even when we questioned her that the wings are battered first , according to the description, then tossed. She shrugged and said she was quoting the chef. Not sure what happened there.... But we decided to get it anyhow and our friend had to get a separate meal. While waiting we had some cocktails and a jug of sangria, however the same waitress, who I now presume is new, made it very nervously and unfortunately it showed in the end result as all three of our orders were very mediocre in taste and presentation. This is the first time that Deck bar staff have not lived up to the expectations of their reputation. Darwin knows Deck as having good Bar Tenders with great cocktails. I never got the poor waitress' name.The crate came out and looked fabulous but I was a little disappointed that the pulled pork was dry. Wings were very saucey and the Dressings was tasty. Although, I didn't understand how the corn chips fit in? I know they are very American but it seemed out of place on the crate. I also thought that it would have been nice to have a fresh or vegetable side dish to balance out all the protein and starch on the crate. A little bumpy but everyone has a bad day now and then. Overall, it was nice and we wanted to go there to try the Crates. It is such a great concept that perhaps needs a little tweeking and better execution. Perhaps I will try one of their other themed crates next time.

Especially when we are near a China town. Steamed Up has very tasty dumplings and very Nicely cooked pork buns. We are just used to paying southern prices for them. In Melbourne you can buy 30pc of dumplings for $13.00 and can easily get a belly full on a budget. We go out of our way to visit our favourite places when we go down south. Unfortunately there is not much competition in Darwin for Dumplings and hence the prices. We paid $16 for 12 pc. I'm not saying it's not worth it because they are delicious but it doesn't make me want to rearrange my schedule just to eat here again. We also had the Beef brisket which was amazing and well priced ($4.95) for the portion. Staff are polite and venues is clean and very new looking still. Overall a nice lunch :)
Teenz888|D32D9CE8C2B97C0AD112EA8C7CBD38B4|Restaurant|Darwin: Golden Orchid|4| “Breakfast Buffet”|review_351551783|My Fiance and I stumbled across this breakfast buffet because the cafe up the road, The Boatshed were to busy to acknowledge us at the seating counter. Golden Orchid is not your standard western buffet and my first impression is that the restaurant and food looks a little suspicious, tacky and is lacking a sense of identity. But for an eat all you can breakfast for $18 (price of a standard eggs benedict at these waterfront venues) we thought we'd give it a shot. We have been back 8 times since we discovered it and we have noticed more and more people are also "discovering" this little Darwin gem. Sure the decore is not the greatest but the air con is good inside and the view outside is lovely by the Marina. Initially I thought that their fare lacked identity but I have since began to love the various different options of breakfast I can have. I grew to love the fact that I could have fried rice with gyoza dumplings, scrambled eggs, pork steam bun and a croissant all on one plate. So many little options and also the make a pretty good flat white. Sure, I thought it was tacky but it is also charming. The staff are efficient and friendly and I can't find another venue in Darwin that makes a better international buffet (especially for that price) than the Golden Orchid.  If you do decide to go here, don't expect gourmet dishes that is in the caliber of homemade hollandaise sauces, but more simple Asian breakfast with added western options that you can pile on your plate and leave feeling very full. A good find and great option for a casual brekkie.

Not only did I book here tonight because of fantastic fare but because their service is always reliable and fast. Nicholas the manager with his team do a wonderful job in ensuring fast and friendly personalised service. We had a limited time before our event so unfortunately we could get our usual entrees but our waitress was prompt in attending to us. We were able to order our mains with a bottle of wine and we hadn't even been there for 10 mins yet. Our favourite is the Beef Pho and Chow is the only place we will order it at. However, tonight we thought we would be more adventurous and try something new. Lemongrass Chicken Stir Fry and Kang Kong with a side of steam rice. Sometimes it doesn't always pay off to deviate from the favourites but we definitely weren't disappointed. The meals came out beautifully hot and in abundance. The flavours were delicious although we were surprised that the stir fry lemongrass chicken was more of a curry dish, but delicious nonetheless. We really wanted to have a cocktail but unfortunately did have the time. At least it gives us another excuse to come back sooner than later. Can't wait to try something else on the menu!!!

Room was clean. Amenities good. Slightly surprised that they didn't have a small complimentary bottle of water like other hotels. Staff were great we asked for ice and it came promptly. Bedding lovely, shower pressure great. Good value when the territirian rates are on for locals to benefit holidaying in their own city.

I took a group of work contacts who were in KL for a holiday on the 9 Feb, but this time it was a much different story.The first bus was enclosed and was very hot, worn down and dirty. luckily we only had a couple of stops and then we could get off at the KL tower. Next bus was amazing it was the open roof top with the seats open at the front of the bus. The commentary was audible as we traveled through the sights of KL learning about the different monuments. The open air buses give you a 360 view of KL, which is especially spectacular when we go around some of the sky scraper buildings. We got off again in China town to have a look around and the second bus that came by was the same first bus, with even the same bus driver. The enclosed bus didnt have audio it was very full and very hot. The most disappointing thing was that the bus did not stop at the Royal Palace. It skip it entirely, I had told the group how lovely it originally was and then we realized the driver hadn't taken the turn to get us there. I approached the driver and he stammered and stuttered at me, unable to give me an answer for at least 4 minutes. Even when I showed him the map, he looked blank at me and just kept forcing a smile until I left him alone. That was my groups first day in and it was a mix bag of impressions. If you do decide to do this bus tour ensure you get an open air one and also do it early so that the Driver isn't rushing to get home at the end of the day.
Teenz888|D32D9CE8C2B97C0AD112EA8C7CBD38B4|Attractions|Darwin: Skycity Darwin Casino|3| “Breakfast Buffet”|review_347555290|Pretty standard hotel buffet. Get in early as it gets busy after check-out. A good range of fruit and healthier options like poach eggs, cooked spinach, cold meats. It would be a stand out Buffet if they had a daily special of an international breakfast like other international hotels do. Eg, fried rice, Pho, Congee. But can you really expect that from Darwin? Perhaps we can, as it is a very multicultural city that welcomes many from far and wide.Renovations to the layout, decor and lighting have kept this space relevant and fresh . Staff are friendly and efficient. Nice for Breakfast but a little pricey for $28 for what you get. It would also be nice to be allowed to get an a la carte option, if you didn't have the appetite of an "all you can eat" person.

I imagined it to be the experience that we had in Thailand and I wanted to give homage to that holiday we often reminisce about. However the technique did not feel traditional or professional at all, but rather quick, sporadic and grinding. I was expecting the traditional stretching and maneuvering of the body which is a trademark of Thai massages however this was not offered in the more expensive "oil traditional Thai Massage". This was not stipulated on their web page.It felt really rushed and it didn't help that when I called earlier to confirm my time I was asked to come 30 mins earlier than my booked time because "the staff wanted to go home early" she said. Then we were made to wait the 30 mins anyway. Overall it was an average experience that was borderline poor. I wont be coming back in hurry as I will give my business to other Massage parlors that go above and beyond just completing a massage to keep their clients coming back.
Teenz888|D32D9CE8C2B97C0AD112EA8C7CBD38B4|Restaurant|Darwin: Lazy Susans Eating House|4| “St V Day Dinner”|review_347547132|I thought we would try something new for Valentines Day and go somewhere we hadn't tried. Lazy Susan's had a good reputation as it was was a sister venue to some of our other favourites in Darwin. Decor was trendy and not your usual tacky Chinese floor to ceiling wall paper with dragons motifs peppered through the venue. It was simple, bold, tasteful and had a clear identity of what it is. Being V'day a set menu was practical as it keep the wait times very efficient. We were a little shocked to hear that it was $60 a head and were contemplating leaving as we were not told over the phone of the price or contents of the set menu when I booked. We decided to stay and we were glad we did. The food was out promptly, hot, tasty and balanced. Entrees and Mains covered all meat groups, poultry, beef, pork and veggie. The dessert was scrumptious and not overly sweet. It also came with a complimentary cocktail which made the meal quite good value. Not so happy that the sparkling water costed $9, a little steep for bubbles. But now I know that they up-sell you that before you even sit down, so I will decline next time. Drinks Menu was extensive and being a whiskey fan I appreciated the geographical break up of the whiskeys and the quality of brands they offered. I have yet to taste their cocktails.Staff are very attentive and it was nice to see so many staff on for Valentines Day as some business don't staff correctly and patrons end up never returning due to a bad experience on a "special day". To summarise we had a lovely time and sampled a sneak peak of what we could expect from a regular menu if we dined on another night......and if Lazy Susans stays like this then there will be many "another nights".
Teenz888|D32D9CE8C2B97C0AD112EA8C7CBD38B4|Restaurant|Palmerston: k-tong thai & chinese restaurant palmerston|3| “Casual dinner with low expectations”|review_347347024|Its a typical suburban Chinese Takeaway Restaurant complete with daggy decor, panpipe music and sizzling plates. We went for a casual meal somewhere because we couldn't be bothered cooking. We usually go to Red Lantern but it was closed. Other restaurants were fully booked due to Valentine's weekend. They were open and had a few table's free. Ktong's menu is more Thai than Chinese now and the choices are plenty. Our steamed Dim Sims entree were tasty but looked like they had gone through the washing machine. Presentation can improve. Mains where slightly on the salty side but that could be because we don't use very much salt in our cooking. Both mains where priced correctly in accordance to their portion. Big serves that had good ratio of meat to veg. Service is friendly but was a bit slow and inattentive, perhaps that's because they were at 80% capacity and are not used to it. We usually drive by and the restaurant should only a have a handful of tables on normal night. Restaurant could be a bit more cleaner with staff wiping table crumbs directly onto the floor. Tables still a bit greasy. It was all together not bad for a quick last minute dinner out and I think if the place was given a bit of Love and perhaps a complete rebranding to Thai then it has great potential as a venue.

The cafe area has a stunning view of a valley of rice terraces. You can sample all the coffees and teas (served to you on a tasting board ) for free but the Luwak Coffee is about 50,000k. We got one luwak just to taste it between us. if you dont get the Luwak than gratuities are appreciated. It would have been nice to see a food menu to compliment the coffee menu. We would have stayed longer but we were so tired from our climb that we left early. I would recommend this place to anyone.

Beverages and souvenir very expensive. Very boring rides. Very very very long queue. This theme park is more concern about making a snake like queues. Never ending qieues. Long queues will make all the guest felt tired and also felt like giving up of coming to the USS AGAIN. Queue for nearly 1 bour while the rides only last for as long as 2 min. So dissappointing and miserable theme park ever.USS management should limit the number of guest coming to USS to avoid dissappointment among the guests. USS management also should not just think of making money for their own interest without thinking of the guests feeling. This will be my first and last trip to USS. Those guest who read this might want to think twice before coming here.

We did not use any of the utensils (as you might have known, this chalet is shared among all races) hence we brought our own disposable and cooking items. But after checking out early, the chalet now informed us that there is a crack on one of the bowl which we did not even use it. Before checking in, they told us to do inventory check not physical check. If you want to talk about physical check there is so many damage at the chalet. Sliding door not locked as it can only be lock from inside. Crack on the floor and so on. No pictures taken as there are more physical damages found but we were told to do inventory checks and not physical checks.Just a suggestion, maybe upon checking in, one of your staff should show us around to do inventory and physical check with us to highlight what are the damages or shortfall before handing and taking over.Thank you.

I saw a lot of nice picture in this hotel. But so sad, the reality is really different from my expectation. I came at 2.30 PM, which is more than the check in time. But the receptionist said the room is not ready yet, and still in cleaning process. I just confused, it is more than a check in time but still not ready? Receptionist said in 30 minutes, room will be ready. And he told me to wait in a lobby. 30 minutes later, the room still not ready and I should wait for 30 minutes again in a very hot lobby. But it's happen again, the room is not ready after 30 minutes. Then I started angry to the front office, then they brought us to wait in a restaurant and get a welcome drink. What?! We already waited for a very long time and they just let us to wait in a restaurant after I waited too long! Poor us! And the receptionist so unfriendly, they need a lot of training! After received welcome drink, we still wait for almost 1 hour. I asked many times to receptionist and didn't get any proper answer! I got the key and enter the hotel room more almost 5 PM! Felt better because the hotel room is nice and i got a great view from the hotel room. So sad, a nice hotel have a bad service like that. I want to come back for the room, but i don't want to meet unfriendly staff and wait for a bad service again.

They also give us smartphone, with free charge of internet. So we can keep contact with the family without buying local number or use data roaming. But so sorry, the room is so small. Uncomfortable for me who hate a small room. The air conditioner of this hotel was also bad, not cool at all.. and the most important thing is, the staff is really really unfriendly. Her expression is really unpleasant. All question answered by receptionist in a very short answer, look like they hate if we have many question. As your GUEST, you should treat us properly. Be respect to us, we are your customer, and we paid to stayed at your hotel, not for free. Your hotel can't be exists if no one wants to stay at your Hotel. At the end, I extremely not recommend this Hotel for everyone. Bad location, bad service, and bad staff. Never ever come back to this hotel!

But so sorry, the attraction is more appropriate for kids. They only have battlestar galactica and mummy revenge for thriller seeker, I even can said both is not really scary.. you will see a lot of children (about 7 years old) go to this ride, it means that it is not too scary for kids. Another good attraction is transformer, but that's awesome because of the technology, good but not scary at all.. another attraction is just like a kid's toys or modern doll house. Nice, but not for a thriller seeker. You also should be patient in facing unfriendly staff. Most of them is really annoying, their expression shows if they are too tired and always tell everything in a hurry. Not recommended for thriller seeker, but recommended for family and adult who loves relaxing attraction.. hope they will build another serious thrilling attraction for adult and teach their staff to be more friendly.

You can find a lot of variety of foods here! From Chinese, India, until Thai food is available here. They're not really cheap, but they give a reasonable price. The most I love here is the dimsum, it was so tasty and cheap! Only RM 1 / pcs. But be careful for Muslims, because a lot of food here contains porks, please make sure that your ordered is Halal. Happy meal!

I chose deluxe executive and executive suite here. I just surprised, because the room is really nice, more than my expectation. They give me a room in 25th floor, with a direct view to twin tower. So, i don't need to go to twin tower, take a picture from this room is really great! The bed was also so comfort. Before, i planned to check in and go to twin tower and watch some movie in cinema, but after i've looked at the room, i chose to enjoy the room and take twin tower photo from my room. This was so great! They also give us free all mini bar (except alcohol drinks), so I get a lot of snacks and beverages. Because i chose executive class, they also give us free access to lounge all day (to take some beverages and snacks) and evening cocktail for snacking before dinner. I've ordered chocolate with rhum, and that was so fantastic. The breakfast was also nice, but need more variety of food. One a pretty thing that I regret, they did some renovation to the hotel, and my room is so smelly. I can smell thinner and paint, and they don't have any other room without that smell. The only thing they can do is wait until the air purified works. But it is good enough, the smell of the thinner was gone in 3 hours. But it was okay, because they responded me so fast. And while waiting the air purified works, i went to Pavilion Mall. It means that this hotel is really close with shopping center.. A luxury hotel with a great room, great facility, great view, and great location. Wonderful!

I really love this, they serve seafood on ice, barbeque, and also delicious sushi! Everything is so fresh and tasty. If you love chinese food, you can find a delicious dim sum and pecking duck, both were delicious! I saw a lot of food there, i can't even remember all the menu they serve. The service was also so good. They really know and understand what I need. One of them, called Mr. Panji, helps so much to make my dinner become more wonderful. Very recommended restaurant!

It was so close with Gambir and Monas. But so sorry, the decoration of this hotel is really tacky. Feel like go to the wedding reception. The room is so small, and the air conditioner need more freon. The bed and toilet is good enough for the price. At the morning, i went to the restaurant for breakfast. But so sorry, the breakfast was so bad. Lack of variation, and the taste was plain. For you who want to stay near Gambir in budget, you better pay more to get a better hotel.

The portion of bak kut teh is quite big. The soup is really tasteful, the combination between pork broth and pepper is perfect. The meat is also so tender, and still so tasty even they already cook it for several hours. They also have another soup, like organ soup. You can choose lung, liver, kidney, or mix. The other thing that I love from here, If you need more soup, they will pour it into your bowl! Don't forget to buy cak kwee and eat that together with the soup. It's awesome!

You will also love the atmosphere of the restaurant. They have a lot of variety menu for breakfast and dinner buffet. The most delicious is salmon salad, mini burger, and lasagna. If you want to order ala carte, i suggest you to order fish and chips. That's great! Don't forget to ask for butter to get a tastier meal there. Overall is really good, and of course, here is more delicious than Purnawarman Restaurant (Hilton Bandung).

But very surprising, the food was serves yesterday was so bad. There was only a slight variation of food. The noodle was plain, tasted so bad. Dimsum and sushi was also bad. After i tried some main course, i hope the dessert will be good. But I'm totally wrong. Their soes is so terrible, cream inside is tasteless, and the dough of soes is so hard. Taste like yesterday food. The only food that i like is chinese herb soup and lapis legit. But who wants to pay more than 200.000 for only soup and a slice of lapis legit? This is my worst dinner ever at the 5 stars hotel, i could not even finished my food because it was so tasteless. Their service was also bad, they serve everything so slow. How many times I should asked the waiter just to refill my water. All of my friends were really disappointed with the food and service. I think this is my last time have a dinner in Purnawarman. I really hope they make improvement for the customer.

This is so special, because they serve fried chicken with a super delicous cheese sauce. They also sell fire chicken, you can choose the level. That's also unique and delicious. The chicken also great, the meat also tasteful and salty, not like the other's fried chicken. Normally only delicious outside, but plain inside. But richeese is different. Must try!

Finally, CGV Blitz opened in the only mall at the South Bandung. That's a nice cinema, they have 7 theaters, sweetbox (special private seat for couple and premium zone), and also 3D.

The soup was so delicious and tasty. After long time didn't go here, i went here and get 50% discount. I just surprised because the price is quite expensive, more expensive than ikkudo ichi, ikkousha, and marugame. When the food came, the soup was bad, not tasty like before. The noodle was overcooked, and when i asked for garlic, they gave it to me after i finished my meal. So funny. I really miss the old shin men that i loved.

The waiters were also so friendly and nice. But i really hate when they serve a wrong food for me. I ordered some dessert with Nutella Mochi, but they serve me lemon cheese mochi. Then I asked the waiter why they serve different food. They told me if the Nutella mochi was sold out. For me, they should give information about it before i ordered the menu. After i finished my dish, I went to cashier to pay the bill and see so many Nutella mochi at the kitchen. I really ANGRY and say to the cashier about that. He just smile and said sorry for that. So suck. I really hate when someone lied to me, especially to that waiter.

You can see many kind of sundanese food here. You can take rice and food by yourself as much as you want, at the cashier they will count it and tell the price. The price is depend on the menu that you choose and how much you take the food. But for me, the price is to expensive for this kind of food. I should pay about IDR 35k for rice, petai, and cow skin. Too expensive for Bandung. And the place was so dark and hot. So uncomfortable.

They also have a big swimming pool, good for your morning exercise. But so sad, they have a bad quality for breakfast, there is only a few options for your breakfast.

They decorated it and concern to the detail.. the ride was also good enough, they designed every game well. But so sad, they have a very arrogant staff. If you don't follow the rule, they will be angry and say some impolite words (especially yamaha racing coaster). The other staff were also so arrogant and sucks. Their face while i was standing in the line is really sucks, they seems like feel unhappy because there is a lot of people wants to try the rides. There is no smile on their face. But for fair, there is only SOME helpful and good staff. For me, the theme park is too small..i think they should add more rides, at least 5 rides to make it better. I also hate when the carnaval starts and so many ride will be closed during this stupid carnaval. I agree that was nice and good for children, but they should think if there is so many adult inside! After wait a long time, i want to try another ride. But so sad, only me and my friend who wants to try it, their staff said that they will let me play it if only the people more than 6 peoples. But in that time, there is only a few ammount of people there. the staff told me to search another 4 persons who wants try that ride..shame on you trans! If only 2 persons who want to try it, you should let us try that! That is your consequences, not us. The staff is also worked so slow, very slow. That is the reason why we should wait for a long time.At the end i will say that the park was nice, but the staff is sucks.

When the photo session start, they looked so busy and want to finished the photo session so soon, so we should be hurry up. At the end, I received the photo and should pay so expensive for this.

I would definitely give the food a 10 out of 10. The chilli crab was amazing and so was the Mee Goreng. When we arrived we did not have a booking so just went in line to wait for a table. We only waited around 30 mins then were seated. That's where the service stopped. We were offered hot tea and some nuts on the table to start (little did we know they would later charge us for these). We had to get a waiters attention to order, then ask for extra crab crackers as we ordered 2 crabs, then ask for the bibs. The food came out very slow and one at a time. They forgot the rice so again we had to get a waiters attention to re-order the rice. Not once were we asked if the food was ok or if we would like more drinks or offered any water. My sister and I had a bottle of wine that we had to top up our glasses ourselves. Now I don't expect to be waited on constantly but when your paying over $100 per person I do expect a higher level of service. Once we finished our meals again we had to ask for the bill. Would I go back.... As amazing as the food was probably not due to the staff and service.

Check in was quick and easy. Our room was very modern, comfortable and overlooking the ocean and resort pool. The pool is huge and very relaxing. Breakfast has a large variety and was very yummy. Again the staff were happy and friendly. We loved the free shuttle bus to the beach or shopping centre leaving throughout the day, you just have to book 1 hour in advance through reception. The resort is still within walking distance to the heart or Patong if you don't mind waking up the hill to get back. The bus was just easier in the hot weather. Our flight home was late at night so the resort offered to store our bags and still use the resort facilities including the shuttle bus and showers until our arranged car arrived to collect us. This made our afternoon relaxing and stress free. We thank all the staff for being so happy, friendly and accommodating! Would highly recommend to stay here if after a place that's relaxing and away from the busy streets of Patong, but not too far away to join in on the action if you want too! Cannot wait to return!

It's busy but that's half the fun. Little stalls scattered around selling everything from spring rolls to corn on the cob to crispy bugs and loads of fresh fruit and Thai sweets. We ate here most nights as it cost us around $10 for 2 people. Most of the food rages from 10 to 60 Baht so that's around 40c to $3 a meal. We found waking around and purchasing smaller sized meals/snacks the best so we could try more and not fill up on rice dishes. Even the beers were around 60 Baht and cocktails 90 Baht. All the food is fresh and cooked fresh in front of you so we did not worry about getting sick. Just be aware that most of the tables and chairs are owned individually by the stall owners so if you don't buy your food from them then you cannot sit there. Such a fun experience and yummy yummy Thai food.

At night we sat outside to watch the sun set and listen to the music coming from Bangla Rd just the next street across. But once you were inside the room and closed the doors all noise was blocked. It's in the best location, just a short stroll to the beach or the streets of Patong. The shopping center is only an easy 15 minute walk or quick tuk tuk ride. We found it very safe to walk around late at night too. I would like to thank all the staff, they were so friendly, happy and always smiling. Every morning they would ask us what we are doing today and offer any advice. My husband booked a game of golf with the tour desk and it was all planned out perfectly. We cannot wait to return and will hopefully be back very soon to stay again.

It's a beautiful resort on the hill side not too far from the airport (no noise heard from planes taking off or landing). Most reception staff were friendly and helpful, the staff around the resort grounds always smile and say hello. We were upgraded to a king ocean view room which was a pleasant surprise. The room was AMAZING and very close to the pool and breakfast area. They offer buggy service around the resort which would help if your in the higher room areas. There are 2 pools, one down the beach side of the resort and one up the hill. Both can be used by all resort guests. A friendly staff member is always on hand to help you cross the road to access the top or bottom areas of the resort. Breakfast was awesome, huge selection of food available and again friendly staff. My only negatives would be the in room WIFI was poor. We found only 1 person could log in at a time for it to work ok. Being on holiday we rely massively on WIFI to communicate with our friends/family and plan our days. The other was when checking out we asked them to order us a taxi to the airport and they sent us their resort car which ended up costing us way more than a taxi would have for a 10 minute drive. Overall it's a stunning resort, friendly staff and comfortable rooms.

My husband and I payed to see the flower and cloud domes, would highly recommend. Great place to have a picnic and bring the family. At night it all lights up and looks magical. There is even a light show, not too sure what times tho. Easy to access via the MRT. Lots of walking involved so bring comfortable shoes.

My husband and I done both the flower and cloud domes and spent a good 4 hours here wandering around. The waterfall entrance is stunning and the walk from the top to the bottomIs so pretty. We loved looking at all the flowers and taking loads of pictures. Would definitely recommend if visiting Singapore. Easy to access via the MRT too.

Firstly communication with her via email was quick and easy, she always responded straight away and happy to answer any further questions. Pai picked us up from our apartment and took us to the local market to get all the fresh produce. This was great, she bought us a local drink and explained all the things in the market! Was such a unique experience. From there we went to the cooking school and began food prep. She was very clam and explained everything well step by step. Cooking all the food was fun but eating it all was even better. Sooooo yum!! At the end she gave us the left overs, a little sweet snack from the markets and a recipe book then back to our apartment. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Koh Samui. Thank you Pai, you are so sweet and we loved the class.

We were there for sunset and we lucky to get a table on the edge (limited tables/seats). I was happy to pay the $20 entry fee then you can redeem the $20 in the bar... Until I seen the prices! The cocktail list we received from the waitress said $24ea but then she told us the price was wrong and they were $28ea, bit unusual for a high end bar to have the wrong pricing on display. Anyways we all ordered cocktails and paid the difference. They were tasty but not worth the money paid (over $100 for 4 drinks). We sipped on these for a while but were never asked by staff if we wanted more drinks, we had to approach the staff to order some beers (still expensive at around $17ea). Overall we did go up for the view and that was amazing, would have loved to sip on a few more cocktails whilst there but way too overpriced. If you look around you can probably find a similar Singapore view for less money.

Although we booked our tickets online we did not know that we still had to line up in the massive and slow moving queue until we got to the top. So back down we went and waited. The wait is long so try to get there early. Once on the cable car the view is amazing and very high. It's a smooth ride over to Sentosa and only takes around 15 minutes. Once on Sentosa, depending on what you want to do there, ask a staff member for directions as they have a free shuttle bus to take you to the attractions. I would have loved to go back on the cable car at night up to Mt Faber but ran out of time. Overall great view, little bit expensive but I think a must to do in Singapore!

Was an overcast day which I found better as was quiet and not too hot. We had to wait outside the park when we first arrived due to lightening warnings but once the storm cleared we were all allowed in. Plenty of lockers to store your belongings ($20 for the day). Started on a relaxing but fun tube ride around the park! Visited the fish snorkel pool, this was AMAZING and could have been in there all day. Floating jacket, snorkel and goggles all provided for free. Went in the water maze, obstacle course and cannot go past the wave pool and giant tipping bucket. Sooooo much fun and didn't even go on the water slides. Limited food options but I'm sure you could get a pass out and eat some place else on Sentosa then come back in. Remember to bring a towel and change of clothes as the walk back to your accommodation in wet swimmers is not fun! Would definitely return when visiting Singapore again!

Yes it was small but jam packed with so much fun and so many different rides. The Water World show is a must to go see, get there early for splash zone seats. All the rides were awesome, lines not too big and maximum we waited was around 30 minutes, especially late afternoon it was very quiet. Lots of food choices in Universal or can go out to Sentosa to eat then come back in. I would definitely return when visiting Singapore again!

Water was served and drink order taken. Drinks were delivered within 5 minutes. Food was super fast too and yummy. All delivered at the same time (wings, pork belly bites, burgers and fries). Could have brought out the small plates first then the burgers so didn't feel too rushed to try it all before it got cold, but worked out fine! Was so full when we left :-) Will definetly be back to try out more of the menu.

The first time my husband and I visited Artichoke was for a friends birthday function which was awesome! We loved the service, we loved the food and we loved the atmosphere. After having such a positive experience the first time we were very excited to return and have a nice dinner together. This is were it all fell apart. My husband called on a Saturday night to make a booking for Sunday's 7 course degustsation lunch. Unfortunately he was greeted with a very rude staff member over the phone who simply told him he was too busy to give any information about the degustation and call back tomorrow. As we didn't want to chance missing out on a table we asked if we could just make a booking now and then he told us he was too busy and hung up. Needless to say I was disappointed and now turned off ever going back to Artichoke. It simply takes 30 seconds to take a customers booking and no matter how under pressure or busy you may be its just not acceptable from a business.

As I live in QLD all communication was done easily via email to the manager. The location is right on the beautiful Wallis lake with magical views. I would love to return to this restaurant during the day to admire the surroundings. Inside is a little fire place and lounge area, then opening up to large, spacious dining tables. Staff are friendly and helpful. Bar area was a little slow, more staff required to serve. Meals are ordered at the bar then served by the staff to your table. Food was nice and everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their meals, no complaints. Will definetly return on my next visit to Forster/Tuncurry!!

Large drinks/cocktail menu too. Atmosphere is fun, fast paced and chatty. Great location in the heart of broadbeach! Will definetly recommend to our family and friends!

Although we had a booking when greeted at the front and told the host our booking name he just simply asked how many in our party, pointed to a table in the corner and said will that do!! The table was only half set so first impressions not the best sorry! Luckily it did get better with a lovely and helpful waitress and very delicious food. Took a while for drinks to come out, we ended up with entrees before drinks. The atmosphere of the restuarant is good, buzzing environment and beautiful surroundings. Would definitely return for the awesome food!

Firstly the golf course is beautiful especially at sunset. There is an outdoor area where you can sit & enjoy the scenery. The staff are super friendly & very efficient. Dinner arrived within 20 minutes of ordering & the place was busy. Food was very tasty & reasonably priced. There is a little pizza bar at the club too which I will be back to try as they looked amazing.

It was a short 20 minute drive with the driver giving us a tour on the way. It's a beautiful park with lots of wildlife and tracks to walk on to explore. I was so excited to see my first squirrel and eagle. The suspension bridge was scary as I'm not good with heights or things that move. It was not too busy so I just held on for dear life and shuffled my way across. But an amazing view from the bridge. There is a gift shop and food on site. Once finished we took the free shuttle bus back to the city. Loved it!!

It was so much fun and the staff friendly. You have to try out the margaritas with a beer upside down in it and of course the tequila shots. The music was great and the staff have fun with the tourists (this is the part that's not for everyone but you don't have to take part if you don't want too). It's fun to watch tho!! I loved this place and made for a memorable day in Mexico!! Remember to take $1 to the bathroom everytime you go to tip the cleaning staff in there. They are super friendly too, speak little English!!

The staff were amazing, very helpful and efficient. There are signs on your table that you flip over if you want service so the staff don't bother you too much if you don't need them. The food was so yum we ended up eating at 3 other Bubba Gumps during our USA trip. All the meals we tried were great and the cocktails even better. Definitely a place to try out!!

The park was decorated for Halloween and it looked amazing. This was my second time to the park and it's still so much fun. Yes it was super busy and the wait time on rides was over 1 hour but your in Disneyland so who cares. Everyone is happy and the staff friendly and helpful. It's open early (8am) and closes late so plenty of time to experience the whole park. Don't miss the afternoon street parade and nighttime fireworks show (we watched this from our hotel). Food is basic so we took the monorail to downtown Disney for more food options. Thank you Disneyland for bringing out the kid in me :-)

This was our second visit to California Adventure Park and we loved it. The park is open early and closes late so plenty of time to get around and experience all that it has to offer. Make sure to watch the afternoon street parade and the night time light show. The staff are fantastic and always there to help you and guide you in the right direction. A little quieter than Disneyland so the wait time on rides is not too bad. Would recommend getting the 2 park hopper pass so you can move between the 2 parks as you wish.

We had the pool view king room and it was great. Very spacious, bar fridge & what an amazing view from our balcony of the nighttime Disney fireworks. It has a big 24 hour pool, outdoor and indoor bar, restaurant and laundry which is handy when on holidays. Disney is only a short 15 minute walk or you can get the shuttle bus for a few dollars. There is a Starbucks and convenience store across the road and plenty of restaurants at Disney and around the area. Thanks to all the staff for another wonderful stay!!

The staff were great, very friendly and helpful with choosing drinks and meals. The food is super tasty and large quantities to fill you up. We indulged in dessert which was also delicious but we were so full and didn't get to finish it all. My only complaint was towards the end of the night the staff were busy cleaning and packing up that we got a little forgotten about but we were happy to sit and chat until a staff member came and got our dessert order.

From the moment we walked into the building the staff were fantastic and super friendly. We were taken through the safety briefing and equipment with our climb leader Maddy then on our way up the bridge for midnight. I must admit that I was super scared but Maddy made it all very calm, easy and fun. The view was spectacular at night & midnight fireworks AMAZING!

My first contact with the hotel was when I called on check in day to enquire about parking, being NYE I knew it was going to be busy and maybe booked out, it was, but the very helpful staff member Jess ensured me that we could park securely next door. When we arrived later that day we were happily greeted at reception by Jess again & she remembered our previous phone conversation. Check in was fast, easy and informative. Once we parked next door & made our way up to the 16th floor we arrived at our room. It was HUGE, very clean, modern and comfortable. We had a room facing Albert street & overlooking the pool area. We explored the hotel & surrounding areas, the pool is great, many shops/restaurants just outside the hotel, Eagle Street and Casino just down the road + local transport (bus, train, ferry) all within walking distance. Check out again with Jess was fast and easy. This is my new favourite hotel in Brisbane for service, location, quality and value for money. Thanks to Jess for being so amazing!!

We booked the 2 course + wine special for $49ea. The restaurant is beautiful, elegant & comfortable. The staff are friendly & very attentive. The set menu was very basic with minimal choices (steak, fish, pasta). I chose the calamari for entree & barramundi for main. The calamari was amazing but the fish was very bland & i did not finish the meal so left hungry. To order a side of vegetables, potato or chips you are looking at around $11ea, mains only come with green beans. The staff did bring out a dessert plate for my sisters birthday which was a special touch. Not somewhere i would visit again or recommend to family/friends.

The burgers are massive & extremely delicious. There are heaps to choose from & you can even take on the burger challenge!! I have been raving about this place to family & friends & cannot wait to go back.

To start off we booked online & then my husband received a call from the restaurant confirming the booking. When we arrived there was no record of our booking so we were placed on a small table right infornt of the bar & cash register area. It took staff a good 15 minutes to get us menus & then another 10 minutes for a drink order... This was the 1 & only drink we received for the 2 1/2 hours we were there. Once our food order was taken the wait was on. You would not think tapas could take so long to prepare, cook & serve, close to 2 hours. During our long wait for food not once were we asked if we would like more drinks or did we receive an apology for the wait. The staff looked very lost & rushed all night yet it wasn't that busy. The food was average, nothing amazing, atmosphere was not bad, but service very poor.

Saturday nights from 4pm you can taste many delicious cuisines with the food truck style dining including pizza, vegetarian, dumplings, burgers, souvlaki ect all washed down with some of gold coasts finest local beers & wines.

I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the room, it was massive & very comfortable. The hotel lobby is modern & staff friendly. Breakfast was the usual eggs, bacon, toast, cereal, fruit ect. The location is fantastic with easy walking distance to central train station, queen street mall & the casino, also a few 24 hour convenience stores close by. The only negative would be the parking, it was offsite parking a few blocks away in a public secure carpark but it wasn't a big issue! I definitely enjoyed my stay here & will be back in the future :-)

So much food I felt bad sending it back to the kitchen half eaten!! First was the 3 different types of sweet cous cous & porridge, YUM, then came the lamb mince tajine with eggs & bread (my favourite), then we had the platter of eggs, bacon, baked beans, mushrooms, hash browns, tomatoes & sausages, & our last dish was a massive berry pancake with choc sauce & ice cream.... I'm full just thinking of it!! So delicious & would go back again for sure, just remember to book, gets busy!!

Most days we would walk down & have a drink at the many bars with all the friendly Thai bar maids. My advice would be to keep an open mind & remember that you are in a tourist area so people will be trying to sell you goods & hassle you for sales! It pays to learn to basic Thai language (hello, thank you & especially no thank you) as they will respond better when you decline their offer. Yes there are endangered animals for show (do not get photos with them as it only encourages them to take more from the wild), yes they offer ANYONE sex shows, & yes they will hassle for suits & tailored items, but don't this discourage you from the area as this is what their tourist culture has become & just enjoy it! In regards to the many "tailors", it is best to reply 'no thank you'', don't stop to talk & just keep walking unless of course you are after a suit or dress. Good deals can be made with the stalls if you bargain fair & friendly with a smile!!!! Remember they are trying to make a living for themselves & their family!

Effectively a gastro pub which does a reasonably priced two course menu for lunch at £11.95Had looked at website which suggested they did a Monday Club deal at £19.99 per person including a bottle of wine per person, however when I enquirer about this was told they no longer do this offer despite it still being on their websiteWe opted for the two course special and their was lots of options to choose from. I had the spicy Malaysian chicken, one of the party had salad with king prawns and the other salmonFor mains I was boring and had fish and chips (really nice crispy and full of fish) others had the chicken and sausage and mash, all beautifully presented, hot and tasty.We had a carafe of South African red £13.99 and a couple of halves lager and 4 pints of IPA Total bill £88.50Service was excellent, no queuing at the bar which is great when your having a catch up with friendsGot to say toilets absolutely spotless as well Really great afternoon and will return soonWould definitely book at table at weekends as we understand it gets really busy

We sat outside in the courtyard at the back of the restaurant which was really lovely. Didn't order starters so we could leave room to enjoy the steak.I had the 'lady steak' which is a 150g Tenderloin steak which was well adequate for myself and the other lady in our party. Both had it cooked medium rare and it was cooked to perfection.The two gentlemen in the party ordered the 250g Tenderloin steaks again cooked medium rare and we all ordered the steak fries to accompany our steaks. As extras we ordered one side of green beans with bacon and one side spinach with shallots to share.The service was excellent and all staff very friendly.For drinks we ordered a bottle of still water and a bottle of red wine the wine was one of the cheapest on the menu at €27.00Total bill for the four of us was €194.20 which although pricey we thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would return here again.

The tables are on the main walkway and cycle track, but this the only outside seating on what was a sultry evening. The service was friendly and prompt.We ordered a variety of mixed starters (5) which all arrived hot and we found quite tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary to be fair. For drinks we had 3 cocktails and 5 small glasses of wine and two bottles of still water (beware water came out on the bill at €6.80per bottle. Cocktails were nice, but again a little pricey.We all ordered different main courses which were quite substantial had I have known his my husband and I would have shared a main or not had as many starters.I had the Szechuan beef which was probably the most flavoursome of all the orders, one of us ordered the Sticky Korean fried chicken, which was basically three fried chicken drumsticks which arrived and where a little greasy. Two of the party had Kung Pao Chicken, which they thought could have had more flavour.Total bill at €201.60 we feel was pricey for what we had - on reflection we would try other restaurants before returning here.

For mains we had Beef Sichuan with lemon grass served with sticky rice and Salmon marinated in a three flavoured source again with rice.To drink we had a large and a small beer, 2 small glasses of Merlot and a small Prosecco- we thought the drinks especially the wine was a lot more expensive than most other places at 130czk for a 0.15m glass or £4.33 and it wasn't anything special.Total food cost was 896czk or £30.00Drinks 479czk or £16.00 roughly convertedOverall food and service excellent, but wine prices well overpriced in our opinion

Drinks arrived promptly followed by our food order. We both had 'Delicate beef burgers' served with herb seasoned chips cooked in their skins. Burgers came with all the trimmings and even though we both have big appetite s we struggled to finish everything, delicious Total cost for 2 burgers, 0.41 carafe red wine (2 large glasses) and 2 cokes 665kc or roughly £23.00 Would certainly return

Drinks and food orders taken and served all within 30/40 minutes despite the Pub being very full. We just had sandwiches and a pint, all very nice and total cost c. £41 for us all was good value. Dogs are made welcome as with all establishments in the area and given a clean bowl of fresh water.

Despite telling her we were meeting friends she asked us on 3 separate occasions if we wanted buy tickets, quite irritating.Despite having confirmation of breakfast included she advised us that this was a payable extra at €64 each per week.Challenged her on this point and she abruptly told us to take it up with the manager after 9am the following day. Every decision seems to be made through their booking office and no one seems to have any authority at reception We were just given a map of the complex and pointed in the direction of our room. For anyone that's stayed here it's a maze and not easy to find your room - took us 15 minutes to locate it whilst lugging cases.Returned to reception the following day and was handed the phone to argue with their booking office whether or not breakfast was included despite having printed confirmation. The person I spoke to was very rude, discourteous and should never be working in customer service. Later that day we got confirmation that breakfast was indeed included via a different receptionist who couldn't have been nicer.Point about the room, it was described as a one bed junior suite but it's simply a one bed apartment. I did query this with reception and was advised there are no suites, only studio or one and two bed apartments. Don't be misled by the hotel pictures of the balcony area which shows a spacious balcony with sun loungers and what looks like a view of the sea. You actually get a plastic table and four chairs a balcony which is very overlooked by other apartments.The apartment is poorly equipped with no spare cutlery cups or plates if there are four of you staying (sofa in lounge converts to bed) no colander for washing fruit vegetables etc., we went down to the Chinese supermarket to by a few essentials.The maid service is basic with towel change each day, bin emptied and toilet rolls provided and bed linen changed 3 times during our 17 day stay. All the cleaning ladies always greet you with a smile and a hello.The TV has BBC and ITV channels plus a few others. WI fI poor in room, keeps kicking you out but better in the main lobby area. Air con seems to be centrally controlled turning off around 3am and back on from 3 pm.The breakfast was ok but the quality of produce in our opinion wasn't the best ( certainly wouldn't pay €64 each for it) We found it quite irritating that most mornings the restaurant was crammed with time share operatives and their clients on a freebie who seemed to take over. The staff seemed to be tuned into their every need and paying guests were left to their own devices.During our stay weekend got busy with single sex parties staying for the duration of the weekend and can get quite noisy round the pool area and at nightGot to mention a very pleasant girl on the animation team called Tammy who whenever she saw us engaged in conversation and was a total breath of fresh airIn summary I thought what we paid was a fair price for this room however at today's advertised tariff for the same period-which is double what we paid, you can find better accommodation close by if you want to stay in this area.

It was very entertaining.The food was beautiful, how right was the PR girl the food and entertainment was exceptional.I had the prawn and mushroom starter c. €8.6My partner had the salmon on toast at €4.25 both deliciousFor mains we both had fish of the day which was Chernie, which came with a choice of fry's (which where in fact scallop potatoes) or Canarian potatoes with the Mojo dips accompanied with fresh vegetables of the day €12.50 eachThe Chernie was cooked to perfection and was a good thick sized fillet. Best fish I've had to be honest whilst in Tenerrife.Had a bottle of one of the house reds a crianza which from memory was around €14 and really good. The owner Jesus was there and was very hospitable and offered us any drink we wanted on the house when we asked for the bill. They have a very good English speaking waiter who provided excellent service.The whole experience was so enjoyable we returned to eat here Can also strongly recommend the fillet steak at €15 which for us cooked medium rare was perfect We are returning in October and will visit here again and hope to find nothing has changed.

We had a half hour break before mains which where lamb jalfrezi and chicken jalfrezi and a shared portion of pilau rice and as an extra ordered some Naan bread all served steaming hot. In our opinion one portion of rice on its own was insufficient so the naan was a good callAsk to try the house red at €10.50 a bottle though very reasonable was a bit too dry for our pallet so went with the El Coto at €15 which was very nice.The staff are all very polite, friendly and we would certainly return here

Inside was authentically Spanish, we where the only English there. Man behind the bar who spoke little English ushered us to choose a table inside or out so we sat outside on the Patio and he sent out an English speaking waiter to take our order.We only had a 45 minute stop for lunch so ordered a plate of Serrano ham with herbs and mixed cheeses and a cob of bread. Both the ham and cheese was exquisite.There was enough to feed 4 and we washed this down with a glass of sweet tasting Rose ( nicest glass of Rose I have tasted) and a glass of red.Total cost including tax was €13.70 and all served in a timely and pleasant manner so we where back in time for our onward journey. By the way toilets where spotless.

Roughly all branded spirits 3€ for a large measure but sadly the bottle of mixers are quite steep at e.g. Tonic €1.9€2.10 for a large house wine which was not at all bad€3.3 for a pintAlso a quiet area near restaurant you don't want the entertainmentWe felt the restaurant was exceptional value for money. For both breakfast and evening meal there was plenty of choice, which include full English and continental option. Evening had full salad bar, choice of meats, fish, soup desert bar cheese and biscuits Bonus, if you have early check out they will open the restaurant for you to make sure you have something to eat before you leaveAll staff work exceptionally hard and all are very pleasantHotel centrally located with bars and restaurants close by and beach across the roadTaxi to airport roughly €30 including a tipWould definitely return here again 
judith J|1456733329AFFB3FF7726B84EC3C92E7|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|5| “Great Day Out”|review_471413775|Spent a day at the park.Went on a Friday which was relatively quiet as we walked on most rides with a maximum 5 minute wait time.We purchased a ticket which included hotel pick up and transfer to the park, cost £86.00 for the two of us. Return vis the MRT Train system costing £3.50 for us both. That was to Orchard Road City Centre (Holiday Inn) . See separate review for that. If you made your own way to the park on the underground system the park entrance is only £33 each plus of course the £1.75 each train fare.This is a very small park in comparison to the USA, but still worth the entrance fee.Really easy to navigate round the park, you can go left or right on entry and the park is roughly in a circle.On average two rides per area and there are 6 areas to exploreThere are 4 thrill rides, one water rapid ride ( you will get wet, even soaked) The rest of the rides I would describe as family friendly.Other than the rides must do's are Shrek 4D Adventure and Waterworld Live stunt show ( a must see )Plenty of eateries, including ice cream stands catering for all tastes and dietary requirements. Cost of eating and drinking quite reasonable even though you are a captive audience. Note you can't bring your own food and drink in, your bag is searched on entry.All in all had a great day, spent about six hours here only stopping for a half hour lunch

Spectacular display. It's totally free to see this. You can also walk around the gardens surrounding the trees. There's a cactus garden, a small aquarium housing hughe fish. You can wander round the park area housing gardens and ponds. For an additional fee of Singapore Dollar pp you can visit the giant glass houses one of which is a cloud forest.

Pint Peroni 16 SD AND generous glass of decent house wine same at 16 SD + buy one get one free. So about 93 SD or £60 for two mains and 2 drinks each. If you like a drink and don't want to eat early just ask the server to put drinks on the tab before 7pm and they remain in happy hour even if its way past 7pmService very good and friendly, would recommend eating here if you fancy an Italian
judith J|1456733329AFFB3FF7726B84EC3C92E7|Hotel|Singapore: Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre|4| “Singapore Stay”|review_468773460|Typical Holiday Inn, mixed business and holiday travelers Good location, in the heart of the City Centre for anyone who wants to shopClose Ghoby Daut MRT station from where you can travel to all major attractions with ease.Initial room on 4th floor was compact but adequate with the usual tea coffee, complimentary dail water and fridge for your use.Sadly the following day after our late arrival we had to complain to reception regarding the very damp smell in the room. We were offered dehumidifier or a change of room. We opted for the latter and where moved to the sixth floor which was a far bigger and nicer room.We booked this hotel Bed and Breakfast. We felt the break fast room was a little small and at peak times you where on top of each other as the tables were quite close together. Service however was still prompt for tea and coffee however the tea and coffee was served in what I would describe as large transport cafe mugs, not in keeping with a hotel of this standing. Slight confusion and delay at the egg station but no big dealFood generally catered for all tastesI must mention the Concierge service which was brilliant, especially Irwin who was so friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about Singapore. He gave us excellent travel information and places to visit and eat on our first two days. Sadly for us Irwin then went on holiday to Phuket (hope you had a lovely time)The roof top pool is well worth a visit with a good size pool for swimming and a separate children's pool and jacuzzi.Pool towels provided and plenty of sun beds, table and chairs and shaded areas.Gibson the pool attendant always greeted us with a big smile and made us feel most welcome. We both observed how hard Gibson worked to maintain the excellent pool standards.we had drinks a couple of nights in the bar area of the hotel which was very pleasant and a singer provided some entertainment most nights. Cocktails are on a buy one get the second free averaging around 18 Singapore dollars each. Generally most alcoholic drinks are expensive in Singapore but you can find a happy hour in most restaurants if you shop roundSuggest taxi rather than shuttle bus to and from airport as cost is similar if there are two of you around 20 Singapore dollar one way outside peak hours.If you don't want to travel far for evening meal, just behind hotel is Cuppage Street which has quite a number of eateries all in one area catering for most tastes

It had a massive King bed, balcony and lovely walk in shower room. It had the usual tea coffee and mini bar (You can remove the mini bar contents and put your own stuff in).Daily free bottled water supplied and there's a supermarket 5 minutes walk to the left outside the hotel which basically has everything you would need.The room was kept exceptionally clean by Yon.The pool area is excellent with towels and hats provided and pool side service if you want it, prices are a little dearer than you would find downtown but still reasonably priced for drinks and food in the main resturant and snack bars in the hotel.The pool itself is a good size for a swim and the team of gardeners work tirelessly to keep the grounds beautiful. Also at the front of the hotel there are two cold water dispensers where you can refill your water bottles free of charge.Breakfast, what can I say, if you can't find something here to satisfy your palate then you won't anywhere. We were served by Voun most mornings who was very attentive and friendly. I must also say a special thank you to Pat Chan Thorng who went out of her way twice to go and get us some natural yoghurt.Most people never bothered with the outside Kasim Lounge, in fact we were the only two people in there of an afternoon during our stay. They serve lovely afternoon tea and other light bites. We had lunch a couple of times here, surroundings beautiful and we were well served by Sieba, whose smile lit up when he saw you. Impeccable service from Sieba, he even went and found us extra fans to keep us cool on a particularly hot afternoon. By the way anything bought in this resturant gets an automatic 15% discount for hotel residents. Portion sizes are quite big so if you are only looking for a light snack suggest you share one portion. Most priced around $8, large bottle Angkor beer (634m) $5 and a very nice glass of house red $4.5 , then all less 15%. There's a roof top bar/lounge which is nice to sit and watch the sun set with a drink. Free flow drinks including cocktails wine beer etc. and light bites, cost per person $9.99 for an hours stay, however you can sit and finish your drinks for as long as it takes.Great location only 5 minutes in tuk tuk to Pub Street $2 and $3 return, its a standard fare from here so you don't have to negotiate a price just confirm when you get in. All tuk tuk drivers were happy and friendly and there are plenty of them.15/20 minutes from all Temples - we went with a tuk tuk driver Mr Phorne (No 11 tuk tuk) to all the temples. For the day $25 and he took good care of us, even provided chilled water all day and refreshing wipes.We would highly recommend this hotel and would certainly return some time in the future.Thanks all at the Borei for making our stay special

Was able to park the car in the car park though this was full most of the timeThe food was very good and great prices. Sirloin Steak one night and Singapore Noodles the second night. Staff from hotel reception to the resturant were friendly and service was excellentOnly negative is the noise being located on the main road through the town the traffic noice was quite bad especially early morning and the noise generally in the hotel was quite loud (we stayed in room 102 overlooking the car park) All in all sleep quality was poor not helped by the room location which was the first on the corridor which everyone staying in the hotel had to walk past plus we found the pillows to be hard. After saying that I wouldn't hesitate in returning as Shrewsbury has a lot to offer.

The pub itself was fantastic and staff eager to helpReason for not giving it a 5 rating was due to lack of sleep as the side we stayed on was on a busy main road and deliveries to shops etc started at 5.30 am and as the windows are single glazed we were woken early on both mornings we stayed so not a relaxing break as we anticipated but no complaints otherwise and would return if quieter rooms are available

Pool towels providedThere is a 24 hour Restaurant serving international cuisine and breakfast, plus there is a Sushi restaurant and an Italian and ground floor coffee shopAttached to the hotel is Porters bar which is based on a English themed pub and for the area serving very reasonable priced food and drink with live music most evenings (jazz and country western)If you fly with Ethiad you can book this hotel through them and stay 2 nights with breakfast for the price of 1 a real bargain for this 5 star hotel and check in is 24 hours so no waiting around for your room. (Advise take printed copy of your booking confirmation as before this they said our room would not be available until 2pm and we got there at 7am, it was quickly resolved on production of our printed booking form)You can also book a morning city tour, again via Ethiad (2 for 1) but this was not possible for us as the tour doesn't operate on a Friday when we stayed.Hotel is ideally situated for visits to the Grand Mosque ( a must at sunset), return taxi in metered cab c. £12.00. ( taxis generally quite cheap) Mosque free to enter. Also worth a visit is Emirates Palace located at the end of the Corniche ( a real holiday treat would be to take afternoon tea in the palace c. £26 per head)You can then stroll along the Corniche road taking in the beach views.Hotel connects to large shopping mall with many floors of shops and eateries.

We where approached by what turned out to be a conman just outside the hotel saying he saw us in the hotel that evening asking where we where going and offered to show us the way to a couple of local temples. To cut it short he flagged a tuk tuk and gave us a whistle stop tour of the local Budist and Hindu temples and low and behold requested £30 for the tuk tuk ride for what otherwise would have been less than 500 rupees or £3.00. We of course politely declined but other travellers may have felt intimidated, so just a word of caution.Otherwise we enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would recommend it for a short stay

There were options of both rooms and tents. The tents were very nice. They were not only beautiful from the outside but also very tidy, spacious and well done up. The place has a very rajasthani feel with a central area having the desert sand where we had a small bonfire at night and sang songs. The food was very delicious and well made. The owners and managers were very hospitable and eager to fulfill our small requests. Since the establishment has been recently reopened, the pool area and spa were still in process. We went for a camel ride in the day which was nice. We went to an area having clean beautiful sand and playing in that sand was a lot of fun. We also went to the pushkar lake which was 10 minutes by car from the place. Shopping at the market around the lake was a lot of fun. Found a lot of cool stuff at cheap price. All in a all a good trip. Would like to go again with a larger group of friends.

Niranjan L|A66C0D49642C0190459EB23BF3789C9B|Attractions|Kathmandu: Kathmandu Durbar Square|4| “History of Kathmandu”|review_472538762|Kathmandu valley also known as city of gods is a must place to visit if you are ever in Nepal. Nepal is not just about wildlife, white water rafting, trekking/hiking but the history of Nepal's culture, its people, arts and crafts it all worth to see. Kathmandu Durbar Square is full of history in itself. The old monuments, temples, buildings and palaces are a marvel. Although the earthquake has ravaged this beautiful place but slowly it is being brought back to life. Just walking around the city and getting to see the historic landmark of the capital is just amazing.
Niranjan L|A66C0D49642C0190459EB23BF3789C9B|Attractions|Kathmandu: Swayambhunath Temple|4| “Away from the crowd of Kathmandu”|review_471418000|It is a great place for anyone wanting to get away from the crowded Kathmandu central to relax a bit. Just climbing the steep stairs and getting on the top to catch the breathtaking view is great except for the view of the polluted city. But spending a good 1-2 hr enjoying the quietness of the place can be a soother for anyone. Buying a few sovenier after a good bargaining can help you fetch something you can carry back home as a memory too.
Niranjan L|A66C0D49642C0190459EB23BF3789C9B|Attractions|Kathmandu: The Crematoria|4| “How life ends is a must watch act if you in Kathmandu”|review_471414930|Pashupati Nath temple is among the best place for any hindu to visit they say. But for me it is not just for hindu but for all non hindu people too its a must visit place. People coming together for the dead person one last time to help him get a passage to the divine self. It is sad to watch and hear the eerie cry of the beloved ones but i found that as a way of saying goodbye to the loved ones finally. Just to sit opposite the river side of the crematoria and follow the end of the new begining is a new experience to anyone I guess and to experience how it all goes up in flames is quite something.

This universal studio is the right place to keep them occupied. Need at least a whole day to have some fun here otherwise you will be missing out on heaps of things. Please make sure you buy your tickets through the taxi driver its cheaper than buying through the agent. I am a big fan of roller coaster and they have some awesome 1s too. The live show at the water world is great if you are into loud noise gun fires canon balls and water splashes...food and drink is quite expensive inside. Overall it is a great place...my teenager enjoyed his day and always talks about it.

This place is just wonderful. Fully chaotic in a good sense, people everywhere, bars, hotels, pubs, music, food, souvenir shops and many more. Take a stroll and you will see the history of the country...Truly amazing for people who don't mind the noise and the crowd...

Not only wanting to see how wonderful the place is but the history behind it gives us an idea about how civilized and amazing the place was in the past. PASHUPATINATH TEMPLE and its surrounding has been and still a heaven for anybody. The architecture, the monuments, the buildings and moreover the religious value adds to why 1000s of people visit this place everyday. Just to be in the vicinity gives you the tranquil feeling. Sitting by the holy river Bagmati and staring directly at the temple is just breathtaking. Take a walk around the area and one shall immediately find themselves at peace with their inner self. There is so much to do once you get here. If you are in KATHMANDU please take your time to visit this place. Look aside the chaos and the eerie cry of the families of the deceased, by the Holy Bagmati there is more to it. Even the dead find themselves at peace when they come here so imagine what a living human being could seek within.

Nicely landscaped, very relaxing and peaceful, either lie back on one of the hammocks or ease back on the lounge chairs for a nap or quiet read under the shady coconut grove.If you'd like something more exerting then theres the beach and some water sports, banana boat, raft pulled by a jet ski. You can also walk along the beach road or take a short walk up the small hill next to the resort.The sea food is excellent and you can indulge in some unusual items.The only thing that you need to note is order a little extra before you begin coz the service is pretty slow and you maybe left waiting halfway thru ur meal for the roti/bhakri/rice etc. to arriveAlso the veg items are a tad insufficient for two ppl, but the non veg fare is simply superb.Both the Owner Mr Parkar and his wife are very helpful and nice and thanks for accomodating our request for an early breakfast, tho the kitchen usually starts bfast service after 9 Am.

They have 5 really good rides, 3 of them roller coasters, one is the Transformers 3D ride and one a water rapid. They have lots of other roller coasters, shows and rides but they are more for kids or people who like calmer rides. The queues can be quite long, and in case of thunderstorm they will close most of their rides and this not being an unusual happening in Singapore be prepared to take a break in the afternoon. If you don't like queuing I recommend buying an express pass for just 30 dollars.The best thing about this place is that it is not just a theme park, the decoration and atmosphere is magical! Don't expect though too many rides, but look forward to a really wonderful experience.

Also my partner had a soda water and when it was poured into a glass it was flat as if it had already been open, we asked for another one but was charged for two at the end of our meal and was very hard translating the problem with the first one.

It's incredible how it is still balanced on the edge. It's a little prices to get in but worth the cost. Although the truck up and down is an apsolute joke. Getting there was fine but we waited an hour to go down and didn't know why because our truck was full, trucks that were even full after ours left and we were getting frustrated. Turned out there is two more expensive seats in the front and the truck won't go until someone is in there. Once we found out the locals then started pressuring me and my partner to go in the front and pay the extra so we could leave, this part we didn't enjoy.

I ordered the chicken curry which came out within 5 minutes but my partner ordered the chicken kotthu which came out 30 minutes late and long after I finished mine. There was only one other table after us at the time so we couldn't see why it took so long. My curry was fine except the tiny piece of chicken that was all bone but my partners kotthu was very bland and I think he knew that when he out a bottle of chilli sauce next to it. We had kotthu in unawatuna the next day which put this one to shame. I don't wouldn't recommend this restaurant.

We arrived at 7.30 and were the only people there. After looking at drinks menu we ordered drinks while looking at food menu. By the time our drinks arrived it was 8 o clock but still no one else in the restaurant. Eventually ordered and one of our friends wanted a pizza and was told they don't do pizza anymore, that was when we should've left. He then ordered a seafood mix to which she said there was no lobster or squid so she will do it for 4000 instead of 5000. We felt that was still too much and we settled on 2500. Around 8.30 a few more people arrived and ordered but by 8.50 they received their food while we were still waiting. The waitress walked past and said they ordered the set meal which is why it came first. We ordered 3 chicken Currys, grilled prawns and chips and mixed seafood with chips so it was hardly loads of different dishes. We said ok but how long will it be to which see replied 15 minutes. We could hardly believe after waiting 50 minutes it was going to be another 15 with only two other tables in the restaurant. The food arrived just after 9.10 and what arrived was disgusting. All the prawns were over cooked, the mixed seafood was a dry piece of tuna and 3 prawns and 1 head of a prawn no body. The chicken curry had no flavour and it was all bone and barely any meat, most of the fish was left as the accompaniments were all cold. They put our food on a side to bring it over to our table and then left to do something else leaving our rice still on the side getting cold. We complained after the meal as no one came over to us to check and said all the food was very bad and to charge so much for the seafood mix for what you receive isn't good enough. The waitress said she will sort out a refund for our long wait and the bad food which turned out to be 500 rupees. Obviously we argued it and eventually got 1500 rupees off. We could see another table complaining at the same time as us. I wouldn't come here again you can have mch better food on the beach for chaeaper. Lucky tuna is very good and bed space is a must try!

It was fairly busy but food time wasn't long and what was served was incredible. We had chicken satay, pork dumplings and spring rolls to start. All were very well presented and flavours were great. For mains beef burger, chicken burger and souvlaki. Everyone was very impressed. The meat in everything was cooked very well and everything had so much flavour. You could see and taste that everything was fresh the flatbreads were amazing. For dessert we had brownie and banoffee brûlée and again they were incredible. Will return again before we leave.

The grumpiest and unwelcoming person I've ever met. It's great location and the beach is beautiful but he ruins the experience. If you asked questions he just didn't really respond. When we arrived he said it was a set dinner that evening. When we told it was fish and rice I informed him I can't eat fish because of allergies and he said well you can't have anything else you'll have to have rice and salad. Being a chef back home I know you have to accommodate people with allergies even if you have a set menu, something I've always done but he didn't seem to care. Breakfast in the morning I asked for noodles and he said they're not ready. We arrived an hour after breakfast started so how can they not be ready? My partner had pancakes and fruit which came out a minute later, cold pancakes and half a banana. Pancakes are so quick and easy to cook so why cook them in advance and serve them cold with a measly amount of fruit? Scenery stunning accommodation food and staff not worth it

RyanRainValiant|B5619275270BCFA805F7738CD59BDDB5|Hotel|Sanur: The Oasis Lagoon Sanur|5| “EXCELLENT”|review_471001966|Me with my wife and our 2 years old baby stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate Nyepi holiday, from 27-29 March 2017 at the cabana room.We arrived at the hotel around 14:30 pm, was greeted with a friendly smile by the lady reception staff. A quick check-in process, because only 5 minutes we can go into the room. Perhaps because of this quick process, so we were not given a welcome drink :).We delivered by the other staff towards our room (2110) which is located on the first floor, because the cabana room types have private plunge pool.But back there was a slight downback again, because the officers who drove us just put stuff in the room, then walked away without explaining about our room.Although it has a lot of guests do not need an explanation about the contents of the room and also the use to safety box, but I think something like that is mandatory in every service of 4 stars hotel.But this does not dismish our delight to enjoy a holiday in this hotel, we remain positive thinking that maybe that is just a little miss that rarely happens.We got good king bedroom and spacious bathroom, complete amenities and also complete toiletries (soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste, hair dryer, 2 towels large and small, rugs, safety box, slippers, wardrobe with many hangers, large tv with many channels including cartoons which is good for our son, ac worked well and fast equipped with a personal remote, 2 chairs inside, 1 long table, telephone, 2 sunbed and the last is a private plunge pool with cold and clean water).First hairdryer provided did not worked, then we contacted reception and within 5 minutes had been replaced with the new ones.This room is not very soundproof, coz we could hear the noise from the room next to us and the people who walk the hallway.But it does not matter, because it's a natural thing with this type of hotel like this. If we can not accept it, of course we would not choose to vacation here and prefer to vacation with a private villa in the area ubud.The next day, our room cleaned when we were breakfast. The result is very good and perfect, 2 thumbs up for the officers who work in the morning of March 28th.About location is very strategic, close to the beach (about 15 minutes walk), surrounded by many restaurants and other snacks, and there a Hardys market to buy some equipment (2 minute walk). Breakfast provided by the only one restaurant here (Cafe de Dapoer), enough variety (breads, cereals, fruit, rice, noodles and many side dishes). Some item change everyday, but everything always delicious.When Nyepi Day we also had to try to eat at the hotel, the price is not expensive but with yummy food (see my previous review).Maintain and continue to improve services that you provide The Oasis Lagoon Sanur, because we certainly go back and we will tell our friends and others people to stay here if they want a vacation around ​​Sanur area.Warm RegardsRyan Valiant and Family

Club Med atmosphere at Shangri La prices. Not a 5 star experience by any stretch of the imagination..would give it 3 stars at best maybe even 2.Hotel is old and tired - rooms and restaurants are in desperate need of renovation. Public areas in particular restaurants are also not that clean. Windows dirty, floors grubby.Main restaurant is overwhelmed with the number of guest. Like eating in a railway station. Hotel struggle to keep breakfast buffet in an appetizing state as guests swarm over the offering like locusts. Food is lack lustre. A wide offering but nothing really to choose. Hotel is child friendly but that also means a ridiculous number of children as a result. Main pool is like a public swimming baths during school holidays when there is a discount offer on !The beach is a great photo opportunity however as you venture closer sand is dirty and water murky.. the price for being situated in one of the world's busiests ports.We enjoyed our weekend but really felt short changed. Expected Shangri La and got far far less.

Thank you.The food - oh dear - the Head Chef must have been on holiday. It had all the ingredients but lacked imagination and fell short on execution and attention to detail. The offering lacked pride from the kitchen team - for any self respecting Chefs who are on top of their game would not have let many of the dishes leave the kitchen. A few examples:- Smoked salmon lacked condiments and hence was bland- Crab and sea food overall was fantastic but extremely slow in being replenished (I suspect many guests dwelled on the sea food buffet due to the lack lustre carvery)- Turkey was dry and over cooked - also slow to replenish. Poor chap carving was hacking away at the dry meat serving it crumbs.- Beef was tough despite being medium/rare. - Vegetables were cold and soggy- one could have smashed a window with the Yorkshire puddings - I humbly refer the Chef to the BBC good food website for a more delicate recipe!- Desserts were stodgy and dry - only cheese plate was worth sampling- there were several dishes which could be ordered off a tasting menu. These arrived cold with the sauce congealed around the main ingredient. They were tasty - but must have been lying around the kitchen under a hot light for a while before hitting our table.I could go on - plenty more examples - but I think I have made my point!For a Xmas day lunch the decor lacked imagination and style. Very coffee shop like/boring.Sorry team - I am a big Mandarin Oriental Group fan and have also had several lovely meals in your Jakarta hotel - this time however you missed the mark by a country mile - the kitchen did not play their A game, nor even their B game.....

The resulting continuous milling of people around tables and the buffet gives the ambience of a railway station cafe during rush hour.The food looks nice however flavours are lack lustre. The roast beef was tough as leather, the roast pork had an unpleasant strong smell and was violently hacked into shreds by the attending chef rather than being carved. The peking duck appeared to be wrapped in stale yellow wraps rather than fine fresh pancakes. The sushi counter was a scrum of guests reaching over each other to grab as much as they could - with not enough chilling or ice around for my liking to keep the fish fresh. I could take this buffet apart counter by counter or even dish bybl dish - in simple not five star, not 4 star and it would even be unfair to 3 star hotels to accuse them of being in the same league!Service was not existant - I was not offered a drink throughout the meal and my water glass was filled up once. The team struggled to clear plates. This suspect goes back to my earlier point on the restaurant be grossly over crowded.A simple recommendation - do not go to this brunch even if wild horses are dragging you. It hss also put me off even trying Satoo on a non-brunch day.

The scallops were phenomenal, perfectly cooked and the highlight of the meal. The lamb, pork and chicken were all tasty however - bearing in mind the restaurant was not too busy - all three were overcooked/dry which was a pity.We drank a lovely and very reasonable Pouilly Fume which was a great accompaniment to the meal.Great selection of Cheeses and delicious Petit Fours to finish of the meal.Overall an interesting concept and great flavours - not bad - worth a visit.

One can imagine the victorian splendour as one walks up the grand entrance however much of that splendour has gone.The hotel is under refurbishment and the refurbished rooms are modern and fresh. The refurbished decor is a cross between Ikea and Habitat - which sort of works in the rooms but looks a bit lost in the cavernous dining hall. Refurbishment is still underway however does not intrude on your stay.Food is okay - service friendly albeit a bit amateur. There are lots of nice eateries in the area so would encourage guests to have a good lunch outside whilst they are out and about.The bar in the main corridor and the gin glass house are a quirky addition - not convinced it works as a concept but nevertheless enjoyed a drink and the views.As stands hotel is an eclectic mix of youth hostel, 2 star, 3 star and 4 star - with a hint of Fawlty Towers on occasion. All in all good value for money, beautiful location - so not fair to be too critical - however frustrating because it could be so much more.

Staff are exceptionally rude when asked for help. Singapore is very small. You can easily walk between many locations. Taxis and Uber are so reasonable in Singapore and traffic very light even in rush hour - so if you are travelling with 3 or more people I would avoid the MRT and either walk or take taxi.

Was pleased to see the hotel and facilities have been kept current, albeit the room we were in was very 90's and a little bit tired.

Over all food was excellent - can highly recommend the signature "Hainan Chicken" in Melt and room service (had it twice!)Hotel is clean and tidy. Staff are exceptional - a couple of them let the side down - but on the whole always courteous, greeted by name and anticipated needs.Would definitely stay again.

The hawker center's food is authentic and economical. However, the place is not so clean , hot n humid but worth the trip. Dress down n wear loose clothes so as the perspiration will not get into you. Most of the food stalls serves good food but those with long queues, serves great food. Walk around the Chinatown area and enjoy the sights.

It is better to go after 9 pm when the crowd is lesser....the trip was more for the kids as we can come up close and personal with some of these animals such as the antelopes, deer...and can see Lion, Tigers, Elephants from a short distant. It was pleasant ride on the tram. The food is rather expensive so it may be economical to prepare some food on your own or have a good meal first before going to the Noght Safari....trip is more for family with young kids.

Unfortunately, the pool was small but the gym was good. Overall, the hotel need to have some programs or activities to spice up the hotel . Check in was quick and easy. But have to get the car park coupon everytime we need to get out of the hotel. Was slightly cumbersome. Other than that, it was a great weekend staycation.

They broke the Guinness record for the fastest lift to travel from 1-89 floor. It was worth the money and it has a breathing taking view. We could see to whole city of Taipei . We found out that the highest floor was 2 floors away from 89 and thus, we went up to the 91st floor to view the outdoor observatory.

It has simple 'basics' animals in the zoo. Recommended to take a tram up to the zoo and walk downwards...if the weather is good , the zoo will be a great place to be in. Expected much but was a little disappointed.

It has a laundry room to wash and dry your clothes. This is a plus point of the hotel. Location wise is also good and not far from the night market. Great for family with children as well. No need to ask for rooms with windows as it does not help. 7-11 is just at the ground floor and there is a great Shabu Shabu restaurant on the second floor but entrance is on the other side of the road.

In the meantime, it has a good variety of shops, supermarkets, department stores, specialty stores and discount shops plus a food court. Parking can be difficult at peak periods like anywhere I guess. At this stage the main outlets are Coles and Woolworths, Myer, David Jones and Kmart. The only Apple Store outside of the city is here and there are some decent fashion stores including Zara. There are several coffee places including a dine-in Miss Maud at one end and a walk-up bakery at the other. The coffee at Coffea near Coles is particularly good. This is my local shopping centre and only a few blocks from my house. I really wish they had a Target, then I'd probably not venture many other places to shop.

Bring a picnic or your fish and chips when the weather is fine or just enjoy the amazing views and photo ops year round. Set in a Heritage precinct, this is a great place to bring visitors. Plenty of room for kids (or adults!) to run and play and kick a footy. Well marked with plaques explaining local and wartime history through the decades.

Skinny latte was good too and the service was friendly.

They're usually pretty crowded but there's good reason. Apart from the little stalls selling all kinds of handcrafts and random goods and the fruit and veg at the back are top notch and well priced (hint: don't buy anything until you've done a full circuit as the prices toward the back are often better than the part abutting the food/coffee area). There's also great coffee to be had and a range of fresh food stalls with everything from paella to bao to gozleme to juices. My favourite go-to is a coffee from Black Cherries and a warm blackberry jam donut from Levi's Donuts.

Everything is always really fresh, the chips are proper fresh corn chips instead of triangles of stiff cardboard out of a giant catering bag and I really love that they actually have a condiments bar complete with fresh coriander, red onion and jalapeños. Family favourite.

Great for swimming, surfing, fishing, picnics, photos ops. In summer, fish and chips on the lawn at sunset is just perfect if not too windy. Sunset photo ops abound year round.
ozmig5|21D6D7BCF2BB270CA08745D3E04244CA|Attractions|Greater Perth: John Forrest National Park|5| “Stunning”|review_509293855|This is a gorgeous national park an easy drive from Perth. It's currently $12 per car (or van seating up to 12 people) to enter but well worth it. Have a meal at the tavern if you like but I thoroughly recommend taking a picnic or BBQ. There are plenty of picnic tables or even great little shelters like mini cabins for shade or shelter with picnic tables in them. Jane Brook runs through here and there's a plethora of hiking trails with interesting things to see and gorgeous scenery in every direction. The main hike is along the abandoned railway which can take you to Hovea Falls and beyond in one direction or all the way down to Swan View past the National Park Falls and through the wonderful old railway tunnel in the other. Amazing views to be had and lots of interesting historical plaques along the way. Great for the whole family as the main trail is very easy and mostly flat. Popular with cyclists and hikers alike. Easy to spend a full day out here. Highly recommend.

They still serve real pints at a good price and the pub grub is spot on and very affordable. Great choice too and the servers do a great job even when it's busy. It still looks and feels like the old Aussie pub inside and is perfect for a meal by the fireplace in the winter or sit outside when the weather is nice. Try combining a trip here with a drive to or from Mundaring Weir along Mundaring Weir Rd for beautiful scenery and plenty of places to stop and enjoy the Australian bush. Or head down to the infamous Zig Zag for a hair-raising ride down to the bottom of the hill with views of the city. Oh - and for paranormal enthusiasts - there are plenty of ghosts in the old hotel

The setting in the lovely botanic gardens is just beautiful and it's wonderful to see how it's changed since I was a little girl. You can still easily kill a day at this zoo, the exhibits are relevant and informative and I love some of the important conservation work this zoo is involved with. Lovely day out for the family and with the ferry across to Elizabeth Quay within walking distance you can really make a great day of it. Stop in at Mr Walker for coffee or a delicious meal or head into the Windsor Hotel for a drink.

I was the only westerner in the packed restaurant and the food was amazing. By the time we finished people were waiting outside for a free table - even though the weather was rainy and cold. Will be back!

Great food, service and lovely coffee! Plus they use A2 milk which is so much kinder to my tummy which doesn't often handle dairy too well. My daughter had the mixed mushrooms with scrambled eggs and I had the Jill's - poached eggs, spinach, asparagus, avocado, mushrooms, tomato and grilled haloumi. Delicious! We'll be heading to Kalamunda more often!
ozmig5|21D6D7BCF2BB270CA08745D3E04244CA|Attractions|Mundaring: Mundaring Weir|4| “Lovely year round”|review_506681944|This is a family favourite as I grew up in this area. The setting is stunning and there's lots of important history associated with the place. There are plenty of nooks and crannies both at the weir itself and off the little tracks surrounding it with picnic tables and bbqs including old fashioned wood ones with wood supplied. The hotel nearby is well worth a visit as is the museum onsite. The area at the top entrance to the weir is a FABULOUS place to spot kangaroos in the wild. Do be aware that there is construction going on at the moment and not everything is accessible right now. Today the gates on the weir wall itself were closed which was a bit disappointing. If you're looking for a lovely drive try Mundaring Weir Rd between Mundaring and Kalamunda. There are lots of lovely places to have coffee or a meal in both places so it's a great day trip and very scenic.

Had lunch with a client here yesterday and the service was good and the food yummy. I had the Thai beef salad and it was really excellent. My one complaint would be that it was a freezing blustery day and it would've been good if they'd closed the doors over a bit.

Definitely above average in my opinion. There's also a good selection of various Asian foods as well as a decent coffee place, burgers, salads and a bistro style offering. It is always terribly busy on weekdays as it's popular with city workers and shoppers alike. It can be very difficult to get a table - especially if you're with a group.
ozmig5|21D6D7BCF2BB270CA08745D3E04244CA|Restaurant|Perth: Dome Eastend|4| “Consistent ”|review_504646472|Dome cops some flack but we really find it a nice safe family favourite. Warm and cosy in the winter and a cool oasis in the summer, there's a nice selection of cool drinks, frappes, milkshakes and hot drinks. You can grab anything from tasty cakes and baked goods through to light meals and even a decent feed. The kids' menu is way better than most with heaps of choice and they always have pencils and colouring and activity sheets. Today my 10yo enjoyed the chicken tenders with chips and salad and a Fluffy Koala kids' frappe and I had the vegetarian lasagne with salad and a large latte. Everything was lovely. Definitely recommend for families with a lot of tastes to please.

It's lovely wandering around tasting all the delicious things. Our favourites would be the vinegars and olive oils but it's hard to go past the dressings and the jams and curds. This trip we came away with cherry balsamic, passionfruit curd and mulled cider mix and it's hard not to think of all the yummy things we nearly bought and left behind! I also love their homewares and kitchen gadgets. It's lovely to have a wander around the beautiful kitchen garden here and it's dangerously close to the Margaret River Chocolate Company as well.

This was one of the recently renovated ones and we were very impressed. The cabin was very spacious and modern with its own equipped kitchen, dining table, lounge area with TV and DVD player, new semi-ensuite bathroom with heat lights and two bedrooms with extremely comfy beds. It was too wet to use our little patio area but it would be great in the summer, positioned a short distance from one of the BBQs. The Resort had several facilities we didn't have time to enjoy as we were too busy seeing the sights. The Resort is well positioned to make it a great jumping off point for area attractions. We got a great deal through Expedia and would definitely book again - we're already talking about next time!

Unfortunately we didn't see the blackboard menu and chose from the limited print menu. It looked like there were some nice offerings on the blackboard menu given what we saw others having. However the burgers we chose were delicious and fresh with home made patties and the coffee was very good. The staff were friendly and welcoming. Look forward to trying something off the blackboard next time :)

They also explain the local aboriginal stories around this cave and what it meant for them. Then you head down to explore the caves for yourself. Be warned - there are LOTS of stairs and some narrow and low clearance areas. You don't have to crawl or anything but those with claustrophobic tendencies or limited mobility would definitely struggle. Beautiful cave. Well worth a visit.

Be really careful if the decking is wet on the footbridges though because that means a big swell might come up and drench you! It's worth clambering over the rocks for views the footbridges don't afford you. Bring the camera!

The cheese tastings are a favourite and we always end up buying some of our favourite cheeses - port cheddar, sweet chilli cheddar or some Camembert. We usually enjoy a milkshake too. I do miss the viewing window and the fresh ricotta though.

The location is perfect of course, with its view over the beach toward the iconic Busselton Jetty, but so was the coffee, the delicious food, the warm and prompt friendly service and the gorgeous decor and general vibe. Looking forward to visiting again next time we're down.

Visitors can get some great holiday snaps here, including one of the sign pointing out where the Indian Ocean ends and the Southern Ocean begins. It's often a great place for spotting whales and dolphins and you can grab coffee and snacks in the coffee shop with its adjoining souvenir shop and info rooms (museum style but small).

It's fun to watch them making the different candies and we never leave empty handed. We were a bit disappointed this time as there were no Rosy Apples which are my eldest daughter's favourite. Happily they still carry my favourite Cashew Crunch :)

The lady who looked after us was very bubbly and kind. The paper menu was on the table for us but it wasn't until after we ordered that I realised the other tables also had some other kind of menu as well. Not sure what it offered. I also had to request the wine list later as there wasn't one of those on our table either. We had the pork belly, the orecchiette with duck ragu and the BBQ short ribs. The pork belly and pasta were nice though a little bland and unfortunately the ribs were maybe not slow cooked quite long enough as the waitperson was surprised that we had to request a steak knife in order to cut it. Still, we enjoyed our lunch accompanied by a glass of the really lovely Eagle Bay Wilyabrup Cab Sav which I highly recommend.

The communal dining style is actually quite lovely. The wine selection is excellent and the food is always fabulous. You'd be crazy not to start with the selection of amazing breads with a variety of toppings or dips. The staff are warm and friendly and helpful. It can be very busy at weekends but is well worth the wait as it really is a wonderful happiness-inducing dining experience.

The coffee is always good, the staff are pleasant and helpful and the food is delicious and has just enough variety to please everyone in our group. Parking is usually easy at weekends as surrounding businesses are usually closed - a plus for a good weekend brunch spot.

There's really nothing not to like as the line out the door for Sunday brunch attests. This last visit was with both daughters and my sister for her birthday brunch as she's never been. We ordered the breakfast bruschetta, buckwheat pancakes, avo toast with a side of bacon and a granola a bowl. But then we decided to share a piece of cake while we waited for our food as it's really a crime not to eat the wonderful vegan cakes here (and none of us are vegan!). The food was delicious, the coffee on point, the service amiable and efficient and the ambience is always lovely, inside or out with a variety of seating spaces to choose from. Highly recommend!

ozmig5|21D6D7BCF2BB270CA08745D3E04244CA|Restaurant|Fremantle: Propeller|5| “Stunning food & great staff”|review_488595991|Have been meaning to pop in here for ages and finally did for brunch with my daughter last week. It did not disappoint. My daughter ordered the Potato, Green Onion, Pecorino Waffle and I had the Knafeh with a side of house-smoked bacon. Both were divine and heaven in our mouths! The knafeh, served with rose syrup, oranges, raspberries and pistachios, was just a perfect mix of sweet, tart and savoury flavours and a wonderful confluence of crunchy, juicy, melty textures. Highly recommended and the bacon was the perfect side. Our coffees were perfect too. Will definitely be back!
ozmig5|21D6D7BCF2BB270CA08745D3E04244CA|Restaurant|Perth: Garden thai cuisine|5| “Red Basil in a Bigger Venue”|review_488422770|Last time we ate at the popular Red Basil Thai in Victoria Park the staff told us they'd opened another restaurant further up Albany Highway in East Victoria Park. We booked at Garden Thai for my dad's 77th birthday dinner as Red Basil could not accommodate our party of 11. We were not disappointed in any way. The food was just as good, the staff just as helpful and efficient and the venue was a lovely old character house on a corner and included seating in the lovely garden out the back or on the paved area to the front as well as inside. Our large party was seated inside on a nippy Sunday night at a lovely long table in a room we had to ourselves. Will be recommending for other large groups or for couples who might want a little more privacy and ambiance that the smaller busier Red Basil lacks.

I can honestly say we were not disappointed in everything. Full of flavour, beautifully presented and hearty portions. Service was quick, friendly and efficient. Already planking two more visits for family celebrations. Can't wait!
ozmig5|21D6D7BCF2BB270CA08745D3E04244CA|Attractions|Jandakot: Flight City Simulation Centre|5| “Fabulous!”|review_478994481|We had the most incredible time at Flight City! I was terribly intimidated at first but Gavin did a wonderful job of taking us through everything so carefully in language we could all understand. One of the coolest things about this sim is that it's located in a hangar at a busy working airport so it's really immersive. We started in the hangar with Gavin explaining some basic aerodynamics demonstrated on a Cessna. Then we took it in turns to "fly" the Boeing 777 from the left seat in the cockpit while the others kicked back in the first class lounge where they could see and hear everything going on in the cockpit while they enjoyed drinks. In the cockpit, we started at Hong King's KaiTak airport where Gavin takes you through everything from firing everything up and pushing back right through to takeoff and then circling back around to land again on that short runway. That experience takes about 25 minutes. Absolutely wonderful experience I highly recommend. They have a variety of experiences available as pilots often use the sim as prep for their interviews with the big airlines.

Decent menu, lovely staff and a range of seating options from the wrap around verandah to the formal areas at the back flowing out to the shady garden with water feature. Really good summer vibe when there's a band on and the sun is shining but I've enjoyed a drink and chilli mussels near the front bar during a torrential downpour too

Don't think that the little shopfront and side garden is all there is to this place - wander through the side garden to the lovely oasis at the back with its lush gardens and water feature with plenty of tables under umbrellas or along the verandah. Very family friendly but also perfect for relaxed business lunches, this place has a lovely menu, delicious food, good coffee and prompt and friendly service. Great for a coffee or a full meal, I'm never disappointed.

Families, couples, singles, locals and foreigners can all be found here enjoying the stretches of lawn, the Flame of Remembrance, the whispering wall, the gorgeous gardens, the views and of course the memorial itself. The spot is a favourite place for locals to enjoy a picnic dinner in the warmer months as the sunsets and the lights twinkle on over the city. Photo ops abound. Fab place to watch a storm roll in or to see the fireworks on Australia Day. Of course, the standout event here is Anzac Day every year. Always a beautiful dawn service and always packed with those who travel from all over the state to pay the respects to the Great Fallen.

Even on busy days you can usually get parking which is a real positive for beachside eateries along this strip (especially with the debacle at Scarbs right now). The young lady taking orders was delightful. Other staff don't really engage and seemed a little aloof but they get the job done. Lots of options on the brekky/brunch menu. Coffee was decent. Food looked lovely but poached eggs were undercooked and the food was just a bit bland (last visit we had the corn fritters and the polenta stack).

A regular haunt for me and my best girlfriends, we are never disappointed in the food or service. We always order the platter which comes with three kinds of chicken - sweet chilli, soy and garlic and original (and we ask for boneless) - 3 kinds of salad which they make fresh daily and their lovely seasoned fries. Everything is always hit and fresh and their chicken is delivered fresh (not frozen) every morning. Most of the time the platter feeds the four of us with leftovers for only $36 ($34 plus extra $2 for boneless). The service is always very kind and friendly and nothing is ever too much trouble. No wonder we keep coming back!
ozmig5|21D6D7BCF2BB270CA08745D3E04244CA|Restaurant|Singapore: Ellenborough Market Cafe|5| “Lovely breakfast buffet and delightful staff!”|review_470799257|Can only speak to the breakfast buffet here which we included in our hotel package. We were very happy and satisfied with the food and service. We were always welcomed congenially at the door and shown to a lovely table and immediately asked whether we would like a pot of tea or coffee and hot chocolate for my 10yo. The buffet was VERY extensive given this was only brekky! One area had everything including cold cereal, bircher muesli, fresh fruit, cold cuts and a selection of juices. The next zone had bacon (crispy or soft), baked beans, chicken sausages, beef sausages or pork and cheese, grilled tomato, wedges or hash browns , etc. the next was a variety of breads for toasting, fresh Danish pastries and croissants, a cheese board, an egg station (omelettes or fried made to order by Colin and staff), French toast, pancakes and waffles with a selection of toppings and syrups. There was also a refrigerated cabinet with a selection of yogurts in little glass jars. Next was the Asian breakfast buffet with steamed dumplings (including scallops!), scrambled eggs, plain congee or crab porridge, otek otek, noodle soups cooked to order and a selection of items such as fish fingers, spicy fried chicken drumettes, veg spring rolls, etc. Not only was this a great start to our day each morning but it also lined our tummies enough that we didn't need to eat again until mid to late afternoon. From the cafe we could easily go back to our room to finish preparing for the day, head back to concierge for help or just go straight out the front doors to the riverwalk and Clarke Quay with handy access to the MRT. Would not hesitate to add the Ellenborough breakfast to our package at our next stay.

We returned to reception at 11 am  and they anounced us that our room is ready!!Our room was in the ground floor with a balcony of an enterance door of hotel's view !!!All facilities,except iron are existed in our room .I think that they have to provide iron for all rooms in the future.Rixos premium has a very big restaurant that I have ever seen!If you are interested in any foods you can find them in this restaurantfor breakfast,launch and dinner(such as Suchi,kebab,...) .Also it has  special foods for diabetic or vegeterian people.So please don't worry about food in Rixos oremium hotel!Also it has 7 A la carte restaurant  but you have to reserve them 1 day before.I went to steak house,Italian and Turkish restaurant and I suggest them to you.Hotel has a lot of ameneties and entertainments for kids and adults so you will not  be tired during staying in this hotel.I suppose this hotel for any person who like to be relax with his family in the hotel ,But if you like to go to Bazar or mall its so far from any of them.

Our room had two TV, one of both in the bathroom. Bathroom had a very big window that you could see Water park through it! Breakfast was good but it is better to be more versatile for different days and for the different tastes of different countries.A shuttle bus from hotel go to other hotels and come back to hotel every 15 minutes. So you can easily go to the heart of Sentosa island like as universal studio and etc .Also if you want to go to Singapore city it has a very nice mono rail and you can go to city and come back to sentosa island by mono rail without paying any money!I suggest this hotel for every family that want to be in a five star hotel in Singapore with easily access to entertainments of Sentosa island like as water park, universal studio and …

Hotel is very far from phuket and you can not easily access to phuket and I think this the main problem of hotel.

The one drawback is it is quite a long trip to the city of Bali from our country.

The pool is salt water and is lovely to swim in. The room was clean when we checked in but we noticed that it was not cleaned properly each day we were there. Also they changed the hot water system half way through our stay and the 'hot' water was no longer 'hot' but tepid. Wi-Fi is only available on the pool level and café level. We found it frustrating not being able to access the Wi-Fi from our room. Hotel is in good location on Sentosa as you can easily walk to other locations. Breakfast is good.

We could not sleep with the air-conditioner on. And as it is hot weather in Bangkok it made for a very uncomfortable nights sleep. I complained to management on two separate occasions. Their solution was to put an oil burner in the room which on its own emitted an awful smell. We believe the air-conditioning unit is not maintained properly.

There was supposed to be an acrobatic show which was advertised on our entry ticket but it never happened and we couldn't get any information on whether it would be going ahead or not so we left.

The resort is secluded for just the guests. You feel safe walking at any time. The staff are very helpful. The pool is great. Tge breakfast is good too and the restaurants around have nice food. The Beach is clean but the tide goes out every afternoon so it is a long walk to the ocean water to swim. Behind the resort wall is the village with cheap restaurants, bars and massage places.

The sand may be white but the ocean is dirty green. There are also lots of massage areas every few steps so you are constantly being hassled. The Beach is busy with lots of people too. Karon Beach which is a 10 min drive away has clean blue ocean and no massage areas on the beach. Less busy with people.

The park itself which houses different types of birds is not that special. Unfortunately all the descriptions of the birds is in Thai so unless you read and write Thai you won't be able to learn about each of the birds. I found this disappointing as there is no point just looking at a bird and not knowing where it originates from and what its special features are. The compere of the bird show was extremely difficult to understand and at one point in the show those of us in the audience were puzzled as to what he was asking. I think he was after audience participation but who knows?

Nothing special or out of the ordinary. Good thing is you can taste each product before you buy. As is usual here in Phuket as soon as you enter any store you are followed by a girl with a basket so you make large purchases.

We bought a 3 day pass which is the better value. The hotel concierge directed us to the closest stop to our hotel. We found it very frustrating that there is no signage on any of the bus stops which indicate which stop these buses use. And when we went to buy our tickets on getting on the bus the driver wanted cash only - even though he had a portable card machine. We were then taken to the depot instead of the route advertised. When we were at the depot we complained to management that we had to pay cash. We were told that this is the method of payment. But the brochure does not state that. Then when we asked why the bus went to the depot instead of the yellow bus route that we were on. We were told that the first two buses of the morning pick up all passengers and take them to the depot so passengers choose the line they want. Again, this is not stated on their brochure. The safari line is advertised as leaving every 30 mins however when we went to the depot to get the safari line we had to wait almost an hour as they don't run every 30 mins but every hour. Again the brochure is incorrect.
Margherita L|77FD1A3AEB3AC5563A82C504932AAE27|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Zoo|2| “Disappointing”|review_466421291|We did not see many animals on the day we visited. They were all hiding. I would have to presume it was because it was a very hot day. I really wanted to see the white tiger and only just managed to catch the last 5 mins of the feeding show. After the tiger was fed he ran to a gate and it was opened from the other side and then disappeared from view never to be seen again? It did not go to a viewing glass area. The lion was nowhere to be seen either. The two lionesses were up against the glass viewing area which was amazing as I was able to take close up photos. The zoo needs to display the feeding times for all the animals as you enter the grounds so you have an opportunity to see them all. I would recommend that one gets these times before starting to walk the zoo so you can at least view all the animals. Alternatively the zoo does have a night safari. Perhaps this is the best option of seeing the animals during the hot weather.

The Interpretative Centre was closed so I would check it is open before making the journey as I'm sure it would be interesting to see this also. It is possible to drive to see the Pinnacles from Perth and back in one day. I recommend that it be a day's outing so you can visit the seaside towns along the way to stop and have breaks.

On the Saturday night there was a private function with a full music band playing. The music was so loud in our room (with doors/windows shut and airconditioning on) we put ear plugs into our ears.

Take line 3 and the stop to get off is the Tily-Xiu station. The Pullman offers buffet breakfast which has a reasonable offering (though not cheap).

The room was good size and bed comfortable. Shower was hot too with good spray. We even had a microwave which was very convenient as there is a supermarket/deli just a minute away that has a variety of prepared meals. We bought most of our meals from this store while staying in New York.The location is great too. One block away from Times Square and Broadway.

Our driver was very organised which meant that we did not have to wait to do the gondola ride at Sulphur Mountain. He also provided great history information of Banff while driving us around. He was informative and efficient.

Truly magnificent. We also did the Maid of the Mist boat tour which takes you right up close to the Falls. You really experience the power in the falls on this boat ride. It is an amazing sight to see. The gardens are also worth seeing. There were large plots of tulips in different colours and daffodils which were all beautiful. We took a tour bus which drove us from NY to the Falls on the Canada side. We stayed overnight in a hotel on the Canada side. A tip for anyone considering doing this - it's a long drive there and back. We didn't realise it was a full day driving each way. Perhaps hiring a car and driving yourself is quicker?
Margherita L|77FD1A3AEB3AC5563A82C504932AAE27|Attractions|Maui: Hana Highway - Road to Hana|5| “Great day”|review_270286223|We did the road to and from Hana with a tour company Polynesian Adventure Tours. It was a great way to see the best bits of Maui and the famous Road to Hana. Although it is a long day we saw breathtaking sights of rain forest and waterfalls. Our tour guide knew the best spots to stop along the way for picture taking. As the road is very narrow and windy I was happy for someone else to do the hard driving.
Margherita L|77FD1A3AEB3AC5563A82C504932AAE27|Hotel|Las Vegas: Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino|2| “Not good value”|review_268421070|As an international visitor to Las Vegas for the first time PH did not offer us value for money! They even charged us an extra fee for arriving 2 hours before check in time. No consideration for having travelled a long distance to get there. They obviously don't expect us to come back so why bother giving us the basic amenities a hotel room should provide. Our room cost us $400AUD a night and we didn't get free wi-fi. No fridge (they wanted extra for that!) and NO tea/coffee provided in the room. If we were to go back to LV we will stay at one of the hotels at Fremont St for a quarter of the price. The only good points PH can provide is that the bed was comfortable and the shower was hot.

As an international visitor to Las Vegas it was very informative to learn the history of Fremont St/Las Vegas. Our guide was knowledgeable and gave us tips on where to eat. We went to one of his recommendations for pizza and pasta. It was excellent and by far the best meal we had in Las Vegas. The strip is overrated and expensive to eat! If I ever came back to LV I would stay at one of the hotels in Fremont St.

Highly recommend this walking tour. Eric our guide was fantastic. Very knowledgeable about the history of Griffith Park and LA which was so interesting as you walked along. Although you can walk the trails on your own it is so interesting to learn the history and facts of this Park.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Adelaide: Luigi Delicatessen|4| “Lovely Outdoor Meal”|review_475196261|Enjoyed my experience at Luigi's for lunch in the city. This place is pretty popular and when we arrived the inside tables were full so staff pulled a couple of tables together and we sat outside under the umbrellas - very enjoyable on a beautiful sunny day. Luigi sat with us and went through the menu including any special requirements. It's a pretty flexible menu but there are the main stay pasta items including carbonara etc. The crab is the most popular and a couple of people ordered that on our table and were not disappointed or you could go for the octopus if preferred. I had a great quinoa salad with prawns, pumpkin, cranberries etc which was delicious. Expect to pay about $30 with a drink for a main course.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Adelaide: Zenhouse Vegetarian Yum Cha|3| “Average Lunch”|review_472011255|I was disappointed with my lunchtime experience at Zenhouse. There were only half a dozen tables full of people but food only came out one meal at a time for tables and I waited 20 minutes for my stir fry vegies which seemed quite a long time. It was also bland and watery. Also while I was there other customers were complaining about not receiving their meals, while others at their table had finished theirs, meals received without accompaniments (sauces) and one person even had a complaint about dirty cutlery so not great. Would be reluctant to return.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Singapore: SweetSpot|4| “Beautiful Cafe”|review_471337451|The cakes and pastries available here are divine and reasonably priced to have with your coffee and the choices are endless. The service could be improved as all sales must go through a centralised spot even though you are originally served by another attendant - found this a bit bizarre and a little slow. Also the stools are really uncomfortable and we quickly moved onto the Rise Lounge which was way better.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Hotel|Singapore: The Fullerton Hotel Singapore|5| “Stroll through the Fullerton”|review_471334890|You don't have to stay at the Fullerton Hotel to enjoy the ambience of this beautiful place. We took a leisurely stroll through the foyer and lower floors just to simply enjoy the space and take a few photos on the sweeping staircase leading down to the fountain and lower floors that contain the Ballroom and other function areas. Walk through to the MRT from here. Next visit will definitely include a few nights accommodation at this wonderful venue.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Singapore: Marina Bay Sands Skypark|3| “Disappointing.......”|review_471333465|We have visited previously but our friends hadn't been up to the Observation Deck so up we went again. The price at $20 - $23 SGD is ok but the available space seems to have diminished since our last visit and you can now barely view the infinity pool at all. It was also very hot the day we were there and there is little relief from the blazing sun up there. We also visited at night previously and had dinner in the restaurant which was wonderful, and would recommend visiting at night rather than during the day.Also, the photos taken when you enter the Observation Deck are ridiculously expensive at about $50. Really !!
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Singapore: District 10 Bar & Restaurant|4| “Great Eatery”|review_471321628|This was our 'go to' restaurant in Singapore and we visited on three occasions. It was close to our accommodation, reasonably priced and the meals and service were very good. Diners can choose from the set menu option or a la carte. There was also the 2 for 1 drink option available during Happy Hour. The weekend menu is different from week days and is more informal with the sweet potato chips and club sandwiches a favourite. We went for breakfast on our final day in Singapore and found the place only opened at 11.30am so this became brunch. Not a problem.Service was very good and staff remembered us and even my special requirements when we visited the second time.A good experience and not typical for this type of franchise food outlet. Would recommend.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Singapore: Battlebox|5| “Thoroughly Enjoyable”|review_471318530|We were looking for a WWII tour that provided the historical background of Singapore and elected to visit Fort Canning. A Tour of the Battlebox, the command centre for Singapore, was about to commence so we joined in. We were not disappointed and found the tour very informative and learnt many important points about the surrender of Singapore on 15 February 1942. The tour guide, Kamaliah, was very professional and knowledgeable and she explained that a new company had taken over the renovation and upkeep of the Battlebox in 2016.We took the 'Story of Strategy and Surrender' tour and had the circumstances behind the Japanese invasion and subsequent surrender of Singapore by the British explained to us. There were many details that we were not aware of including the valiant defence of the vital NW coast of Singapore by the Australian 8th Division against the far superior Japanese forces led by the infamous General Yamashita. Would recommend this tour followed by a walk around the grounds if you get time. There is a new MTR station being built at Fort Canning which will make it easier to take public transport to this location in the future.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Singapore: Supply and Demand|3| “Mixed Experience”|review_471311424|We arrived for dinner on a Friday night and the restaurant was very busy. Unfortunately the level of service suffered due to this and staff apologised as the wait for our meals was lengthy. Also I ordered the pumpkin risotto and it had such a heavy garlic flavour and an unpleasant consistency that I couldn't eat it and we were not charged. In fairness the other meals ordered by our group including the marinara, and the fish of the day were fine - I might have been unlucky.Anyway, maybe try and avoid the busy times at this restaurant.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Singapore: Brunetti|4| “Touch of Italy on Tanglin”|review_471211248|If you are looking for a quick and easy lunch on Tanglin Road then I would recommend Brunettis. They do a pretty brisk trade as this area is popular with ex-pats and locals alike. The Italian menu has many choices and serves are generous. We shared our meals. There are also a multitude of delicious sweets to complete the meal including macaroons. Coffee is good as is the service. They do offer a catering service as well if interested. It's worth dropping in for a coffee and a look through the special cake selections on display. Wow !
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Singapore: The Chamber Bar & Bistro|3| “Quick Meal”|review_470690700|We visited here for a quick meal and drink for $29.90 set menu one night as we were staying in the area. The guys in our group had the ribs which were ok but others tried the barramundi which was a very thin slice of some kind of fish not sure it was as advertised. The service and location was quite nice so not all bad. OK for a quick meal.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Singapore: Chinatown Street Market|4| “Worth a Wander”|review_470688471|Yes, in a lot of ways, Chinatown is the usual Street Market experience but if you are looking for that 'little something' to take back home then this is the place to visit. There is the usual array of lightweight clothing available including a few stalls where clothing can be made for you, different types of bags, and other Singapore-specific souvenirs. We also had quite a reasonable meal in Smith Street but I would recommend that people have a good look at the meals being served before ordering as there is quite a contrast available. Beer specials are widely available.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Hotel|Singapore: Fraser Place Robertson Walk, Singapore|3| “Mixed Bag”|review_470471610|We booked a 2-bedroom apartment to share with another couple and found the common areas and second-bedroom quite small - would probably have suited a family rather than 2 couples. However, we unpacked and settled in. The following morning we found water dripping from the ceiling in the kitchen and found out that our water heater had literally rusted out and could not be used. We were advised that we would need to change rooms and were allocated the same room on another floor. However, I rang Reception and asked if we could possibly upgrade to a 3-bedroom apartment given the inconvenience - this was agreed after a number of conversations and was very much appreciated.I must state that both rooms were really in need of an update particularly the wet areas that appeared to have experienced serious mould problems that had been treated by covering with silicone - not that great for a 4.5 star apartment complex. The location is fabulous within close proximity of Clarke Quay, many restaurants and a quick taxi ride to most areas within the city of Singapore. The shuttle service to Orchard Road, Bugis Junction and other key locations is also well served. Unfortunately the Hub where breakfast is served was being upgraded when we visited (we were not advised) which meant breakfast was served in the lobby. This was not really a problem as we were encouraged to take our brekkie back to our room. We went to the pool where the tables were bigger and had our breakfasts there most mornings. The pool area was lovely and was very popular.Service was very good and staff were most helpful but the apartments (unless we stayed in the older section) are in real need of updating. This is a shame given the great location and very helpful staff. It would be well worth upgrading the apartments and we would be happy to stay again if this occurred.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Singapore: Lau Pa Sat|4| “Busy Lunchtime Venue”|review_470464266|We arrived at the Lau Pa Sat Hawker Centre right on lunchtime and found it difficult to get a table for 4 as it was extremely busy and filled with office workers from the surrounding financial district offices but we persevered and were rewarded with cheap and delicious food. We tried the Hainanese chicken rice, laksa, along with other Singaporean favourites. We were searching for satays but later found that satay street opens after 7pm. Would recommend avoiding the lunchtime rush if you are a tourist but overall a pleasant experience.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Singapore: Shabestan|4| “Enjoyable Persian Experience”|review_470462397|We were staying close by to the Shabestan Persian Restaurant, Robertson Quay, and whenever we walked by this restaurant it was always pretty full. We found the food very enjoyable and a meat-lover's paradise with lamb a standout. Sumac spice was served with our meal and was a lovely addition, as was the rice bread. The service was very good and our waitress provided assistance when working our way through the extensive menu.There is seating available outside or inside in the air conditioning. It is at the pricey end of the scale but we were looking for a special restaurant on that particular night and were not disappointed. Interestingly there are a couple of further cafes/restaurants owned by the family located at Ngee Ann City (PITA Tree) and at ION Orchard (Tazeh) if you are not close to Robertson Quay. Each location has it's own menu. Definitely worth a try.

It is very easy to catch the MRT to VivoCity Shopping Centre and the monorail out to Sentosa. We were amazed at the choice of rides, shows, shops and events to visit at Universal Studios. We found there was something to see in each section of the Park and thoroughly enjoyed the day. Would recommend the Waterworld Show and the Transformers Ride. Enjoy !
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Singapore: Cloud Forest|4| “Waterfall Wonder”|review_470456481|It is definitely worthwhile working your way up to the top of the waterfall to observe the lush greenery and flowers on the descent back to ground level. Everything is very well done and includes walkways out over the gardens, spray from the waterfall and life-like sculptures throughout. Lovely and cool on a hot day !
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Singapore: Flower Dome|5| “Beautiful to Behold”|review_470454505|We were truly inspired by the beautiful Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay. We visited during the Blossom Bliss event and were transported to Japan during the cherry blossom season with over 20 different types of blossoms on display located in a Japanese landscape. Amazing ! There were many other beautiful sights to behold including the wooden sculptures strategically located throughout the dome.This is one of the most beautiful displays I have ever seen and everything on display is absolutely pristine.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Singapore: OCBC Skyway|4| “Exciting Walkway”|review_470452975|The walk amongst the top of the Supertrees is worthwhile. Even though you only have 15mins there are plenty of photo opportunities and the view over the park and the skyline is amazing. The Skyway is open between 9.00am and 9.00pm daily so if you want to get that evening view you can certainly do so.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Singapore: Gardens by the Bay|5| “Amazing Place”|review_470452253|When we last visited Gardens by the Bay it had just opened and it was great to see how much further the site had progressed since that time. This is a fabulous location and now has a very child-friendly and interactive space within the garden area.From the Marina Bay Sands crossing and vantage point to the Supertree Grove and OCBC Skyway, Flower Dome and Cloud Forest as well as the outdoor garden areas there is plenty to visit at this site. We bought tickets for both conservatories and received discount as we had travelled with Singapore Airlines and still had our boarding passes (10%). There was an amazing cherry-blossom display set in a Japanese landscape when we visited the Flower Dome and it was truly beautiful. This is only the second time Gardens at the Bay have held this event but it is one to watch out for in the future.The only problem in visiting the Gardens is that there is so much to see and one day is not enough time.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Singapore: Bar & Billiard Room|4| “A 'Must Do' Visit”|review_470450699|Even though Raffles is undergoing major renovations it was worth stopping by to have the mandatory Singapore Sling, this time in the Billiard Room, in lieu of the Long Bar. Be prepared to pay AUD$35 for each drink and peanut nibbles. I am also informed that the Singapore Slings may not be made fresh as the venue needs to be able to move visitors along reasonably quickly but, nevertheless if you incorporate a walk around the grounds to admire the lovely raffles-style architecture that make it so popular around the world it is still a worthwhile visit.Would recommend trying cocktails at the Rise Lounge, Marina Bay Sands, where you can purchase a fresh and fantastic Singapore Sling in a huge balloon glass for $20.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Singapore: Sand Bar Sentosa|4| “Natural Beach Cafe and Bar”|review_470442543|We visited Sentosa Island and were about to embark on a stroll along the beachfront when a thunderstorm rolled in and the beach was cleared. We took refuge at the Sand Bar / Flame Cafe and ordered cocktails which were very peasant. It is located on the edge of Siloso beach not far from the chairlift. A basic food menu is available including burgers, kebabs and roast chicken and there is a cocktail bar along side - brilliant. Staff continued to serve customers throughout the downpour as quite a crowd developed. It was evident that this was a common occurrence and nobody was pressured to move on until the storm passed. Thank you for your hospitality and great cocktails.

It is easy to find your way around and add $ to cards at the numerous stations without any assistance. Many places in the world could learn a thing or two from Singapore. I didn't feel unsafe using the MRT either at any time.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Singapore: Renn Thai|4| “Reliable Thai Food”|review_470440206|This is a great reliable place to have Thai at Clarke Quay overlooking the river. It is inexpensive and has a number of drink offers to go with your meals: 2 for 1 or jugs of beer. If you do not like too much spicy flavour watch out for the dry chilli flakes that come with a number of the dishes (even in the chicken and cashew dish), suggest you ask for mild spices. Service was a good standard. Lovely outlook.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Adelaide: Sq Restaurant & Lounge Bar|4| “Friendly and Accommodating”|review_467665979|A group of us had a work lunch at SQ in the city and found the food and service ideal for the occasion. The staff were aware that we were time restricted and had our meals available quickly advising us that they were expecting a large table shortly. This was appreciated and we were in an out in under an hour. Most of us chose the Lean and Green menu which consists of a main meal and a glass of wine or soft drink for $19.90. The crispy salmon was probably the No 1 selection. Very good service by the wait staff and meals can be paid for separately as you leave.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Semaphore: Lickerish|4| “Fabulous Outlook”|review_467663963|We ventured down to Semaphore on a sunny Sunday afternoon and were not disappointed by the setting for our lunch on the balcony at Lickerish with a lovely sea view. We enjoyed our meals which were mostly from the larger meals Specials board but, in retrospect, we probably should have chosen a number of the smaller meals from their tapas type menus and shared. The chicken wings are totally scrumptious. It was a very relaxed environment and staff are happy to accommodate you. Parking was ridiculous but we just moved our car as we ran over the 2 hours parking limit. Would definitely return again.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Norwood: Stone's Throw|5| “Fabulous Flavours”|review_458156706|Loved the layers of flavours in all the dishes we tried at Stone's Throw. Every dish was an adventure ! The menu is not extensive but our waiter was very knowledgeable about each dish and how best to share - this is the preferred option. Menu is divided into small and large dishes and large is more than one person can comfortably consume. There is also the sharing set menu which is worth asking about if interested but I would suggest that this would suit a larger group of people.The only negative is that once the dining room is full it is extremely noisy as sound echos in the open space. I could barely hear from across the table and would prefer to eat outside next time. Fortunately we had our meal early so subsequently left early and it wasn't really a problem for us. We have already booked for another dinner.

We will return.

It is a relaxing and peaceful place to visit whether on a drizzly wet day or a 40 degree day. You can't got to the gardens without visiting the Amazon waterlily pavilion, cactus and succulent garden and a walk down Murdoch Avenue and, of course, a visit to the Bicentennial Conservatory just to name a few of the areas. There are guided-walks daily provided by very well-informed guides. Great place to visit if you have an hour or two free.

This is a great space and location on the cnr of KW Street and North Terrace with terrific views. There are lots of comfy spots to sit and take in that view. I've visited many times and it does get packed up there but we were lucky this time. We were met by very friendly staff and enjoyed the experience, other venues should learn from K2W in Adelaide!
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Adelaide: Cocolat|4| “Good for a Cuppa”|review_447936482|I acknowledge that this isn't the cheapest place to grab a coffee and cake but it is well located on Rundle Street nestled between the boutiques so high prices aren't unexpected. There is a choice of sitting outside at either end of the cafe as inside does tend to be quite dark but comfortable nonetheless. The macaroons are of good quality and a favourite of mine but there are plenty of choices ranging from the award winning gelati to the truffles and speciality chocolate of course. Service was excellent too when we visited but the cafe was relatively quiet.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Adelaide: Redsalt|3| “Expected More”|review_447934657|We had interstate visitors over for Christmas and we were really looking forward to our dinner at Redsalt. It was Christmas Eve and the restaurant wasn't overly busy. We ordered and waited over 60mins for our main course. Everyone, except me (I ordered the Barramundi which was a mushy consistency), commented that the food was delicious. However, there were several issues eg the lamb was not a rack of lamb as advertised and they had run out of pork. Redsalt doesn't offer an extensive menu so would be professional if everything advertised was available. We decided to share desserts and ordered the chocolate indulgence and the panna cotta. We waited another 30mins. There was confusion about whether they had any panna cotta; no they didn't, yes they did but it arrived with the other desserts. Once again, the actual food was lovely but the service just doesn't match and we were offered free desserts as the poor service was recognised by the maitre d. Unfortunately the whole experience was rather embarrassing and we won't be returning in a hurry.

It is clean, service is reliable and there is a solid range of food and beverages offered including locally brewed craft beers. Would recommend a try next time you visit Brisbane Airport.

There is also a choice of sitting outside or inside if the weather is warm. We ordered a couple of the special atlantic salmon and of course the calamari dish. All meals were very good and more than adequate. A bottle of wine is also reasonable. A good choice for a family lunch at what can be an expensive place to visit.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Mount Cotton: Sirromet Wines|5| “Lovely surprise”|review_442239577|We were visiting relatives in Mt Cotton and went along to Sirromet Wines for a wine tasting afternoon. It happened to be the same day as the Day on the Green event at the winery. We went to the restaurant first which was fully booked and were re-directed to the cafe where food and wines were available on the day. The lovely young man advised if we wanted to return to the restaurant we could do some wine tasting in a side room next to the restaurant - very accommodating we thought. We found a table outside, ordered some lovely wine and a generous cheese platter. Perfect ! In addition we had music from the concert wafting up from the Green - it was a thoroughly delightful afternoon.Would love to return and try the restaurant next time.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Amsterdam: Amsterdam Canal Cruises|4| “Must Do Experience”|review_432794817|An Amsterdam Canal Cruise is a must as it provides a unique perspective of the city that can't be provided by any other transportation. There are so many choices so important to do your research first to ensure that you are going with a reputable provider. Our canal tour was part of our cruise but still included the rather monotonous tour description over the plastic ear plugs but still good background information. Thoroughly enjoyed the trip along the Herengracht and Prinsengracht that included Anna Frank's old home as well as a view of some very expensive canal front homes. There are also some very interesting sights along the canals of how people in Amsterdam live on the water that you cannot appreciate from the street view. Worthwhile just cruising along the canals under some of the over 1500 bridges in the city and having a look at the interesting architecture including art deco and art nouveau building of the 1920s. Just sit back and enjoy.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Gothenburg: Volvo Museum|4| “More than Just Cars”|review_432792486|I reluctantly joined my husband on a visit to the Volvo Museum but was glad I did ! This Museum not only includes the history of the Volvo cars, trucks and buses and green energy over the year that one would expect but much, much more. There is a whole section on the Volvo Ocean Racing team which is interactive and provides a real insight into racing on the high seas, there is the world largest Lego car and even the SAAB Viggen aircraft. There is also a cafe which provides excellent internet coverage. A great rainy day excursion.

There is a permanent display which includes artefacts from the Middle Ages and it is interesting to know that the Museum has been built over buildings dating from the 1100s. When we visited there was a rune exhibition on display which illustrated how these signs were used to communicate in bygone days and there was also a fabulous display on the 1916 Bergen fire. There is a small cafe on Level 1 and the Wi-fi was very good.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Bergen: Johanneskirken|4| “Great View of Bergen”|review_405123205|It is worth a walk up to Johanneskirken for the view from the top of the stairs. The Church itself is simple in design and when we visited there was a service underway. It appeared to be a popular local attraction. The interior is quite vast with seating for over 1200 people and the central light is a unique design of chandelier.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Bergen: Bryggen Hanseatic Wharf|4| “Definitely Worth a Look”|review_405120264|This is a lovely area to walk around and enjoy the 2nd largest city in Norway, it is very quaint and unique with its leaning wooden buildings on the main streetscape. Just wandering the backstreets and walking through the lovely shops showing off their handmade lacework, leather goods etc on a beautiful sunny afternoon is something I will always remember. You can also grab a fresh seafood paella or even try whale meat if you are so inclined at the local market.

It is a beautiful walk on very safe stairs so all you need to do is decide where to start and finish. Some areas are in the spray of the cascading water which only adds to the experience. Give it a go !
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Geiranger: Norsk Fjordsenter|5| “Very Enjoyable”|review_405115995|We visited the Norsk Fjordsenter as part of the Hop On Hop Off bus trip around Geiranger. This is a very informative centre which provides a look back in time with interactive displays as well as a 3D movie experience which demonstrates the beautiful local scenery. There is a nice cafe and quite a good gift shop on site as well. Also the waterfall walk from the Centre is definitely worth doing, the sheer power of the water is unbelievable and it is a comfortable walk back down to the wharf area. Beautiful !
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Geiranger: Geiranger Fjord|5| “Stunning”|review_405114427|We visited Geiranger Fjord as part of a cruise and were wowed by the beautiful scenery. It was very special and we were fortunate to have the loveliest weather as well. It was definitely a once in a lifetime experience to visit the Fjords of Norway.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Eidfjord: Eidfjord Church|4| “Historical Church”|review_405112287|The Church built in 1309 is decorated to reflect how it would have looked in the 18th Century and is only used for special occasions now. Apparently families had their names carved at the end of the rows to indicate their allocated pews. The cemetery is also worth strolling through and is well maintained with seating provided. It was a very peaceful experience.

You can walk up the 418 steps or catch the cute little train which drives through the pretty streets of the town. You have a panoramic view from the mountain top of Alesund below and across the archipelago to the Sunnmore Alps. There is also a cafe at the top so you can recharge before tackling the 418 steps on the way down.

The beautifully restored rooms of the Pharmacy are gorgeous with stained glass windows and other lovely interiors on display including the fabulous dining room. There is also the time machine which provides the Alesund history from when the majority of the town was burnt down in 1904 and how it was rebuilt in the art nouveau style which was very popular at the time. There are many beautiful buildings around the town which also display this beautiful architectural style and well worth visiting
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Attractions|Emirates|3| “Room for Improvement”|review_401902080|We have flown the Adelaide to Dubai and return with Emirates a number of times now and will be very reluctant to ever undertake this again on the 777-300ER that services this route. The aircraft is cramped, noisy and downright uncomfortable in economy class. We seriously thought about upgrading to Business Class on the return journey but for the cost we would expect something better than what is offered - basically a narrow, sloping seat to sleep on ie a slopebed. We decided it wasn't worth it. Also when we asked staff in Dubai about upgrading they were not very helpful. There were no complaints about the service provided onboard. Recommend looking for alternatives flying out of Adelaide - that's what we will be doing next time.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Hotel|Copenhagen: Andersen Boutique Hotel|5| “Comfortable Hotel”|review_393364950|We booked a Junior Suite and found the size of the room quite comfortable for European standards for the two of us, although I personally wouldn't want to go any smaller. I requested a room on the upper floors and we ended up on the top floor which we enjoyed very much as we could open our windows and enjoy the breeze at night. We had a street-facing room and we were not affected by any noise at night.The service at the Hotel is of a high standard and it was lovely to meet other guests at the Happy Hour each night and share our travel stories. There was a variety of travellers staying at the Andersen of all ages from across the globe. Breakfast offers a range of goodies buffet-style on the ground floor, that would suit most discerning guests and, if there was a special request, the staff were only too happy to oblige if at all possible. The location is great and within easy walking distance of the station with our suitcases. The surrounding area is interesting with the addition of 'working girls' on corners around the Hotel at night but it was not a problem at all.There are many restaurants within easy walking distance of the Andersen as is Nyhavn, Tivoli Gardens and the Tourist Office. As sunset this time of year is about 11pm there is still plenty of daylight hours for getting around safely at night.Great decor tops off this lovely, friendly, modern boutique-style Hotel.I would highly recommend when in Copenhagen.
SpecialBirthday|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|Restaurant|Copenhagen: Restaurant Karla|4| “Great spot for Lunch”|review_393360613|We came across this Restaurant located in Dantes Plads just behind Tivoli Gardens when returning to our Hotel from visiting Christiansborg Palace. It was a beautiful sunny day and we decided to grab a table outside - inside tables are also available. There is a large choice of good hearty food on the menu including burgers which seemed popular but there are also salads and sandwiches available. The location is convenient to many attractions and the service and cost of meals is very reasonable.

The food was fabulous, the service pitched just right and the ambience of the venue lovely. Each course was presented with an explanation from the attentive owner. This restaurant is so popular that the only booking we could get in the week we were in Copenhagen was at 5.30pm but it was worth it !! Excellent !!

We sat outside at one of the many tables with umbrellas as the weather was sunny. Seats are also available inside. Very well organised and reasonably prices cafe.

I can't say enough of Mexicano except this is the best food and I keep looking forward to it from chicken cheese nachos, pinchos, fish tacos, chimichanga to the long island ice teas, sangarias etc. I must say the staff is exceptional and everytime I'm there I get a service like a VIP, it's not just me it's everybody! It goes to show the people hired are well trained and know how to handle extra crowded place like it was on this Saturday night for Mothers night in Bangkok.The band is even more amazing than before with the best version of Bilando version and even Despacito (original version without justin) hahaI'm a regular and because of the service I'll keep coming back!

This time round I tried the Lamb Gnocchi in main course, which was the best I've had so far (even better than in Italy). Eduardo is an excellent chef and with the guidance of Gulio this place is one of the best Italian restaurant in Bangkok and a must try place for everyone. The wine list is amazing and Gulios recommendation is always bang on!Will be back again very soon.

The owner is very friendly and showed real passion for food with his cooking. From starters to pizza, to mains (I had lamb) was cooked to perfection with excellent flavors. Would just like to see more stocks of same wines, as we weren't able to order the same wine and had to manage with 4 different wine bottle.I'll be back again to try other other things on the menu soon.

The drinks were good and so was the atmosphere. Made a quite a few friends who were fellow travellers. Excellent place to start your evening for drinks.A must visit when in Athens.
Threefingered|552DAF0FE794187F4A3C549844CC2C26|Attractions|Barcelona: Las Ramblas|5| “A place for everyone”|review_486349517|The feeling and liveliness you get to feel at Las Ramblas is second to none. The place is a must visit while in Barcelona. The restaurants with their promotions of set starters, paella and wines or beers is a must. Though, everyone take care of your belongings as we heard a few people being pickpocketed.
Threefingered|552DAF0FE794187F4A3C549844CC2C26|Hotel|Athens: The Athens Gate Hotel|5| “Excellent view and top floor restaurant”|review_486348750|We were checked in by Vasilis whose a friendly person and he also guided us on directions perfectly. We chose this hotel to stay at because of their claims of the view of the temple of Zues and Acropolis and indeed it did, especially at breakfast on the rooftop. My wife and I enjoyed the views so much that we even spent our dinner time there.During drinks and dinner time our server was Aris. The wine bottle we ordered was exceptional and worth the 50 odd euros it costed. Though, I must say I think Aris was in some sort of a hurry, because we had just started drinking our wine and he kept coming back thrice to ask us if we were ready to order our starters and the again for the main course. We initially thought of having 2 bottle but were all done with dinner just after 1 so we decided to change the place.The breakfast every morning was excellent. Though, it's not huge array, the spread is good enough and the taste and flavours were bang on.I think this hotel lives up to its description on website and TA. An excellent place to stay in Athens.

From staters of mix dips to salads to the main with meat, everything was very tasty. Our server Sotos was friendly and attentive too. Though, I was told the house wine is very good and it didn't live up to it as it tasted like water more than a wine.Other than that it's a good place in the center of Plaka and with nice ambience with outside seating.
Threefingered|552DAF0FE794187F4A3C549844CC2C26|Restaurant|Rome: Pasqualino al Colosseo|3| “Good food and wine but service is bad”|review_485355232|Being near to our hotel one night we decided to drop by for a dinner here. We ordered a wine bottle between my wife and I but from being seated to ordering a wine it literally took us 15 mins just to get the attention of the staff. There was only 1 other table so the place was empty. Anyhow, we continued to place our orders from starters to mains all were made well, so was the neapolitan pizza. The bread served before our food started coming in was stale and had that come before our order being placed I would have immediately left.This place has the potential but just needs to improve their breads and service.

We were checked in by Sergio whose extremely friendly and professional and just an amazing human being in my opinion. After a good nights sleep in comfortable beds we went to the roof top for breakfast and voila there is the colosseum!!! Awesome view...then came along Manmun to set our table (which he did everyday with a smile) with the view of the colosseum. Manmun again was very efficient and served us always with a smile along with Luigi who didn't speak much English but we could tell he was very welcoming and warm as well.The gym is made quite well too, for a boutique hotel I must say.My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at the hotel with the 3 warmest of staff I mentioned above and for that very reason I'm looking forward to coming to Roma soon and stay at this hotel again!By the way Sergio, I hope you've quit smoking by now hahaha....

Our server Oskar was quite friendly and even spoke a bit of other languages to our surprise. The food along with pizza was decent. The beer was chilled and that was a plus with the amazing feeling of sitting right on grand canal which was priceless.

We were excited because we really were looking forward to all the activities we wanted to do, but sadly the weather was extreme and snowfall was a lot. We only got to the top by cable car and it was foggy and didn't really enjoy it as much as we thought we would. But weather is not the fault of the establishment and all I can say is I will certainly be back soon in a warmer month to enjoy all the rides!

We were checked in by Sarina whom my wife and I can't say enough about. She was the most courteous, friendly and at the same time professional employee we came across so far. My wife even said our check-in was the best in the world so far (and we've travelled a lot). Another person very helpful to me was Christoph who really got me out of a jam when I needed to send an urgent attachment by email to a customer.Breakfast at the hotel is amazing, from salmon to nutella everything we wanted was there so it a must.To me what makes a hotel extra special are the people working there, and I'm sure I'll only be staying her on every visit of mine to Zurich.

The service was inattentive and were showing themselves to be more busy than they were. But for romantic drinks and view of the Eiffel Tower, this place is perfect.On our second visit we only had drinks and no food.
Threefingered|552DAF0FE794187F4A3C549844CC2C26|Hotel|Paris: Melia Paris Tour Eiffel|3| “Excellent location but noisy rooms”|review_483572062|Firstly, the location is excellent and just a few steps from Eiffel Tower (literally). We were checked in by Miguel whose very friendly and polite. The room was a bit tiny but that's expected with a hotel that has an amazing location in the city but we couldn't get a good night sleep because there is no sound proofing in the rooms and the whole night we could hear people walking, talking and doors closing which was very annoying. Though, the beds were very comfortable I must admit.Jayath, served us well too.On our departure we were told on reception by 2 ladies that a taxi to CDG airport would cost a fix price of 57 euros if we called it in through the hotel and we did, but on our arrival at the airport the taxi driver asked for 67 euros onto which I told the driver of 57 but the driver didn't agree. I think when a taxi is called in through the hotel it would be best if hotel speaks to them in advance of price and inform the customer in front of the driver of the price for transparency (just a suggestion).

The server Akhtar Pervez for some reason was a bit uptight before we ordered the wine bottle (which was highly overpriced) and then started serving us as he should have to begin with. The food is far from authentic Spanish food we became accustomed to. The staff along with cooks are from Pakistan and don't think they have quite grabbed onto the Spanish flavours yet. The only thing good was the seating outside.We did not return and I won't recommend for anyone to eat here.
Threefingered|552DAF0FE794187F4A3C549844CC2C26|Restaurant|Barcelona: Navia Restaurant|5| “Excellent food and prices”|review_483569277|We visted Navia twice on our stay in Barcelona. Though, the place was out of our way we still were very happy to find this place while walking around. The Gambas were the best I've had till now. It was even better than other places we tried in La Ramblas. The octopus and seafood paella were excellent and fresh too. The wine bottles are reasonably priced and so are the beers.The young female staff with glasses was very attentive and friendly.
Threefingered|552DAF0FE794187F4A3C549844CC2C26|Hotel|Barcelona: Pullman Barcelona Skipper|5| “Excellent hotel, location and service”|review_483568114|My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Pullman, it being on the beach was a big plus. Las Ramblas is quite a walk even though it goes through the marina; however, there is a metro very close by which can take you there. Even though no one stood out, the staff overall was friendly and attentive always.A good place to stay.

The place is made very well and the adult rides are quite thrilling and exhilarating.The most enjoyable for me was the Cylon.Don't forget to take the priority pass for bit extra so that you won't have wait in lines much.We will be back soon.

Though, the peri peri fries are not as Nando's around the world serves because the fries were not coated with the spice well rather the spice was merely sprinkled on the fries but chicken is just as good as it is everywhere.I must point out the service we received from Din at this branch was exceptional. He's a very professional and polite person. I preferred coming to this branch instead of orchard road just because of him.

Our room on the 19th floor was very comfortable and the amenities were perfect and we didn't feel anything was missing. Even though the TV didn't have any music channels for that they had a music system with preset channels.At the concierge there's Mike whose again very knowledgeable and polite. Though I didn't need my usual assistance like I do in many hotels from concierge, I knew if I did Mike would have been upto the task.The beds and pillows were very comfortable, though, the quilt at times was too warm but we managed fine.For the location, I think this hotel has great location as its located in Marina Bay is stone throw away from all Marina Bay tourist attractions. Just underneath the hotel is raffles which consists of many restaurants and supermarket which are open till 11 pm. I really enjoyed my stay in Singapore Fairmont and will certainly come and stay again.

I've always enjoyed my visits to Buritara since years and I did so this time round too. Our server K.Beer was very attentive. Though, I miss the old menu with international cuisine but still the thai food served is very good.

Starters were Bhatti da murg which was just ok and mutton seekh kebab which was good. Butter chicken and kadhai murgh were mediocre and dal makhni was good especially after adding the cheese garlic cream given with papads. Breads were good.Overall the food was mediocre and my opinion on it is nowhere as other reviewers to say the least. The service though is good with our wait staff Pandey and others being quite attentive.The one thing I really disliked is that we were really unable to enjoy the food because of mosquitoes. We even told the waiters a few times but knew they were unable to do anything about it. This made the evening very uncomfortable as everyone was being bitten and we could not enjoy the live band long enough and had to finish our food and leave asap. I won't come back to try other dishes thanks to the mosquitoes.

The place is made well and the staff is quite polite. However, the food is mediocre. The only decent dish was jalapeño poppers. Everything else we ordered wasn't upto the tex mex style from habenero prawns to chimichanga. Portions of the guacamole is very small, though the chips were plenty and tasty. We had to order extra guacamole, salsa, sour cream etc with main dishes such as buritos. The sour cream isn't good tasting, better if they would purchase and serve gourmet or villa sour cream, than making their own. Even though price isn't an issue but I must say the food isn't worth the prices.Pool table wasn't free as I was informed by the staff that I will have to pay 20 baht. I asked before even ordering the food so didn't even bother playing. Parking is available but it isn't free either and restaurant doesn't validate.I won't be coming back because there are many better places in Bangkok for Mexican food.

The food is really good from butter chicken burgers to drinks. Especially enjoyed the buckets of hoegaardens and banta vodka bottles. Our server Randeep was efficient but at times had his hands full, so, I requested Arush to bring us 4 quater plates as we were in the middle of our meal and I literally saw Arush go towards the till and just stand there. I mean seriously!!! If you don't want to serve us that's fine at least ask someone else to do a job you think you're not upto doing like getting empty plates! I confronted him on my way out on the same and he wasn't even apologetic.Except that the whole night was great. We will be back.

The food was just as it is internationally at Jamie's except for the chicken dish in the main course which I enjoyed so much that I had 2 of the same for main. For starters we ordered the crab and avocado bruschetta which was just ok, the tomato bruschetta which cheese is much better. The fried squid was excellent. Missus ordered the prawns spaghetti which was made well too. The wine bottle we ordered was delicious (pic attached). Service was good but a little less attentive which I'm sure will improve as it gets some months under its belt.We will be back soon.

We were checked in by Manisha, the checkin was quite swift. We were alloted rooms 1406 & 1407. The rooms had city and pool view as stated (however, the pool view was quite depressing). The beds and pillows were very comfortable for a good night sleep, and the bathrooms were big. As we drove there I did notice that the people at main gate to the valet were all very friendly to say the least. The staff at the long bar on 1st floor were good too. However, I must say the bar needs more variety of drinks especially in beer.Overall, a good stay and will certainly stay here again on my next trip to Gurugram.

For me the bruschetta actually stood out with their superb cheese on it. The drinks are good too and reasonably priced. The service is attentive and friendly. A good place to have a good lunch or dinner with family.The heating system outside is well placed and quite effective, we even took off our jackets and couldn't believe we were actually sitting outdoors.Will be back soon

Sure enough it's right now bosphorus which is spectacular. The food was good and the desert which was made of pistachio and served with ice cream was very tasty. A bill for 4 people at 300 talay was very reasonable.As I drove there, do note the valet service is provided right outside the restaurant at 15 talay which is a norm on the beach road. Though I do feel the valet driver could have been more careful while bringing my new bwm back to me. I could see he was driving quite rough and fast on the way back to give us the car.

My favourite till now is the Margarita pizza with buffalo cheese. The bruschetta is really good too on big pieces of bread, though it would be even better if cherry tomatoes were used instead of the bigger ones. Gnocchi though is just ok (tried it for the first time on one of our visits this time).The service is ok and still can improve quite a lot. The 2 people at the entrance smoking and no smoking downstairs are always good, but the waiters inside could be more polite for sure.Will come back soon.

However, with all the problems we had it was all overshadowed. First, the heating wasn't working in the room, called them and Abdullah came but was not able to fix it. So instead of changing our room, they kept 2 big heaters in our room. The same day we found that there is no hot water in the hotel. My wife and I got drenched in the rain while shopping all day and couldn't take a shower that night because of it and I started having a fever the next day because of it. The hot water came back on the next night!The next day morning there was no electricity in our room from 5 am till 10 am and we couldn't even call housekeeping or reception to check because telephones are powered by electricity. I honestly thought the whole hotel didn't have electricity but it turned out it was just our room. While leaving our room at 10 am I informed them and they said they will have it fixed before we got back to hotel after lunch and shopping and they did without informing us know why it happened. Well the same thing happened when within an hour hour of our return and then the engineer who came to check informed us that the power was tripping because of the heaters!! Really...I wasn't feeling well at all or else everyone would have got an earful from me. Good thing 3rd day we were leaving for our home to Prague and didn't have to stay there any longer. Worst thing is being a hilton instead of offering something (anything) like fruits for apology they gave a letter in every room which I've put up. Comeon!The manageress whom I had informed of all these problems before, came to apologize while they called me a taxi when we checked out, but the damage was done.It okay to have a few problem sometimes at hotels as we travel a lot and know, but it's how the hotel handles it matters. They did a bad job at handling it. really need to improve. The comfortable thing however of the hotel was their bed which gave me some rest during my fever.

We started off with a bottle of amazing wine FL. Vermentino which was recommended by Stephan and it was just as he said "excellent because it's from the same place he is". Luca was very accommodating and gave great recommendations for food. The most we enjoyed was the pumpkin soup and Lamb Gnocchi.

Started off with stash then to Kazbar and then finally thought of trying brew, beers & burger. Kris was an amazing person to deal with. He kept coming up to us everytime our food was ready and presented. We had 3 lamb burgers and 1 truffles fries. My limit to have non vegetarian was at 12am and Kris made sure I had my burger and finished it before 12 am (personal reasons). My wife and I kept ordering beer and ciders and yes they have all beers including weihenstephaner...my favorite. The place is laid back and chilled out. Went there and got what I was looking for. Awesome place and awesome atmosphere thanks to Kris whom I told I would write good word about.

We chose to sit outside and quite enjoyed the laid back chilled atmosphere. However, I do feel they need more selection of Ciders and beers, and BeerLao should actually be off the list, considering the place is looking for high end clientele.Overall a good place for drinks with friends and family.

The rooms are quite comfortable with comfortable beds and pillows. I specially liked the smaller pillow. Rooms service could be a tad bit faster as we had to wait for bottle openers for about 15 mins and that too they opened the bottles and took the opener back. It shouldn't be that way!The concierge service was very good by Thao who booked my E Class for a short trip. But the other person whose a bit older with glasses was again not polite. So I feel there is a mixer of staff that are service oriented and other that don't care.The breakfast was good and the best service we got was from An who remembered everyday to get us our hot chocolates.The rooftop bar is made well and we really enjoyed our happy hours from 11pm to 12:30 am.Definitely a hotel to stay at but if staff are trained more in being polite this place would be one of the best in HCM. I gave 4 stars just because of Vinh, Thao and An.

Making tables was really fast, saving so much time and sweaters in the hot and humid weather in Cambodia. Thai food should be more Thai (sour and spicy).Definitely come back if have chance.

There are a small pool in front of reception and people can relax here esp at night time which is quite windy and perfect in Cambodian humid hot weather.They offered a lovely welcome with pickup by car (I thought it would be a tuk tuk, but they wowed us by a car), drinks, and cold towels. The hostel offer free tuk tuk from 8AM - 10PM to town (night market) which was super convenient for us.Restaurant offered good food with quite reasonable price. And if a sunrise watch to Angkor is book, a takeaway breakfast will be prepared for you.A little minus point is wifi in room (316) is disconnected most of the time.

Got up at 4AM and reached the temple at 4.30PM for sunrise. The moment sitting in front of the Angkor Sunrise is the most beautiful one I could have in my life. The temple area is super big, so a tuk tuk or a bike is a must to hire. Should come early to the temple to avoid super hot and sunny weather during day time. Food inside the temple is not so good, and expensive, so should buy snacks in advance.Should book a tour or a personal tourguide, as this huge history cannt be covered in a self tour. Sunset is beautiful at Beakhang temple, but a limitation of first 300 people are allowed to climb up, so some early at arounf 3.30pm to reserve a slot for yourself.

The resort is not in Mui Ne center, so they can offer you beautiful private beach which you dont have to take any time and transportation to go to. Food mostly taste nice but dont take Pho, it's not original vietnamese Pho. they also have 1$ beverages menu. For sunset at Red Sand Dunes, city bus will take you there with a very cheap fare, about 4cents. Should go to the sunset at 5PM and wait till the golden time at 5.30PM. It's absolutely worth a visit.Tents right in front of the beach are fine, but will be a lot windy at night time so it may make your sleep not so good. Should take tents in the garden, still near the beach and calm at night for nice sleep.Cant be better.

We bought the tickets for the observation deck, went up, disappointed, came back down, paid the difference of RM49 and went back up to the open deck because that's where you can take a lot of photos, selfies and enjoy the view.

There is a kettle with 2 mugs but you are supposed to bring your own tea/coffee as it's not provided.There are no bell boys and you are supposed to carry your own luggage to your room.Though we reqested early check two weeks in advance they made us wait for four hours for the room.We booked this hotel as it was a highly rated hotel.I am writing this review sitting in a small coffee shop which provides free WiFi unlike Fave hotel. Would not recommended this hotel at all

My Scotch fillet was requested to be Rare and it was also overcooked and quite fatty . A big disappointment . Hopefully this was a one off as we are regular stayers at the Manor House . We did have a room service meal and this was excellent .

Quite inexpensive , we were picked up from our Hotel and driven to Chinatown where we joined a Bus to the Brewery . About 30 minutes on the Bus . We arrived at the Brewery where we were shown in to a reception area where we were given ID badges and given time to read about the Tiger brewery from the static displays in the Reception area , very interesting . Our Guide arrived and began by showing a short Video about how the Tiger Brewery was founded , very interesting . We then began the Tour , First we are shown all the ingredients that go into making Beer ,we then walk out between several buildings and up some stairs and into a large building where the Beer is brewing . Large stainless steel tanks full of beer . We then spent around 10 minutes outside where there are several displays including an original delivery truck . We then went into the "Bar" for around 35 minutes of Beer tasting (the best bit) .There is a Souvenir Shop on site . We then caught the Bus back to our Hotels . We felt there was not a lot of Touring through the whole Brewery , the Bottling process , or the beer being made , etc . Still worth a visit .

We also did not want anything too fancy . So we ordered the Wagyu Beef Burger with Chips on a Beet Bun each . They quoted 20 minutes delivery to our room but it was delivered in under 15 minutes . The Burgers were Huge. The Wagyu Beef pattie was absolutely delicious , so tender and tasty . The Bun was soft & moist with a purple colour from the Beet . The Chips were hot and crisp but fluffy & Moist in the middle , The portions were very generous so we could not eat it all . Perfect meal .

This will let us get over jet lag prior to driving home. We arrived just before Midday and although we were early (2pm check in) we were welcomed with a smile and were soon up to our large King size bed , balcony room . The room was very comfortable with a large flat screen TV , A mini bar & Fridge , Tea & Coffee . Good size Wardrobe with a Safe. The Bathroom was large with a Bath & Shower over , and you can lay down in the Bath . The balcony has a table and 2 chairs and views towards the Blue Mountains however due the weather we could not see anything . The hotel is just a few minutes from a good size shopping centre , Restaurants and Hillsong Church. They have a Bar and Restaurant on site and the Buffet Breakfast was good. They have an outdoor Pool and a very large car park .Accor Hotel Membership will give you Free WIFI .We enjoyed our stay and will stay again.

It takes around 40 minutes by MRT & Bus . Our SIA boarding pass gave us 10% discount off the entrance fee. The River Safari gives an Educational Journey through 7 of the great River systems of the world , highlighting the creatures that live in , on or near these rivers. I also highlights the stresses these River systems are under due to the influence of man . There is a short boat ride around the Lake included in the admission and for an extra $5 an amusement park style boat ride through a river system where you can see some of the most endangered animals . It is very Educational .

These boats are NOT original Bumboats but brand new replicas. They have lost all the character of the originals , the commentary , although interesting is just a recording , We prefer the original that was Live, from a local . The Boats were original Bumboats and had loads of Character . The price has gone up to $25 each , it was only $15 , 4 years ago .

We got the MRT and got off at Chinatown and took the Pagoda street exit. The Restaurant is about 100 mts from the Exit . We had a table right on Pagoda st which gave us a great view of the world going past . We had a couple of Pints of Tiger Beer and we ordered some Roast Duck breast . some beef & fried rice and a steam rice & vegetable , The steam rice was a little gluggy but overall the meal was delicious , and the Beer went down a treat.

We notice that the entrance fee and the Priority Pass had all gone up in price. The Priority pass is now $50SG each. We still purchased them .On entering the park we went on our favourite ride , Madagascar . love this ride , so much fun. We then began working our way around the park and discovered something. Not all the rides have priority pass . In fact 4 of our favourite attractions did not let us have priority . If we had been told this we would not have bought them . This put a dampener on the day and we only stayed for a couple of hours . Will not come again

A large Bathroom with a bath your can lay down in , with a Shower over . Good size flat screen TV , a fridge , Tea & Coffee and a small mini bar. 2 arm chairs and a small table . Plenty of storage , in wardrobe safe . The Hotel has a tour desk , 24 hr reception and Free Wifi .There is No Bar or Restaurant although there is Café/Restaurant separate to the Hotel where you can have Breakfast or Lunch or Dinner , either a Buffet or A La Carte .I will review these separately. The Hotel has good size Pool on the 2nd floor . The Décor is a bit dated but to be fair they are renovating the hotel from the Top down . We were on the 5th floor and renovations have reached the 7th & 8th floors . The is some noise during the day but this stops at 6pm and we were not concerned . There is a 24 Hour Chemist and a 24 hour Supermarket as part of the same building .
David P|89D9FD1F2984FF5B6C57B7C548066E62|Attractions|Kanchanaburi: Bridge Over the River Kwai|5| “Very Moving”|review_469963312|We did this trip as a Private Tour 11 years ago and it was a must do this time. We did this time as part of a group tour on a Bus . The bus picked us up from our Hotel at 6 am it is at least a 2 hour drive to Kanchanaburi from Bangkok , We had a stop for Coffee on the way . At Kanchanaburi , the first stop is the War Cemetery where around 6000 Allied POW 's who died during the construction of Bridge and the Rail line are buried . To wander among the graves in this beautiful location can't help but move you to tears especially when you read the ages of those that died . The next stop was the JEATH Museum . This small museum gives an insight to the horrors suffered by the POW's . There did not seem to be as much content in the Museum as there was 11 years ago which was a little disappointing . Next we had a trip up the river in a Long Tail Boat , quite an experience . We arrived at the bridge and walked across the bridge , if you have never been , walk the entire length ,it is nothing like the bridge in the Movie . There is plenty of information about the bridge at the side of the Rail Line . There is a small Market at the station where we did some shopping . We paid an extra 300 bht ($12) to upgrade our train ticket , totally worth it . You get a guaranteed seat with a cushion , drinks and snacks and a Certificate , and plenty of Water . The train ride goes for around one and a half hours on this 1 metre guage train. Quite an experience especially when it slows to a walking pace as we reach the cutting , a trestle 30 metres above the River with a very high overhanging cliff , this was all built by hand by the POW's . We soon arrived at our stop where we had Lunch , a Thai Buffet and Ice Cold Beer . The Beer was extra but a good price for a Pint . After lunch our Bus picked us for the 3 hour trip back to our Hotel. A great day out and highly recommended .

Apart from the usual Animals the Zoo has a central Lake where you can hire a paddle boat cheaply and have some fun. There is a Hop on Hop off train and a Restaurant and Bar on the Lakeside that serves pretty good food and lovely cold beer at pretty cheap prices . The entrance fee was 150bht ($6) Tip - travel by Taxi (insist on the meter) Tuk Tuk charge 200bht - Taxi was 100 bht from pratnum District to Dusit.

It was quite an eye opener to see the number of Tourist that do Not research the places they visit and do Not respect local culture . The Tourist police at the Palace stand no nonsense and I witnessed several Tourist marched away from the gates for not being dressed appropriately .The Grand Palace is must see for every Visitor to Bangkok .

We were picked up at 6-30pm and driven to the jetty , arriving around 7pm we then had to amuse ourselves for 45 minutes as we could not board till 8pm .So we wandered around a high end Shopping Mall till 7-50pm , Our guide gave us our Boarding Ticket and we joined the Hundreds of people waiting to board the 3 or 4 boats that were tied up 2 abreast at the Jetty . We finally got on board just after 8 pm and were shown to our Table. There was a "complimentary fruit juice" on the table . The Setting was quite nice and we were very close to the stage for the entertainment . A Waitress came to the Table and asked if we would like to order drinks , I checked the Drinks list and a chose a Bottle of Chardonnay ($60) from the small Wine list . 2 white wine and 1 red . No Bubbly .The Waitress then informed us that they had no Wine !We were shocked - this is a Dinner Cruise . people drink wine with Dinner especially at a Celebration . I told the Waitress , this is our 47th Wedding Anniversary and we wanted a nice Dinner with Wine. This will now not happen. The Waitress walked away and never came back .The boat cast off at around 8-10pm and everyone scrambled to the Buffet . It was in a separate part of the boat and was an absolute dogs breakfast . It was ridiculous , the buffet was laid out in front of a huge Air conditioning vent that was blowing Cold Air onto all of the food , the result was that the food was Luke Warm at best and a lot of the Hot food was Cold . Also the queue's for food were horrendous . We eventually served ourselves and we ordered 2 Singapore Sling ($16 each) from another Waiter . The Singapore Slings were totally devoid of Alcohol . A total Rip off.The meal was horrible .T .hat was only description I can give itThe Entertainment was Ok but the Singers were not Singing they were Lip Syncing , (Miming) . The Boat arrived back at the Jetty at 9-55pm , Hardly a 3 hour cruise. 1 hour 45 minutes .The next Morning both my Wife and I were having severe Diarrhoea , my Wife also vomiting , we were sick with this for 10 days and had to seek medical treatment in Singapore , this ruined our Holiday .Do NOT go on this Dinner Cruise unless you want to get sick

We booked a Tour to Dream world as this gave us a pick up from our Hotel and Transfer to Dream World , Entrance to the Park , Entrance to Snow Town and a Buffet Lunch and Transfer back to our Hotel.We were picked up at 9am , it takes around an hour to get to Dream World from central Bangkok. The entrance tickets were purchased for us , so no queueing .The park opens at 10 am and our transfer back to our Hotel was at 4:30 pm , so we had plenty of time in the park . The park is quite large with loads of rides for all ages as well as other attractions , so plenty to do . We had lunch at 1pm , which was a Thai buffet. Excellent food and plenty of it . Snow town is quite unique , The temperature inside is -4 C , with artificial snow to play in , a Taboggan run - great fun . They provide Boots and a Jacket to keep out the cold . It is not somewhere you can stay in for long , but 20 minutes is plenty to experience Snow and have little fun before you freeze . We went on most of the rides , including the Monorail . The Big Splash was our favourite , is great fun watching people getting wet . Our transfer to our Hotel was waiting for us and the whole day was great. So much cheaper than the Gold Coast and more to do and see including Lunch , Highly recommended .

The Buffet breakfast was up there with best we have had , however nobody seems able to cook Bacon to my liking .Eggs are cooked to order how you like them . Really enjoyed our stay and recommend this hotel . It is quite central , near to the Airport link , The Shopping district is 10 minutes walk as is the Sky train . Pratnum Market is 5 minutes walk .

From the outside it looks like a Pub. There is no onsite parking however we were able to find the last free parking in a backstreet just around the corner . The hotel is on the corner of 2 busy roads . The reception is like a kiosk inside the side door of the Hotel. The receptionist was pleasant and friendly and check in was fast . The room we were given was on the top floor at the back with windows looking out on to the balcony. The room was quite small , with a double bed with bedside cabinets , a small table and 2 chairs. a wall mounted TV . There is no in room fridge or wardrobe. There is a coats stand and coat hooks on the back of the entrance door . The bathroom was very compact , with a toilet , a shower cubicle and a very small wash basin with a small mirror on the wall above. This was totally in the wrong place as I had to stand on Tip toe to see my face while trying to shave in the morning . The walls are paper thin and you can hear people in other rooms conversations . We had literally no sleep as it rained heavily during the night and the water running of the roof overflowed the gutter right outside our window also the balcony lights out side lit up the room all night even with the blind drawn.. Also there is constant traffic noise throughout the night as well as other guest noise . There is enough Tea & Coffee but only enough milk for 1 cup each .The TV remote control did not work so we had to use the buttons on the TV itself . It is easy to get to the Airport and they can organise a shuttle service if needed . There is an on site Restaurant called Harrys Bar & Grill which I will review separately . Would not stay again

We drove up from the Gold coast and arrived around 11:30am . It was packed so not much room in the carpark . The queue to get in moved fairly quickly and we were soon inside . We used the map provided to begin making our way around . The map was a little confusing at first but I did get the hang of it. It was a Hot day and found that there is long walk between exhibits so by the time we got halfway around the park we were very tired . My Wife was telling me there used to be a Hop on Hop off bus service every 15 minutes but we did not see one. We decided to have some lunch . I queued for 15 minutes to order a burger & Chips and a greek salad . It took just on an hour for it to arrive at our table. For the money we paid it was very poor quality . We continued on around the park but it is far to big to see on foot . The Highlight was the Crocaseum show. We were glad to leave as it was an exhausting day. My Wife was disappointed as the Elephants have gone . Never again.

We were very disappointed . The room was so small my Wife was continually knocking her legs on the edge of the bed . The TV was on the Cabinet to the left of the beds so we had watch TV looking to the left . The only place to plug in the Kettle was behind the TV , and no room to put cups or saucers . No bench space , also no place to put our cases so they had to remain on the floor causing more congestion . Also only one bedside cabinet shared between 2 beds . They room was terrible. Would not stay again.

A testament to the food they turn out and the portions are huge . Will be back.

This time we were disappointed to find that most of the adult rides have been removed , the only adult ride left that was open was the Storm Coaster. The park is serviced by a Monorail but it is ridiculous the way it is run. It is so slow and patrons are treated like Kindergarten kids .It takes around 20 minutes to go around the park . The prices of Food are Rip off prices .It is NOT worth the Money . We will never go again.

Movie World|3| “Dissapointed”|review_453255113|We have been to Movie World in the past and my Wife wanted to try some of the new rides. We had a 4 park , 14 day pass so we were quickly through the turnstiles and into the park on opening time only to be told that we had to wait another 30 minutes until we were able to queue for a ride. This is ridiculous to open the park and then make people wait another half an hour. We eventually got on the Scoobee do ride. We queued for 25 minutes for a ride that lasted 3 minutes and was devoid of anything other than being thrown around in a semi dark room on an indoor roller coaster , pathetic. We then walked to the Wild West Falls ride . We enjoyed this in the past and there was not too much of a queue . We set off on the ride but only made to the bottom of the climb up to the top when the ride stopped and we sat in the Hot sun for around 15 minutes until it got going again . We completed the ride which we did enjoy . But the ride was closed soon after and we did not see it go again. We did go to the Hollywood stunt driver Show. It was ok but screeching tyres do nothing for me . There were several other major rides closed for the day including the Arkham Asylum and the Doomsday Destroyer . Overall , We would not go again .

I ordered Snapper & Chips (Fried) and my Wife had the same but Grilled.. They were extremely busy on the evening so there was a wait of around 40 minutes and I counted 9 different people working and they seemed very disorganised. When my order was called I was given a bag , I checked the contents and it only contained the Fish . I raised this with staff and they apologised and added the Chips. As I said they were very disorganised. The food was good.

The coffee is always amazing, the food is freshly made and the staff and managers there are relatively friendly. 3* because a few times now, I saw them throwing all of the leftovers. There are so many people dying from hunger so we should not throw food. There are a few departments from NEA that collects leftovers and gives it away to the needy. I do hope this really nice cafe can be kindhearted and give to the less fortunate rather than throw.

Set lunches are my fave as it affordable. What this resto needs is a service retraining for full timers. Giselle, the Filipino server, is very inattentive and doesn't even look at you when taking order. She lacks even a bit of politeness, with not even a smile when you say thank you to her. It might not be her fault as maybe she doesn't see that her attitude can actually spoil a good lunch/dinner. A service priority or staff retraining can do very well for this place. Luckily, the youngsters of this cafe are well mannered and friendly.

Also, the menu stated more options like dessert, etc. In the end, options were either veg or non-veg. Then a dessert would just come with it. But the beverages are amazing.

We managed to book a semi water villa. We're a bit hesitant at first cos its not a full overwater bungalow. But seeing it, it looked similar cos half of it was above water. The overlooking sea view from our room was to die for! The room itself was perfect too with an outdoor toilet that's as huge as a normal deluxe room in other hotels. All the staff were well trained and happy to serve. They did their best to always make us satisfied. Food were amazing! We bought full board meals and I can't help it but to eat my heart away all the time cos the food is soooo good. The island is situated in the middle of a crystal clear lagoon. This whole island looks like it has been taken out from a magazine. The only thing I regretted is not taking the sea plane and opting for the speedboat. The speedboat is too scary and long. It would make you dizzy. But besides that, all is awesome. I will definitely recommend!

We took fullboard meals and all were good. Their chef got skills! 1 guy(curly hair and skinny) from the restaurant always made us smile too. Softy, the receptionist, was also very friendly, witty and professional, who was happy to assist us with all our needs. But the best thing about this place was how homey it felt. Sidey, the owner, dived with us on most of the days. He's very fun and helpful. He even gave me a copy of my shots as my gopro got spoiled =( His' wife guided us as we snorkelled in Turtle Reef.

Believe me all this is the best serviced apartment n whole Sydney. The price is very good a 1 BHK will get around 150AUD - 200AUD depends upon the which day of the week. it has all the amenities, washing Machine, Drier , all Kitchenware, Dishwasher etc. The most important is location. The Chatswood Train Station is only 100 meters. All the departmental stores , Woolsworth , Aldi , Coles is a Walking DIstance. The Victoria Avenue is walking distance , which helds a small open Market every Thursday and Friday. The City Centre is is 7-8 Stations far. The only reason when I wantd to change my Apartment, because I got bored and started searching for other locationsMeriton North Sydney :- More Costly and Station is 10 mins walking distance Merition North Ryde :- remote location ,, all Markets and Stations are far awayMeriton Mascot :- Station very Close ( Not as close as Meriton Chatswood has). But nor Markets NearbyMeriton Paramatta :- Location Far away from Central and Parametta Station is 10 min walking DistanceSo at last Meriton Chatswood is very good in terms of location and Price and Service (which is i think would be equal in all the five star serviced apartments) One thing please consider while measuring distances in Syndey is the Sloppy Terrian. Either you have to walk down a Slope or climb up the slope. The Only disadvantage of the Meriton Chatswood is the Swimming pool.,, it a indoor swimming pool which somethimes get very humid and they do'nt chnage the water often.

Unfortunately we went on a Sunday, and it also happened to be a family day around Singapore. So it was very busy and probably the hottest day we had in Singapore. Unfortautely not that enjoyable. Also felt very bad for the Polar Bear, who didn't have an acclimatised enclosure.

Every bite was simply delcious and the staff were lovely. Even the cucumber water was an excellent touch. One of our guests is coelliac and they catered the food well for her. However communication could be better about that - she would be told she could have something, even though she knew it had gluten in it. What they meant was that they would change it for her, but they didn't explain that well in the first instance. The dessert was lovely, we ended up sharing a tasting platter, which was just delicious!!
JennaTassie|D888E040040609298837DE3D236558C9|Attractions|Nairobi: Africa Safari Classics|4| “Absolutely loved it!”|review_469973077|I would definitely go back (if I ever save the money) and book with Africa Safari Classics again. The people are fabulous - kind and funny. The culture is fascinating and the animals are marvellous. Thank you, Maurice, for organising a wonderful time and for being so flexible and willing to make an itinerary that suited us! My sister and I went on an East African 9 day Safarai in Kenya and Tanzania with Africa Safari Classics and have finally got around to doing a review (almost a year later, whoops)! We had a great time - loved the people and the environment. We'll attempt to give you a brief, or not so brief summary. First night we stayed in EKA hotel in Nairobi, which was lovely, clean and had good food. Maurice, our contact for Africa Safari Classics met us at the hotel the morning of departure for safari and went through everything with us again, prior to introducing us to our first guide, Mackenzie, who looked after us very well in Kenya and taught us our first Swahili words. The next morning we headed to Maasai Mara reserve, where we stayed for 2 nights at Basecamp Mara, which was amazing! We were blown away by the welcoming staff, fantastic accommodation and mass amounts of food (delicious, but a bit too much for us - 3 courses 3 times a day). Grounds were beautiful, 'tent' was amazing, loved the eco side of things and the positives for the environment. Also note Obama and his family stayed at Basecamp Mara too. We were warned to lock our tents to stop the Baboons 'taking our passports' and going through things. Basecamp is mostly fenced, however one sides boundary is 'fenced' by a river that also backs onto the reserve. You can often see animals passing through the reserve from the camp grounds. The Maasai staff also danced for us one night too, which was great to see their culture. Reflecting back, I think Maasai Mara was the best animal viewing we had. We managed to get up close to Lions, Cheetahs and many others. We managed to see a small crossing at the Mara River also, and Mackenzie did a great job getting us good spots while not interrupting the animals or other viewers. I liked the accessibility of Maasai Mara - there were a lot more tracks that meant you could get to other spots more easily if you saw something in the distance. Day 3 we drove from Maasai Mara (Kenya) to Serengeti (Tanzania). This was a very long day of driving, including through the boarder and immigration. We joined a small family and their guide for some of this day, who had booked with the same company. At the boarder we found our new driver, Abdul. Abdul, like Mackenzie, is a veteran at tour guiding and was a pleasure to be with. He joked with us and answered our many questions. We arrived in the Serengeti with a little game drive and arrived at our accommodation at Serengeti Tented Bush Camp. Upon arrival it looked like a bunch of canvas tents in a field, but the tents were simply amazing! My sister was actually speechless. We had the most comfortable mattresses there compared to everywhere else on our entire trip (including Singapore). We each had a double bed to ourselves, accompanied by a writing desk and sitting chair with footstool. The ensuite had a flushing toilet, but you need to give notice when you want a shower so they can fill it for you. Worst shower we had, but they made up with everything else, plus what else can you expect in the middle of the Serengeti?! The staff were very friendly and loved teaching us Swahili around the campfire. The food was lovely, but not quite as great as Basecamp Mara. Most of our stories are from our time in the Serengeti. We loved just being with the staff, learning the language and seeing the animals pass through the field. This accommodation is not fenced at all and we loved it! The first night I saw our guard chase away a Hyena over dinner. The second night I woke to hear a pride of Lions killing something right outside the staff tent (roughly 150m away from us), then heard all the Hyena's calling and fighting the Lions for the carcass. Hence why many of our stories come from that time.Day 5 we left Serengeti and headed to Ngorongoro Crater in the hope of finding a Rhino. The Crater is worth a look as it's quite fascinating. We did see one Rhino from afar, plus many other animals. We stayed at Bougainvillea Lodge, which wasn't the best accommodation we had, but still quite good. Day 6 we departed for Lake Manyara National Park. Lake Manyara was probably the prettiest park in my opinion due to the rainforest-like trees. Despite being the most beautiful, unfortunately it had the least animals and was quite anticlimactic at this stage in the trip. It's worth noting that we apparently did the cheaper route - Kenya to Tanzania, rather than Tanzania to Kenya, but therefore meant the smaller parks were at the end. We didn't see Lions in trees, which is unique to this park. We were told this is reasonably uncommon to see; not rare, but uncommon, mainly due to accessibility of cars. We stayed at Manyara Wildlife Camp, which was gorgeous once again!Day 7 we headed to Tarangire National Park, which was quite pleasant. Stayed at Lake Burunge Tented Camp, which was fabulous! We had time to relax with a swim. The staff sang a version of happy birthday to someone, which was joyful, cheeky and simply beautiful!The only day I felt unsafe was the day we crossed the border. I found the people, it was mainly the children we noticed, were less friendly than in Kenya. Of course some were great, but others yelled at us as we drove past and seemed angry we were there. A few matters later dawned on me. Basecamp Mara in Kenya works well in conjunction with the local Maasai people, and many Kenyan's have experienced the good of tourists and missionaries, and realise the good it brings to their country. However the roads we travelled on our first day in Tanzania went through many secluded villages. The tour cars travel on these dirt roads, generally varying 60-80km/hr, which creates mass amounts of dust and disruption, while the locals are just trying to live a simple life and move their herds from one place to another (generally on the roads). If you get the chance, go!:)

I went with my family due to the hype around it for a beer and dinner. It was crowded considering there isn't any other good place nearby. I was mighty disappointed with the food. The beer is okie dokie and I also tried some regular hot stuff. I think so long as you stick to some snacks you should be okie. We tried some rotis and chicken gravies and some snacks.It was just average from taste standpoint. My daughter ordered for a Burger which was okie.My wife and friends had gone earlier and had tried some snacks as well and she found it just about average. Overall a good place for some beer in that area but I wish the food could have been better. I liked the District 6 pub and brewery better than this primarily for the snacks and the beer as well.

This is located inside one of the Malls. The place is neat and clean. We ordered some Kuttanadu chicken curry, rotis, chicken biriyani, with some starters and drinksStarter we ordered was some crispy veg fried stuff and it was good.The Mojito was okie and some mocktails that we tried was okie as well. The Kuttanadu chicken curry was a disappointment. The chicken biriyani was okie as well Nothing great to write home about. The mixed veg soup gravy was okie as well.The service took time as there was one person taking order for many tables. I think there is no other decent restaurant nearby and probably the reason for the crowd and also that it is part of a Mall.In general, I found the food just about average.

We were dropped at the Lake song resort. Earlier plan was to go to KTDC resort which is supposed to be very good but was under renovation. Hence had to go to this particular resort.This resort 3 star property is built on a 10 acre land and is besides some of the 5 star resorts such as Taj and some other resorts. It is facing the Vembanad Lake which is the largest lake in India. The room was very neat and clean and the greenery and the drizzle around was very welcoming site. It has a decent swimming pool close to a green stretch of trees and some nice seating area near the lake.. They have a volleyball court et all. Also they provide some free 1 hour boat rides (which we did not take). The buffet breakfast which is free was good with nice spread of north and south Indian dishes. It also had various bread options with cup cakes and croissant. The food when you order in the resort is on the expensive side. The bad experience I had was with the rice was half cooked and I told them that but when I asked for refund they did not agree. I expected them to be professional considering they are charging food on the higher side. Food in general is average to good depending on dishes you order.If you would want to try some local cusine specially non-vegetarian, you could go to a Toddy shop which has a family restaurant around 5 kms from the resort called Tharavadu.

You can reach out to any of the good restaurants nearby. ProsDeluxe Large room with living area for watching T.V. (I had taken a non-A.C room for our family as the AC looked a bit stuffy but maybe because it was not occupied earlier)Service is very good as they are ready to help get you stuffIts neat and cleanConsThere was no ceiling fan instead had wall fans which is an irritant for me.No amenities such as fridge, coffee machine et allThere does not seem to be enough parking but they may have options to park it nearbyNo restaurant but they do get you breakfast, tea coffee from a nearby veg restaurant which is good (Also multiple good restaurants nearby walkable distance)

Non-AC rooms might be cheaper. First impression changed a bit as soon as we saw the place. It is an average place. The rooms are small specially the non-deluxe ones. The deluxe room is slightly bigger with a small bathroom. In no way it is closer to a good hotel.My final comment on this is if you are looking for a cheap place to stay, only for the sake of sleeping and getting out for visiting places, you might find this place okie considering it closer to the city. I personally would prefer to have a better place even if it is for a day..

Its about a km odd on the highway from the bus stand on the right hand side. Breakfast We tried the local kerala cuisine as the saying goes be a Roman when in Rome.Started with Appam and channa curry (kadala curry) and they gave us a sample to try the green gram masala. I ordered for egg roast which is roasted onion and egg. We ordered for Puttu as well along with the aforesaid. The taste was awesome and presentation was good. Everything we tried for breakfast including the coffee was excellent. LunchWe tried Ghee rice, Veg kurma, Meat (kerala style)DinnerWheat Parantha, Pathiri, Veg Kuruma, Meat roastEverything we tried in Wilton is good and some dishes were awesome. Customer service is excellent.Abdul who is the owner was extremely affable and was checking at each place how if everything was fine.We picked up some dry fruits and Tunisian Dates from the Restaurant and they are awesome.Price point is mid range. the morning breakfast which I've mentioned costed me 230 INR.If you happen to visit Sultan Bathery (Wayanad) or plan to go via SB, do visit this place.BTW, Wilton plans to have a stay option (hotel) in the same place inauguration in another month or so.

I've been to the Universal Studios in LA, U.S and thought this may not be so interesting. But i found this equally good but just that it is not as big.The best is the 4D experience of transformers which my wife and kid were just clapping while they were experiencing the 4D experience.The kids will love it with many rides and food options. This is one day well spent sometime you may get tired walking around a bit but its a good experience for kids and adults alike.

The bathroom is very small and looks used up.- The restaurant is good but on the expensive side.- There is no room service, you need to order and take it from the restaurant- There are not many good options other than small restaurants which may not be up to mark- Buffet breakfast was okie (same stuff served on both days I stayed :-)-

It also has a 100 meter man made waterfall which is nice.Kids will love it.A must visit attraction.

Additional Info : My wife had forgotten her purse and we realized post reaching india. I spoke to the folks there and they connected me to the Lost and Found department. Each and everything from the id cards, to chocolates to biscuits was there and they called out to me. I've to thank Sam (from lost and found department) who helped coordinate and courier the purse back to us.Not So Good part- Food options in Langkawi are very less and the hotel though has a decent menu, not all options were available. Wish they can cater to providing the food mentioned in the menuOverall an awesome experience being in Langkawi with some Scuba diving and the stay at the hotel was awesome.
SanthoshMohanan|E028C1A2EF9A1741F468A81CDA1F348A|Hotel|Singapore: CherryLoft|2| “Average Hotel or below par”|review_469376180|Good part is this is it is about 10 min walk to other good Indian restaurants. Other than that there is nothing good about this hotel.Cons- Their check-in time is 3 P.M or so. If you reach early, even if they have all rooms free, they will not check you in. Instead there is something called as Early check-in where you pay some 50 or 100 sing dollars and they will get you checked in within 15-20 mins.- Rooms are small and average (sometimes I think they should visit our Indian hotels in India which can put them to shame)- Free internet available for 1 Singapore dollars :-)- There is a restaurant in this hotel - Breakfast is free ( Its average and if you are late, you may not find stuff). One incident to mention which is about service quality (My daughter 9 yr old who went to the restaurant and picked up banana for me as I was skipping the breakfast was questioned by the lady in the front desk and was told that she cannot carry any food to the room). This is Service ( really)?.  - Restaurant serves only Thali (veg) basic stuff for Lunch and Dinner. No other options available. I did not try the thali as there was a good indian restaurant about 5 mins walk which was good and prices were nominalOverall, Not recommended. There are lot better hotels who understand what Service means in hotel industry and does not function like a Lodge in india.

Best to go before 9 A.M and back. The Bahubali statue is huge. I saw there was some pooja happening. Not of so much of interest to me. One time visit is fine to this place.

This is a resort in the industrial belt but is away from any noise and found it very serene. The main build is follow through of the reception, Cafetaria and then rooms.Some of the call outs are Restaurants roofs very high and is very cool. In general it is cooler inside.It has a massive indoor badminton court and is definately very good.Let me talk through some of the key stuff that as a family we look forRooms - Rooms are very big, beds are nice, Bathrooms are big but is not functionally great. A.C worked for us. There was problem with fridge but they got that changed. There are 2 guys who run around taking care of everything , as it was few months back i forget their names. .The room i stayed was in the main building and room facing the garden or empty place was good.Food - Food is good but not excellent. The buffet breakfast is okie with minimal spreads , you could request for hot dosas eggs etc and they do take care of providing all of that. People are service oriented.Activities - Swimming pool was well maintained and clean. You could play volleyball, badminton (very good indoor court), table tennis, chess, foosball etc. There is a water body nearby where you should ask for boating which is maintained by the resort.Evenings - Bonfire was there and the view is good the lawn.I took this place to visit Cons - I wish the team was professionally trained to make the experience bettter . There was delay in checkin due to the room which was to be alloted to us, some confusion around payments as i had made online payment.But definately the guys there did try to do their best to help through the issues which we faced. Overall a good experience as my family liked the place.

You get free earphones and information in several languages which was cool. There are about 6 tours you can take so we first did the most interesting ones and afterwards stepped out where we wanted to see more of the area. On the map we got when buying the ticket was also indicated that they offered 2 "free" walking tours, one in Little India and one in Chinatown. We wanted to do the one in Chinatown first but when we arrived at the meeting point on the time the tour started there was an employee who said that the tour schedule was updated since 1 february 2017 and that is was on another day...We complained at the head office as they did not feel the need to change this in their street maps. First they wanted to make us believe that we got just the one wrong map that was left, but we checked and in every bus they still gave people their old maps with the wrong information. As a compensation they gave us a free duck tour for the next day but when we looked at it afterwards, it was actually a very childlike tour at Marina Bay so we did not go. So do check out at the head office for the correct schedule for the walking tours. They are listed as free, but when you get there, the guide tells you that he works on a tip-base...so if the tour is good, you tip him, if not,you don't need to tip him. The tour in Little India was correctly scheduled and was very nice. And we tipped :-)

We got a discount coupon form our B&B and we went there early in the morning when it just openend. There were some groups of schoolkids but we never had a crazy amount of visitors, which was nice. Loads of birds to spot and see really close. Some of them were injured and put back to health by the caring staff. They explained they tried to revive sick or injured birds and free them if possible. They only keep the ones that can't survive on their own in nature...which I can totally appreciate and understand. They also had a train tour which is mostly for kids but we enjoyed as well. We had a really good day and took loads of pictures. Look out for free roaming squirrels and lizzards!

I have stayed in this hotel about a dozen times now and I have never gotten bored with contemporary design of the One Bedroom Pool Villa. I can't speak for the other rooms but the One Bedroom Pool Villa is one of my all time favourite hotel rooms despite the fact that this isn't a new hotel. It has been very well planned and you wouldn't want to leave once you are back in the room. I must say that the room prices are relatively more costly than many other 5 stars hotels on the island but it is well worth the money spent. I usually drive to Singapore from Kuala Lumpur because it is more convenient and what I really like about this hotel is that parking is free as well as "Sports Car" friendly. I do not have to worry about scraping the under carriage of my cars when getting in and out of the carpark.

Unfortunately, I had a flight to catch the next morning at 9 am, therefore it was less than a 15 hrs stay altogether. I booked for a Caroline Aster suite but I was upgraded to an ultra luxurious suite, thanks to my Amex Centurion Card. It was an extremely large suite for 2 persons and we didn't even mange to make use of 3/4 of the suite although I am not complaining. It's a once in a lifetime experience because that particular suite costs as much as car. The Private Butler service was excellent and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommended if service is your priority but if you are into modern and contemporary hotel room designs, then you must might want to reconsider.

You have to try their dumplings and other food also must try here and you will not regret. Advance booking is better coz most of the time fully book but if walkin you will just wait few minutes so it's fine if your not in rush. There is no toilet inside the restaurant so you need to go up one level in the escalator beside the restaurant.

Lots of shops and restaurant to choose just inside the hotel. I enjoyed much was the wave pool and river pool which open from 9am to 6PM. Other option is to try the indoor pool that close until 9PM if I'm not mistaken. I tried the gym as well and staff was kind that proactively offered water and towel. Suite dining was fast and great service. I tried to use the phone inside our room to request some shampoo and the staff who answered from greetings speak Chinese, until I spoke back English then she just changed her language. Female changing room or shower room was kinda small but have steam and sauna available. One thing i don't like was one security the way approached my cousin when she's seating in the hotel lobby near reception around 4AM and told that cannot seat if there is no key. Also take note that in the pool only 2 adult and 2 child can enter you have to show your key card and staff will stamp a mark in your hand or arm.

But it become different the way they cook and serve it, also the ambience of the restaurant. Porto restaurant I find it home style semi casual ambience is nice and located in Taipa Village near the Starbucks they have second floor that can accommodate more guest. Also they have small branch nearby which 5 to 8mins by walk and along the road area. If you get lazy which one to order you may try their set menu good for two or 3 and so on that will provide the best option for you to try. For us we tried the set for two and we had starter salad followed by mushroom creamy soup that I find it good. Also had the white pasta that my first time in that kind of taste and I can say it was ok but I can't remember the name of that pasta They served dessert as well it's like a matcha sweet cake something a small portion of it. Then we ordered a baked shrimp was so good. The staff also will ask you to pick from 3 choices of drinks which is free so we end up trying the famous Sangria. Overall the price was resonable and nice restaurant. Order was deliver fast as well and staff are attentive.

Also near to Window of the world train station so it's convinient. From the Shekou port I took a taxi to here around 45CNY 20mins. check in time after 2PM and check out before 12NN. Have complimentary breakfast from 7:30AM to 10PM in level 1 near check in counter. The breakfast was mostly Chinese food so I honestly didn't enjoyed, specially don't have coffee or bread or fruits or salad I just ate boiled egg. Most of the staff speak Chinese but they are kind and attentive still sincere to help. Have two free bottle of water inside the room. Have available towel and toothbrush as well. They have small cafe in second floor so comfy and nice ambience. But the menu written in chinese only so i find it difficult good thing the staff really helpful and even used his cellphone for language translation☺️ so cute :) I like the atmosphere outside the hotel looks like in Europe side :) buildings kinda old but find it ok.

Ticket cost 80CNY you can buy in te ticketing counter inside the Shenzen Tourist Information in front of the IMAX Cinema in OCT Bay. Show will start exactly 8PM and 15 minutues before they have fountain show so if you wanna watch go there earlier. The venue is in Water Show Teater you can find the way near to Starbucks just nearby to the place of ticketing. Language in the show is Chinese but of course we focus on the water and light show so didn't notice about the language Btw it's an open air teater so if it's raining they stop the show. It's good for all ages :)

I took a ferry boat via TurboJet from Macau ferry terminal to Shekou and it takes around 1 hour. fare 238MOP/HKD. From the Shekou Port I took a taxi to Window of the world(WOW) around 20mins. and the fare was 45CNY. That time it was sunny day and it's really hot so good thing i had my umbrella with me. You can buy the ticket 200CNY in the left side of the stairs before the entrance. Also have few restaurant available and I decided to have lunch at KFC before I started, you need lot of energy coz it's more on walking. What I enjoyed a lot was riding in the Camel which cost 20CNY and tried the costume also 20CNY. The staff will ask you if you wanna have photo that cost 20CNY per photo. Be careful coz if they capture many then you also need to pay it all like in my experienced 7 photos i thought only for trial and I can choose which one i want to print. But in the end the lady said i need to pay it all . Just keep walkin and you will see different landmarks and you will enjoy taking photos on it coz it looks like really nice seems your travelling all over the world. Also at night the have nice light of the park :)

Open at 11:30AM to 11:30PM they have outdoor seats that has a view of Venetian Sky and start from 12Noon every 30mins til 6Pm it has a entertainment show nearby like playing violin, acrobats etc. so outdoor seats is kinda not advisable if you like privacy or calm area. We are total of 4 and we order 4 dishes and 3 bottles of beer and 1 pitcher of fresh juice and we paid like around 1200MOP/HKD. I think the price is reasonable since we enjoyed much the food specially the sweet and sour sparibs.

Open from 11AM to 11PM have entrance fee MOP/HKD100 if you want to go up to level 7 which has a love bridge that can put your love lock like in Paris. You can bring your own love lock but should be not to heavy but can purchase in Eiffel souvenir shop were the entrance going up in the tower is. Also have the level 37 if you want to have a look for the Cotai Strip or basically the view of the hotels nothing much to see. I prefer stand outside the hotel and have a whole view of the tower, it has music light show in the evening I think start from 7PM till midnight every 30 mins. If you have ferry ticket from Cotai Waterjet from HK>Macau they have promotion that you can just show to the ticketing counter your ferry ticket used on the same day then you can go up to Eiffel Tower for free :)

Can't open umbrella and you cannot move to your seat once show started. It's a entertainment were have actors perform a story. Have lots of rides to try too. You should save energy before go here in Universal to make sure you can try all. They open at 10AM and close I think till around 1900. Better you eat first before go here coz food inside is kinda more expensive. Place is actullay not so huge but if have many people you need to spend more time waiting in the line. For us we started at 1300 then finished at 1700. So halfday will be fine I think.

We had bad experienced in front desk during our check in, we understand that the staff cannot find our request in our booking etc. but the thing was the staff attitude seems that he don't want to assist us which make us feel discrimanated. The tone of his voice was kinda rude and assertive, totally he didn't follow the hotel standard. Moreover, for the housekeeping service was good, concierge was very helpful and always happy to assist. Call center staff over the phone speak clearly and for the arrival experienced guest service offered to deliver our luggages in the room so we don't need to carry all during check in. The infinity pool is the main highlight of the hotel located in 57th floor you can only access it if you have room key with you as you need to tap in the entrance. One key one person only. Pool open until 11:30PM. If you want to look for restaurant or something to eat Marina Bay Shoppes is 5 minutes by walk in the hotel.

Although it's still open to public it is not as lively as before, nowadays only few restuarant and branded shoppes is here. But for me this place is nice because there is replica of collesium like in Rome and many stylish buildings that you may really feel that you are in the other place like Italy. If you want some peaceful place then better to visit here, not too many people came here. Also it's near to seaside so you may seatback, relax while watching the view. Don't expect too much to this place if you are after the fabulous place, I think this place is for those who want to walk around and relax. You may reach this place via Taxi that will cost you less than MOP/HKD100 and Venetian Hotel have free shuttle bus go to Sands Macao Hotel and from Sands Macao Hotel you may just cross the road to reach the Macau Fisherman's Wharf. Better to came here late afternoon so the weather is good and you will be able to see the nice lightnings of the place as well.

Have two floors and mostly for dine is in second floor were they have al fresco seats to choose with overlooking view of the Venetian pool. Also they have Sprito bar started a 18:00 so if you want to have some drink and have ladies night during wednesday from 22:00 to 1:00AM. For the food was average, I am pasta lover and I find their pasta good. I just got annoyed when one staff whenever she pass by to our table or we ask something to her she keep on repeating that already last order and their kitchen will be close. Not just once but more than 3 times that make us feel to eat fast and leave. However, the Filipino staff are very polite and kind explaining that we can take our time and enjoy our lunch. At the end when I got our bill i noticed in the receipt the staff who assist us from the very start charge 3 set of pasta which was we only got two. I think almost her break during that time so she's on rush and left us. The Filipino staff said why we didn't tell a while ago, I said because she just left us and I didn't know she charge us 3. She was not attentive rather she explained to me something confusing and sounds assertive. So the Filipino staff said he will check to the manager if still can cook, (tryin to make up things) I said no worries since I know the kitchen already closed. I hope next time it will not happen again to other guest. Anyway it just my experienced, but for the food and atmosphere of the restaurant was awesome.

Kinda mix of sour and sweet not sure if it's called vinegar in Vietnam but some other said it's fish sauce but im surely addicted to it.

We order like 4 fried rice, each plate of fried rice is good for 2 if you don't each much then 6 orders of spring rolls; each plate has 4 pcs ☺️. 1 order grilled chicken barbeque with peanut sauce around 5pcs. per order. Baked mussels with garlic but just so so it's just simple not for recommendation . For drinks we had lemon ice tea and milk tea. For those, seems we only pay like HKD500 plus something.

Location is near to Megamall just cross the road, and to other mall like Shangrila Mall, Starmall and St. Francis Square. Outside also have 7'11, Jolibee, nearby ATM Machine and Bank so it's very convenient. During the check in you need to provide deposit fee of PHP2000 or if you have credit card will do, debit card they will not accept. You need to spend few minutes waiting for the lift specially if have many people. And you need your key card to have access in the lift to go to the floor of your room. Inside the room have available plates, spoon and fork, cooking utensils as well since have small kitchen there. Refrigerator and microwave is also available. My stay had breakfast for two and you need to go level 8 function room between 6AM till 10AM, just a small space but it's fine. Food is average. Pool is in level 52MD until 11PM so it's great coz you don't need to rush but you need to bring your own towel, have available pool for kid as well. After check out you can also leave your baggage in the reception until 5PM for free. One thing caught my attention was around 8:00PM I was sleeping alone then someone doorbell in my room twice but I didn't able to open it immediately coz I was just awake and thinking I didn't expect anyone to come so a little bit afraid also. Then I heard someone open the door so I immediately walk over to see. Then there was 1 girl and 2 boys they are staff of the hotel and asked if they could clean the room. I said "no need". Anyway I'm just wondering coz normally cleaning is during day time and even they doorbell they should voice out the word "housekeeping" or the moment they open the door they should say it. So I find it unprofessional. And Pls. take note don't use the landline phone in the room to call other landline even just in Manila coz during check out they will charge you.

Jessica R|610D77F88DDF60EC4E7F9EAC5599FDED|Hotel|Singapore: Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel|1| “Worst First Night”|review_469501954|So we had a not so good experience from the Marriott Tang Plaza on our first day/night.Back in November 2016 I bought a Luxury Escapes Package to stay at this Hotel in March 2017 (earlier this month).At the time of purchase and booking we had a choice of 2x Single beds or 1 King Bed. Obviously being a couple, i specified we wanted a King Bed. No issues… you would think.Leading up to our stay I received a few emails asking for our arrival details, times, flights etc, which I supplied literally straight after I received the emails.Sounds good so far…We arrived at the Marriott Tang Plaza At about 1pm, 2pm was the official check in (so we were an hour early). We proceeded to check in when they told us our room with TWO SINGLE BEDS was ready. I immediately asked why we were allocated two single beds when we asked and requested 4 ½ months ago for a King bed as we are a couple??? To this my response was “We have no Kind beds available at this moment”. The girl then tried to help by saying she could put us in another room for the first night overlooking the pool and then we could change the second night (mind you this was only a 3 night stay). She said this room had a pool view and was very nice. I thought ooh this sounds good, ok let’s do it.WELL, when we got to our room, it was an adjoining room (which we did not like the idea of, or want) and there was absolutely no view, the view we did have was of some dirty roofs and a vacant court yard which was obviously not used. It was also right in front of the elevators and directly next to the pool Restaurant where we could hear noises. It was definitely not overlooking the pool as first described. I immediately went down stairs to complain, their response was I could have a better room on a higher floor but I’d have to pay an extra $76SIN per night, which I flat out refused.I went back upstairs and we thought we’d just suck it up and went for a walk. When we came back we thought we’d watch a movie, then we found the sound on the tv did not work…what next?While we were trying to get the tv to work, because our room was so close to the elevators, we had some guy think it was funny to keep pressing our door bell multiple times and then hide before going down the elevators.So then we decided to go up to the executive floor for dinner (included in our package), we then found out that our key cards were programmed incorrectly so instead of taking us to the executive floor at level 27, it would only take us to level 26. So for dinner that night and breakfast the following morning, we had to take the elevator to level 26, then go through the back emergency stairs (through all the hotel trolleys etc) up to level 27 and then into the executive lounge to eat.Just when you thought that was crappy enough on our first day, when we finally went to bed after all this, at 1.20am in the morning our phone randomly decided to put itself on speaker and made this horrible loud beep noise… which we abruptly awoke to and thought we were in the middle of a fire drill… only to work out that it was the phone which we then had to disconnected.When we woke up the next morning and went down stairs to change rooms, I told reception about everything that had happened and they didn’t really care.Once we were moved to our next room, it was still directly opposite the elevators (which we didn’t want) and there was also what looked to be coffee cup stains on the bathroom makeup table… we just gave up at this point. This was definitely the worst first night we have ever spent in a hotel, especially only being there for 3 nights.We would have expected more, especially from a Marriott hotel.Would not recommend.

Traveling across Asia, I thought Macau was the perfect place to finally try the famous Portuguese dishes (Bacalhau being one of them). After a long, very long ride from MGM, we arrived at Fernando's. It was so hot inside that we were literally sweating (no air conditioning).We ordered some prawns, Cantonese rice and Bacalhau with potatoes. The bacalhau was drowning in burnt garlic cloves and a sea of olive oil. The fish was so dry that we couldn't eat it, the potatoes were served with no seasoning. The Cantonese rice had pork in it, and it wasn't mentioned anywhere in the menu. It was the most boring blunt food I have ever tasted. We had to take the sauce from the prawns and mix it with the rice for us to swallow it.The prawns were good though, it was the only thing we "enjoyed" eating.The only positive thing that I could think of was the fact that the waiter was really nice and friendly.The whole experience was a real disappointment. We went to Macdonald's after that. Yes, it was that bad!

I am not fond of fusion places or local adaptations. So when I go to a Mexican restaurant it has be as authentic as possible or if not, I'm not setting foot in there again.El Centro combines a smart menu of authentic Mexican dishes, and it does offer some options for those that are more prone to Tex Mex or Cal Mex plates.The tortillas are good quality, corn maze or flour are fine. Not the thick tasteless ones that are sold in supermarkets.I usually have mole enchiladas or the three tacos and I am fine with them.One awesome dish that they offer is an array of Pozoles. This is a hominy soup made with a paste of mixed chilis and oregano plus one type of meat (chicken, pork and shrimp-which is a kind of new version).It has good sides and the drinks (micheladas) are very good. Compared to Tacombi this has a different feel, but the food tastes really well. Service at times can be a little slow because it is usually really full and the kitchen size is limited.One really nice thing is the art displayed on the walls and tables. Everything made with quirky Mexican items such as bottlecaps, etc.Give this place a try and you'll be a repeat customer quite soon.

SuitcaseLawyer|D746D2820F740E0854BD91D55F4D2C7B|Restaurant|The Woodlands: Shogun Japanese Grill & Sushi Bar|4| “Well executed neighborhood sushi teppanyaki restaurant. Good quality ingredients. Consistent.”|review_491605764|This is the newest Shogun restaurant in the Houston metro area. Shogun is a small but growing chain of sushi/teppanyaki food in Houston. It has grown from a few restaurants in small secondary strip malls to over 15 and growing even outside of Houston.This location is really nice. It is in the new Creekside Village Green shopping center. The restaurant has a nice bar/dining area with TVs and a nice sushi bar, and in the back there is a number of teppanyaki tables. The menu is standard American sushi rolls (not an omakase authentic Japanese restaurant), and there is teppanyaki tables for Japanese style fried rice and sashimi foods. The restaurant has very fresh ingredients, good fish, you ask for a roll and you don't get the over salty mystery fish pounded to a pulp as filling. But rather slices of filets as they should be.For a strip mall sushi place this is the best around the area. Maybe as good as Sakekawa up the road once was.Try the yellow tail rolls and the various dishes of teppanyaki, if you want a Benihanna style experience try the teppanyaki tables at the back. Prices are mid range, and for an informal restaurant, this is quite good.

Clean and consistent.”|review_486202463|Skeeter's is a consistent family grill restaurant chain. It is a small chain. It is well ran. You have a nice menu of home style grill dishes including an array of hamburgers, turkey burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, and Tex Mex food such as fajitas, etc.The food is really good tasting and it is fresh. Compared to a fast casual chain such as Chili's. Friday's or Applebee's, I would not hesitate to choose Skeeter's than those restaurants. They have a Sunday brunch, ice cold beers and Mexican coke.It is a simple no frills restaurant, but it delivers quite well.It has TV's all around if you want to watch sports.

Lacks identity.”|review_484228555|I stumbled in here for lunch last January. It is a very nice property in a convenient location in George Town. It is really nicely done. You enter through the former lobby that also houses a sweet shop. Then inside is a full service restaurant. It offers nice drinks and dishes. Many seafood options and steaks, sandwiches and appetizers. I think it's a bit too Americanized to my taste. I would do something more unique, yes with mainstream international food, but less bland. Why not offer some Malay/French/UK fusion? Less menu options but better tasting? I did like it. I think that the finishes were really nice. Step inside, desserts are really good.

Courteous, friendly, simple and honest.”|review_484221593|If you're in the Lake Conroe, Walden, April Sound or even The Woodlands area, this is a really nice diner to attend. It is a no frills authentic eatery that yes, primarily offers steaks, but its menu actually includes everything from quesadillas and cheese filled jalapenos, to pastas, to hamburgers, grilled chicken sandwiches, and many other awesome dishes. Great desserts too.Service is very friendly. Honestly, this restaurant is far better than what you'll find on S.H. 105.It is located in Montgomery. The old original seat of Montgomery county not far from the Lutheran Church that saw its first German settlers that actually leased the land to then Mexico. Don't miss it!

It can be crowded so reserve in advance if possible. The food and drinks were on spot. They will seat other people in your table if there are spots available. It is that busy.

Good location.”|review_484140458|Being in such a nice location and having the opportunity to be a great venue for families and people visiting Lake Conroe, it is a shame that this restaurant's staff, kitchen and management fails to deliver on service, initiative and on good tasting fresh seafood. It's like the location gives them enough business to lay on their backs. Servers are slow, disinterested. The food is truly not something to write home about. Being close to the ocean, you would suspect that they have some pride on delivering something fresh, unique and authentic, but it's like going to a chain seafood restaurant in Montana or North Dakota.Think of eating some fish dish at Applebee's. It tastes as commissary food brought from deep freeze. Kitchen is slow, inconsistent. Ask for a beer and maybe you'll get it, maybe not.It's a chain restaurant and not a good one at that. Make reservations forehand if you want to come here on a weekend. Come with low expectations and patience.

Sometimes too crowded.”|review_483743503|I actually like this chain a lot. It's a burger place, but it is laid out as a diner. It offers great appetizers, surprisingly good sushi, and much more than hamburgers. Great drinks and desserts too.This location is quite busy. At times a lot of tourists. It's ok. Just sometimes service can be a little surly, you'll lose your server and it can get slow. Forget about choosing tables. If there are one or two of you they'll try their best to seat you at the bar even if there are tables open, not always though.I have to say the sushi is really good. Not an omakase spot, but just as good as any quality sushi roll place. Sides are great, onion rings are delicious. The tuna sandwich is delicious. They have some crazy desserts, really good. Opens late too,

Slow service at times.”|review_483738343|This is a nice spot to go on 8th Ave. when you're hungry on a late night and feel that you want a beer, watch a game on TV and eat something good.Food is alright, I'm sorry not to give it a 4 grade, but the hustle and bustle of its location and its inconsistent service simply don't allow me to call it good. Servers at times are few, they are forgetful, and will cater more to the drinking folks than the dining folks. If it's a business decision that's fine. Food is normal bar food. Nothing exceptional, but it is good. You'll leave satisfied.Hostess is nice, when the owners are at the door they'll treat you nice. It's after you are seated when the service drops. Just go with patience and you'll be OK.
SuitcaseLawyer|D746D2820F740E0854BD91D55F4D2C7B|Restaurant|New York City: Kodama Sushi|4| “Affordable Authentic Japanese in the Theater District. Not fancy but good tasting.”|review_483734593|I have been here several times. It is a true Japanese sushi restaurant. It doesn't offer the most courteous service, the dining area can look a little run down and some servers can have a borderline nasty attitude. But the sushi is quite good, the rice they use is good. The fish is fresh and they take bold steps in new recipes like offering the "forbidden" black rice (which is not rally rice), but is nutty tasting and healthier. If the owner/chef is in, the service is much better. When the owner is not, the kids play a bit. It is a roll sushi place. Not omakase. So it is not a high-end sushi bistro by any means. But the rolls taste good.I don't know why the restaurant has surly service, maybe because it is on the edge of Hell's Kitchen in some sorts. But the store front on 8th Ave was refurbished as a form of to go order sushi and it does look nicer.You are going to have good roll sushi here. Some Kinky Boots rolls or whatever broadway show they feature as a roll. By the way, a lot of Great White Way actors eat here between rehearsals and matinee shows. Just don't expect a tremendous friendly service. Chef Kodama however is friendly, but he's rarely behind the counter and he won't be your server. Enjoy!

It is a huge development in Panama and it is well located close to the Banking district and the Balboa ave. Somewhat walking distance to the "Cinta Costera".The hotel is behind a mall where the actual Hard Rock Cafe is housed, you can access the hotel from the mall via a walk way. There are plenty of bars, restaurants and the amenities are nice. My only quibble with this hotel is that it does get loud. The pool sometimes has people that aren't even staying in the property. The mall houses a casino, and I saw some raunchy episodes. I'm no prude, but maybe not a family hotel.It has a Hard Rock store where you can buy regular Hard Rock fare. It also has a bunch of rock and roll memorabilia all throughout.This is a HUGE building, I'd say it is one of the largest Hard Rock property, at least that I've seen. Having said that, the Hotel is segmented within. Depending of the type of room and floor your experience can be quite different. Kind of like a cruise. There's different VIP access bars, and spots. I wouldn't stay here again when I came for business. Maybe the hardest part is that there isn't a large concert/restaurant area. The one that exists is small in my opinion. But hey, to be frank I had little time to peruse the hotel as I did come in a business trip. If you are in a party mood you may like it, the fact that there's no beach close by in the city, I'd prefer a beach resort if I had time to come as in a vacation.

One of the best Spanish restaurants in the State.”|review_483533107|La Dorada is sometimes mistaken as a seafood restaurant. It is really a Spanish restaurant. I believe a lot of people go there with a different expectation and maybe dissatisfied that they don't find common American seafood dishes. I've eaten here several times. Their fish dishes are some of the best I have ever enjoyed. The sea salt fish offerings is one of the best I've had away from Spain. The appetizers are great along with fresh gazpacho.I also tried a very good seafood paella. This restaurant is a nice experience with a great ambiance. It is formal and people enjoy it. It does offer some steaks and other Spanish fare.Try the desserts and the Spanish coffee too.

They have some interesting dishes and their delivery in tool pans and mechanic shop feel is nice. It has a good layout and nice Gas Monkey memorabilia on display. I've had the garage nachos, the green chile chicken sandwich and the avocado Caesar salad. To be honest they were quite good and consistent. The beer they offer is quite nice as well, they have house beers, craft beers and normal brand beers. I compare this restaurant to Twin Peaks a lot because I believe that Richard was approached to do a theme restaurant at the time he was working with Twin Peaks in a promotion. More over, recently he acquired former Twin Peaks locations in central Texas. I don't know if Twin Peaks operates his restaurants behind the screen. This isn't a breastaurant, a la Twin Peaks though. There's a small memorabilia shop in the corner.

The food is creative, simple and the bar is nice. It is also a great open space and the design is pretty nice. It is rustic as its name says. Good beers and occasionally a nice band playing in the background.Service can be at the speed of a bar more than that of a restaurant at busy times. Sometimes you have to chase on the server for a missing drink or order. Sometimes it is just fine.

In many other locations too. New York and Las Vegas are much better than the one in Miami Beach. The service was terribly slow. Inattentive, and your servers are not enthused. They'll behave a little better with bigger groups for tips, but they'll miss an order, forget about light soy sauce, etc. They'll bring items in a stepped fashion but missing what others want.The restaurant was really nice at the beginning, now it is starting to look worn. With other better sushi options in Miami Beach or in greater Miami, I make it my best to avoid this Sushi Samba location. As to the food, it is hit or miss. Sometimes fish will taste fresh, sometimes it will taste very fishy and mushy. The rice is American style sushi roll rice, not that of an a true Japanese grade omakase place, it was fun at the beginning but even the hostess was unfriendly last time. Try Sushi Samba elsewhere.

It is less expensive than other Peruvian restaurants and it sticks to the basics.For corvina ceviche, papas a la huancaina and choclo you really are in good hands here. I'm not so sure as to chinese fusion, I've had it and it has been wonderful and at other times it hasn't, but for basic ceviche this is really good. They also have Suspiro Limenios as dessert. Beers and piscos.

Maybe their best location.”|review_483059892|I have eaten in a good number of Sushi Siams in Miami. This location turned out to be in my opinion their best yet. This is not exactly a Japanese ran sushi spot (no omakase and such), it is more of a sushi roll american style place with fried rice and such. But the fish is very fresh and it tastes really good. They prepare their rice very well.They have a nice bar, and you can walk around Brickell and if you are staying close by that's a plus.

I had also stayed in that very same trip in the JW Marriott Marquis but had to change hotels due to space.In general this is a really nice JW Marriott. It is on Brickell Ave and close to many many restaurants and shops. It has a nice pool area and you can travel to many other spots from here. It shares the parking lot with a huge office building and it is comfortable for business.The amenities and furnishings are a bit dated and it could use a full refurb. If I were to choose between the two, I think I would go to this one based solely on the ability to cross the street into nice places to eat and walk around. The other JW is in downtown and it can be not as nice at night time.

Good for business travelers.”|review_483056737|I stayed in this hotel while attending some meetings in Miami. This JW Marriott hotel is much more modern than the JW Marriott just across the Miami River in Brickell.The rooms are really nice and it offers great amenities and a really nice swimming pool and a basketball court. It doesn't have a great view of the ocean as it's lodged in a corner where other buildings block the view, and the swimming pool doesn't have all day sunshine, but it is a nice hotel.I'm not sure that it is a vacation option, as downtown is not that great in the weekends, but it is close to the bridge to Miami Beach. There are a few downtown restaurants, few open on the weekend. Parking is extra and it can be hectic at rush hour.It is a JW property and the service is supposed to excel ordinary Marriott properties. I'm not sure that it has as good service at the older JW in Brickell. Maybe just more experienced personnel there.

The menu offered is authentic Peruvian food for those guessing if it is not. The appetizers and entrees are actually Peruvian recipes. The execution however is naturally not as good as in Peru due to the lack of ingredients.They have no choclo (Peruvian corn), and their ceviches although quite good, are made with corvina that doesn't really taste that good. In Peru corvinas are fresh and thick, here the cut pieces of the fish used maybe fresh, but not thick.Now the food tastes ok. I think that the La Mar is probably a better option in Panama, but for pricing and location, Mar de Grau is a great option.Service is courteous, and not fancy.

Well designed.”|review_482962152|To see a city of this magnitude you have to go to the skies. Especially with all the skyscrapers in the city it is nice that the tradition of seeing it from atop is not lost. The experience at the Top of The Rock is not limited to simply getting into an elevator and climbing whatever number of floors to see an awesome view. But it also explains much of the development of the city and Rockefeller Center. The views are simply astounding and truthfully in my opinion better than those of the Empire State because of the space available to do so, the open air and the views of Central Park.

You can visit this museum in the Hudson banks west of hell's kitchen. Basically it is a decommissioned aircraft carrier where you can go about and see how life occurred while at sea serving in this huge ship. There are a great number of fighter planes from all eras, surveillance air craft and more. On the dock you can see even more planes, a submarine that you can enter and in the back a hangar where a decommissioned space shuttle is at. You can't enter the shuttle sadly, but there are stairs so that you can see its cabin from the outside.It has a small cafeteria and a museum shop. It makes for a nice visit on a sunny day.
SuitcaseLawyer|D746D2820F740E0854BD91D55F4D2C7B|Restaurant|New York City: Dos Caminos|2| “Disappointing, food is glorified Tex Mex, busy and slow service.”|review_482769363|I was happy to see a Mexican restaurant pop up in Times Square. Given the great authentic Mexican restaurants in the NYC area I thought this was finally coming to Times Square with Dos Caminos. Unfortunately it just turned out to be a higher end Chili's of sorts. All they had to do was offer uncomplicated meals from restaurants like Tacombi, La Esquina, Cosme, Mesa Coyoacan, Los Tacos No. 1, or Toloache, etc., but no. The restaurant does serve up street corn, and some enchiladas. The drink menu does have some nice creativity, but for the investment they made, and the location they are in, the taste misses the mark and the service tries its best, but it isn't very good. The cantina has a view to Times Square but you have to travel all the way in and it is somewhat cornered. Of course it is full of people asking for American style Margaritas. Service is slow, and when you ask questions they don't really know their menu well. The menu shows promising authentic Mexican dishes until they arrive. Some of the names are even mismatched, in Mexico a Baja taco is fish, here it is beef. An Arabe taco is beef, cheese in a shawarma style bread, here it is pork (which would really NEVER be arabic). It's like they just threw names of Mexican dishes and made up what they were supposed to be.Prices are expensive and its loud with non Mexican music, but rather salsa. Maybe for someone looking for something better than Tex Mex this is fine, but at its pricing, and location, they would've done so much better it they tended to a better palate and a more authentic cuisine. Any of the authentic restaurants I mentioned in the initial paragraph defeat this restaurant hands down. Any of them. I won't be going back.

Beautiful theater!”|review_482767748|I went to see Sunday in the Park with George, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Sean Leonard and Analee Ashford. It was a great musical and I thought it was a great homage to Georges Seurat as well as to the reopening of the very beautiful theater.The lobby has a very nice bar on one side and the seats and the interior are incredibly well done. The restoration is authentic and provides Broadway back great theater that had really been misused as a corporate events area and even as a cheap comedy showcase place (with some notable exceptions). It has a VIP area as in the West End, where you can pay to get into a nicer bar with a balcony.

Its location is unbeatable if you are being touristy. Right there in Times Square, close to everything in the Theater District and it has two good restaurants and a nice lounge bar.It gives you a W hotel experience of anything anytime. In fact they gave me a good upgrade to a nice corner room with a great view once.What I didn't like may not really be its management's fault in whole. The rooms are really nicely appointed in the W fashion, but somehow the furniture and appointments seem a bit abused. I feel like too many of its guests see this hotel as a "party" venue and don't even care to sleep. On weekend stays the noise from other rooms was noticeable as was the yelling in the corridors. I called and they sent security. They do have controlled elevators that require room keys to operate to room floors but maybe an extra effort would be to disallow guest rooms with far more occupants than permitted. One night I really couldn't sleep because of the fastidious yelling in the room next door. Security would come up and all and they would quiet down just to go up again ten minutes after. The cleaning lady the next day confided that the room was left a mess and that she saw multiple bags and evidence that more than 6 people has stayed there. This is a room for up to two.I'm not sure how W can avoid this, but in other stays you see some of the abuse on the furniture and the walls. The hotel is not inexpensive so there must be something they can do better.The bottom restaurants are OK but not necessarily great. The sushi place is nice but the Tex Mex isn't a winner in my opinion, at least not as an authentic Mexican place. There are far better less expensive authentic Mexican restaurants in the city. Now the lounge bar can be fun at nights, but snacks and food there are simply not the best.If you are going with your family, I suggest you try elsewhere. I'll stay at this W again but at lower prices than what it is usually advertised for. It's small, and doesn't really have a bunch of amenities as other Ws I've visited.Service is really courteous but slow. It is awful to get into the hotel and find that your room is simply not ready.

Right on 47 Street towards the West, from the corner of the W hotel on Times Square you'll easily find this bar/restaurant.I admit I have never been here with the intention to eat, but rather for beers and appetizers. But after a while the idea grew on me and I ended upordering a great salad from the dinner menu at it was good. There are some Italian dishes and all american dishes like mac 'n cheese. The beer selection is extensive and they include Yuengling, (sadly an ancient beer I have ceased to ever buy again until the current owner steps away, he's a racist jerk), but just to illustrate how extensive their beer collection is. It is open late, you can come here after dining elsewhere. It is fun and I try to at least have a beer here when possible. Calamari and buffalo wings never fail. Service is a bit slow in the bar stools at times, the bartender was fine, I think they need more servers.

It's cozy and for small groups.”|review_482751297|I try to make going to Babbo every time I'm in New York. The restaurant is in my opinion mistaken as a luxurious, table linen affair, when it is more of a quirky, fun, cozy, intimate restaurant though its pricing is on the higher side. I think this mistaken perception affects some of the reviews as it may provide an incorrect expectation.This restaurant is inside a small space with an odd layout, but the feel is tantamount to dining at a close friend's home. There's a small bar at the entrance and the first service table is just behind the hostess' pedestal. It kind of reads as an Italian restaurant, but is much more than that. It is a modern fusion restaurant with certainly some very good pasta dishes. It has great drinks, appetizers, entrees and desserts. Al carefully cultivated from an award winning chef.This restaurant allows you to enjoy conversations with friends. It is fancy, but I'd say not a dark suit place. A blazer jacket and a nice button up shirt with nice shoes should do it.The service I've had has always been really good. Sometimes they are really busy and they may take longer, but nothing major.

Best cheesecake ever!”|review_482129593|I am a client and an advocate of these restaurants. The last of its kind due to its great service and commitment to put its traditions of good ingredients in its dishes. This diner is smaller than the one in Times Square, or the layout is different. It is an older diner, but the service and the food are outstanding. The prices are very very reasonable and I can't think of anyone eating at Junior's and not leaving fully satisfied.I am a fan of the turkey Reuben and of course their cheesecake which I admittedly order sugar free.

It is in a small shopping center on McKinney close to downtown. It offers chef grade sushi and appetizers. It was founded by a former Nobu chef whom is originally from Tokyo and is extensively trained and experienced in the best restaurants out there.I tried rolls, fresh fish, soups and appetizers and I am always glad I did.It has limited hours and it is small. It is usually full to the brim so be sure to reserve a spot.It isn't as expensive as Uchi, but it is just as good in my opinion in the item per item comparison. Uchi has a broader menu and many extravagant dishes that you may not find here, but Yutaka's intentions of fulfilling a great authentic Japanese restaurant here are fully met!Don't ask for light soy sauce and don't dunk sushi in soy. This is not that kid of place. Food comes out great as is.

It is primarily an all-day breakfast diner, with sandwiches, salads and soups.

It was Thanksgiving so I would've thought it was going to be hectic, it wasn't. The cocktail menu was actually very well done. I asked for a Pisco Sour and I have to say that it is very difficult to find such a good one outside of Peru or South America. It tasted great!Appetizers were nice, decent. The restaurant is carefully crafted to give you a very different experience when you are in Disneyland/California Adventure. Many people say it tastes better than the private club in Disneyland. I highly recommend it. Do make reservations if you intend to dine upstairs.

Older layout but well maintained.”|review_481706508|I had a good experience in this hotel. I arrived when it wasn't full and with my Marriott Rewards membership they gave me a good upgrade to a nice suite. The hotel's layout is not modern, the ceiling height is not what many new hotels have, and the bathrooms are the older type of tub/shower combinations and aren't spacious. But the furniture and upkeep of the place is really good. Beds are comfortable, they have good TVs and good programming. Internet wasn't a hassle but without membership it does cost. It is a residence inn so it does have a laundry facility for guests. Your room has a kitchenette a good size fridge and mine had a nice breakfast bar, coffee machine, etc. A good sofa and a nice view of Six Ave.The best part of this hotel is the location. You are within steps of Times Square, but you are not tied in the bustle and hustle of the hotels in that area. You are very close to Bryant Park and you can move quite easily within the city from this location and it isn't loud at night. It isn't a newer designed hotel, but it worked just fine.The lobby is on the bottom floor, the lounge is a floor above.

It doesn't have a huge amount of amenities, but the breakfast area is acceptable. There's a small gym in the basement too. You can catch a nice view with good weather in the very top of the building as the elevator allows you to climb atop the roof.The street is on can be a bit dark and lonely at night as I recall there was a male strip joint almost next door. You can walk to Times Square easy from here, but you are very close to Port Authority Bus Station. There's a lot of foot traffic.I'd say the rooms are nice, initially the had NO double beds so it was awful if you wanted to use it with people you don't want to share a bed with. Now it does but in very limited rooms. It can be expensive in peak months, not worth over $250 a night in my opinion.Elevator wait times is a mess here. There is no service elevators and more than once we had service personnel block elevators at their convenience. Told the manager that that was wrong. They couldn't care less. Downstairs is no problem, but after a long day at the city try the stairs for 26 floors...Breakfast was your run of the mill Sam's Club food buffet. Quite dirty, self serve, but kind of Hunger Games attitude. Not bad as a Starwood property, but unless I get a great price I can't see why stay there versus other properties.

It serves fried chicken, and sandwiches, along with starters like mac and cheese and dessert like pecan pie. It is made to look like your grandma's 1950's all metal kitchen in pastel colors. It also has indie style sodas (no coca cola or pepsi, but they do have diet soft drinks and iced tea).The chicken definitely taste quite good. Around lunch time there is some long lines, but other wise you are fine.

It is an actual pub scene and while there are servers, so at nighttime don't expect the attentiveness of that of a restaurant. It's not bad service, it's pub style service. You chat with the bartender, you get along and make conversation. Expect people to sit in your booth if there's no more space elsewhere and enjoy. At lunch or early dinner time the service is more for meals, but when it becomes party time it is like any other bar.The food was quite good, lots of actual British beer pub options like fish and chips with mushy peas. As best as can be done in the U.S. with actual British cider vinegar and condiments. The beers is perhaps the best, you can get really great British beers here. London Pride, Old Speckled Hen, Scottish and Irish ales.
SuitcaseLawyer|D746D2820F740E0854BD91D55F4D2C7B|Restaurant|New York City: Schnippers|4| “Cool retro Burger Kitchen spot, nicely designed, a notch below Shake Shack.”|review_481102759|I first went to this restaurant when it had barely opened. It's in the ground level of the new New York Times building on the other side from Port Authority on Eighth Ave. Few blocks from Times Square.The menu is creative, sandwich oriented including hamburgers, fried chicken sandwiches, hot dogs, small salads, starters and soups, like mac and cheese and other items for example: fish and chips. Its quite good.It is nicely designed ala 1950's cafeteria with a clean look and sort of communal seating. It was always full when it was new. It has a lot of traffic because of its proximity to Port Authority Bus Station across the street, and the prices are good for lunch for everyone in the NYT building, and many other offices close by. Many tourists and theater goers also eat there. In fact a few Broadway actors make it a point to be there quite often.As to flavors, its a hit or miss. There really isn't anything above the chart. It does taste unique, and it's not a common tasting hamburger but when compared to Shake Shack unfortunately it simply isn't as good. I hope it was.In fact many people come here simply because they don't want to wait in line at the Shake Shack up the street.They have other four other locations and I would recommend to try the others. One huge issue with this specific location is that lately it is very unkempt. Tables are used and dirty, the floors are dirty and sticky, the side rails of the windows are littered. The bus station traffic simply leaves it filthy and they can't seem to catch up. The service is a bit is not enthused to be there. They hardly smile and the condiment island is usually messy.They have the traffic and the clientele due to location, but they simply don't keep it clean enough.
SuitcaseLawyer|D746D2820F740E0854BD91D55F4D2C7B|Restaurant|Los Angeles: Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill|4| “Better than average, sadly not as good as the one in New York City.”|review_480391497|Comparisons suck, but when you are dealing with a known brand (though Blue Ribbon Sushi in New York doesn't even have an outdoor sign), you kind of expect an actual replica of the restaurant you know elsewhere.In this case I was really happy to learn that Blue Ribbon Sushi was opening a restaurant in The Grove. I love sushi, it's probably the best food for me and I strive to look for great sushi places. A few years ago I had a lunch meeting at the Blue Ribbon Sushi on Sullivan street in New York. It's a very small restaurant with a delicious outcome. It isn't cheap by any means, but the quality is above and beyond.In its Los Angeles incarnation the first thing that you notice is that it has a huge sign and that it is in (a certainly very nice) shopping center. The "word of mouth" stigma associated with the one on Sullivan Street is non existent here. I guess they have every right to brandish their name in a new market.The restaurant is beautiful, it is nicely located withing the Grove, you can chose to sit inside or outside, and the service is courteous and attentive, not as much as in New York, but it is nice. The one in New York is much smaller and in a basement actually.I ordered two sushi rolls, a soup and an appetizer. They were good but I felt that the food was much better in New York. I've always have had much better sushi in L.A. This was the exception. Honestly, this is a good place before a movie, or to come with your family, kids, etc. It is higher end sushi but it isn't even as good as what you can get in a Sugarfish. In my experience, it simply is not.Service was courteous, but not prompt. They gave me a menu and I almost walked out because no one would came to take my order. Rolls were served before the soup. Waitress was nice and apologized. No disrespect is meant, but if you see soy sauce from vendor bottles and not restaurant jugs (though a great sushi restaurant does not need anymore soy sauce), it isn't a great sushi in my experience. This one I think is simply not as good as it is in New York. Not for that price in L.A. for sure.
SuitcaseLawyer|D746D2820F740E0854BD91D55F4D2C7B|Attractions|New York City: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|5| “Roald Dahl! The Golden Ticket of Broadway! Amazing stage design, special effects, success!”|review_479015382|I really like Roald Dahl's books, I think that they have something for every stage in your life even if they kind of mask as children's stories. I was able to see this show in previews and I thought I had seen this very same show in London twice yet it appears I saw a lot of it different from its London incarnation. For starters the stage design and special effects is outstanding but quite different. Magic has a lot to do with this show so you will not miss out on anything but I'm torn as to some of the effects in London in my opinion were a bit better, but nothing to call this version better or worse, they're pretty different. Why they reworked it so much for Broadway is baffling to me as I thought it was great already. It's a great show, just a different one.Christian Borle as Willy Wonka is well suited, he is Broadway royalty and performs to the nines. I think Jackie Hoffman as Mrs. Tevea is the best (in any role really). The young boy playing Charlie Bucket did a great job, he was really good, perhaps as good as his latter Charlies in the London run.I did however spot some obvious differences from the London show. Many songs were changed, the story line adjusted, and most importantly the other "children" in the cast weren't real children, but young adults. I guess it is hard to do a show with kids, but seeing the success that Matilda, Billy Elliot and School of Rock have made, I have my doubts as to why (other than money maybe), they chose not to cast children as in London. Seeing Charlie Bucket with the others adult actors as children kind of doesn't feel right.I won't comment much more because I think a lot of it is a surprise, and yes there are Oompa Loompas. If you saw the show in London, this is really something else. Very good, but different.

The food is good and the variety of beers is simply awesome.It's location is quite nice, and the reception is a top portion of the bar covered in beer coasters in an artful manner.This pub is quite nice, it is always lively. It can be a little loud and at times of the day you'll only be able to be there standing up. But it is a nice pub to visit, and it is very clean. The cobblestone street where it is gives it a nicer appeal too.
SuitcaseLawyer|D746D2820F740E0854BD91D55F4D2C7B|Attractions|London: Matilda the Musical|5| “Magical!! Roald Dahl's greatest book brought to life, amazing talented children cast!”|review_478985900|Roald Dahl is one of my favorite authors. He makes you think, he doesn't give you rosy stories but intrigues you with familiar childhood experiences, he embraces your inner child without any sugar coating (though maybe with a little chocolate). I was able to see this show in London with a nephew, wanting to see how Tim Minchin would adapt this book to a musical.One huge part of this show is that it actually cast a lot of children whom perform professionally and superbly live. They interact with adult characters as in the parents and Mrs. Trunchbull as well as with other characters. But it concentrates on the main character whom is a 7/8 year old little actress. The music, stage design, choreography and rhythm is very well done. This is a modern show for West End standards, but somehow the surreal proposition of Roald Dahl's story seems less so when embodied in these brilliant actors. You actually relate to characters and experiences as a child or as a grown up.The show isn't light, but it doesn't feel heavy. It has won a lot of awards worldwide and you should see it when possible!

Nice local place!”|review_478967891|As a Soprano's fan I had to make the commute once when I was traveling from the city to Albany. It is not far from Newark airport, just a bit to the north east. The restaurant is actually kind of like an old school candy and malt shop. Lot's of cakes and ice creams at the front with a smaller dining area in the back.It does look its age, like from the 1950's. It isn't fancy, but it is clean and the service was really courteous and prompt. I ordered a turkey burger with cheese, a nice serving of onion rings and a soda. The turkey burger wasn't spectacular but it was good. The onion rings were nice actually. The prices were quite inexpensive too. I had a coffee and it was kind of what you would have in old school Denny's. Lot's of people came in and also had a nice meal. The Sopranos family table was always full. They do have a jukebox table selector on that table as a prop. It doesn't really work, but it does pay homage to the show and of course of its now sadly deceased star.I'd probably go again if it was to show it to someone else. I'd hope they'd venture a bit into somewhat making it more of a Soprano's themed place without losing authenticity. Maybe some Demeo's Family Spaghetti? or Chicken Wings ala Bada Bing!, Junior's meatloaf sandwich? Nice vintage logo t-shirts and mugs? Just a thought.Anyway don't miss it if you can.

A must!”|review_478946779|I always wanted to go to Liverpool so on an extended trip to London I rented a nice car and drive up. I was mesmerized at the beauty of the city and the kindness of the people there. Naturally visiting my icons' sites was in mind so I headed for The Beatles Story museum.It is located in a very nice part of the city, some renovated port locks that host a variety of venues, such as restaurants, hotels, an arena, etc. And it is within walking distance from downtown Liverpool and Liverpool One. To get it you can buy tickets online or at the counter. They are date and time projected which is useful if you are planning to go on a heavy tourism date.It all begins with exhibits from the members of the band as to where they grew up and how they met. Then you begin to see where they first played, recorded, etc. It takes you through a journey of their records and lifetime events. It is well worth it as it also paints the history surrounding the times of the Beatles.It is very well set up. It isn't a phony carnival exhibit, but an actual worthy museum in its own right. Don't miss it!It features a store with museum only items for visitors.

Will be for you too!”|review_478016135|I've been three times to this awesome restaurant in Beverly Hills. It is perhaps one of the most innovative and awesome tasting places that I've ever dined in. Jose Andres takes on tech and innovative Spanish food to another level.The Bazaar is set as a dining experience, with the meal being a major but not the only part. In fact for different portions of the meal you are seated in different areas. You are seated in a beautiful lounge for pre dinner drinks and some appetizers, then you are taken to your table in the dining room, and lastly dessert is served in a dessert bar area that is also an art gallery of sorts- you can buy art there as well.You are going to eat a la "tapa" style, meaning more than one plate, and you are going to experience many different tastes.Service is a major component as is the quality and the innovative ambiance and decor. It has a huge wine inventory and you can choose awesome drinks from a wide menu.I've had a similar experience in Chicago, but I have to admit that the meal was more versed on the tech part with the flavor and satisfaction as second and third. At The Bazaar there is a perfect balance to that.I feel like giving away specific dishes is kind of robbing you from your own experience. Definitely have the Tortilla de Patatas to begin with, you'll be amazed at the flavor, same will occur with the rest!It can be expensive if you order fine wines, but it is worth it!

You can also pay in Dollars and keep your fiberglass 20 Peso bills at home.The location is nicely decorated in a sort of modern caricatured version of spots in Mexico City. It has a lot of modern art and its bar and dining room distribution is smart. You can also eat at some tables outside if the weather is nice.It offers a "comida corrida" (mid day meal, kind of a fixed menu)with several options at a great price, or you can order full size dishes from the menu. It has great starters, soups, tacos, fish, pork, chicken, beef, etc. (Look at pictures.)This isn't a Tex Mex place. Please don't go there expecting chip and salsa and yellow cheeselike goo, it doesn't wreak of garlic and there isn't salsa music blasting. This is authentic Mexican food. They do sell margaritas, but made with better ingredients and 100% agave Tequila, not the migraine causing sugar cane alcohol tainted version sold in most Tex Mex places.They also offer brunch and specials on specific dates, sometimes a trio or a Mariachi band will play. The bar is Mexico City around the corner. It isn't inexpensive but it isn't as expensive as some make it to be. This food is made with far better carefully selected ingredients that simply aren't available from a Sysco or a US Food distribution setup. These are true tortillas, sopes, etc., made with nixtamal maze flour that is fresh. It tastes very different and is what you would get in many places in Mexico.In Mexico no one orders just one dish, you are expected to share starters and begin with a soup. Mexican dinner is at mid day so portions are with that in mind. Go there, you'll like it!

This isn't an ordinary sushi restaurant. This is high dining with over the top ingredients imported from Japan and a Tokyo trained (and Japanese food advocate) supervising (and executing) chef. You must reserve before coming to Uchi, it is hard to get in without a reservation.They have three omakase versions, one vegetarian, one signature and one the chef's daily. It includes dessert. There is also a grand variety of sake (sadly they no longer offer the house sake which was the best in my opinion, something to do with importing restrictions). How to explain the menu, first of all forget about strip mall sushi restaurants, forget about whole cut rolls and mushy or pasty rice. Forget about overly fishy flavors. Think about freshness. Amazing, truly amazing rice. Lots of starters, etc. This is a sushi place where you don't need to dunk your sushi into soy sauce or spicy mayo. They taste this good from the get go.This is a great place and it provides a great experience. Do it soon!Also, the location is housed in a former Tex Mex restaurant building (a Texas historical marker by the way), opened by Nuevo Leon's own Felix Tijerina, that was incredibly redone into a majestic sushi venue.

Everytime the walk to Buckingham Palace is a great experience. Walking through the outer gates into St. James park all the way to the Palace's gates is very enjoyable, especially in good weather. Yes, you can't actually go inside when Her Majesty is at home (you can only take the tour when she is in Balmoral Castle in the summer), but you CAN enter the Royal Carriages museum within the Palace's complex. There is a lot of security as there should be, and yes you can see the Palace mostly from the outside gates. Enjoy it!

Food is good.”|review_476980769|This Italian restaurant is inside the Baan Haad Ngam Boutique Resort. It is supposed to be a higher end hotel which I admit to say it does look nice, not the highest end I've seen, but nice.The restaurant has ample signage from the street and is offered to outside guests as a good Italian restaurant in the island. In large part it is operated by staff hotel and you can tell that when it become busier they bring staff from other areas. As almost every place in Ko Samui service is friendly, but perhaps at times untrained or inexperienced. It isn't their fault, (not everyone gets to eat in hotels and restaurants so I don't measure them as they should be born with that experience), but the hotel could do a bit more to train them better and be more creative with solutions. In general the food is good when you order simple plates. Pizza was delicious, seafood pastas are nice. If you stick to that you'll have a nice restaurant experience. Prices are higher than in a stand alone restaurant, and maybe if you drift a bit away you'll find something better. For what it is meant to be, it is good enough.

It starts from Harbor Front 15th floor. You shall be surprised to note that the cable car is boarded from the 15th floor (exact floor may be different) of a building. One takes an escalator to board the cable car. The capsule of the cable car can easily house 4-6 people; but the operators give all privacy to visitors by housing them to independent capsule on basis of their own company. Maybe that during huge visitor traffic they alter their practice.The cable moves above the sea line that differentiates the Singapore from Sentosa island. The cable starts rising high while crossing the water beneath. You shall sight yachts, steamers in the waters below. One shall sight the approaching Sentosa island and the Singapore left behind. The Sentosa island is housed with several attractions and resorts. From that height one is able to see the top surface of most of the attractions. The journey is small but interesting.Now, I must make the most important fact. While returning back by the same cable car do not disembark at the Harbor front point wherefrom you had embarked the cable. Keep sitting and inform the staff their that we want to see Mount Faber point. No extra amount is charged for this additional trip. They shall allow you to continue beyond and within minutes your journey explores an extension towards Mount Faber. It is a high spot encircled with many trees. It has a small shop and an open restaurant. You can spend some time over there and then return back by embarking the cable once again.The journey shall conclude at the same place where you had started from. Good experience indeed.

Humongous in size the flower dome adores the skyline of the Marina Bay Gardens. On payment for a ticket one finds access to this man and nature made effort. The air conditioned dome is housed with flora and fauna from distant lands. The flora and fauna is such that mandates cool temperatures for survival. I would prefer to visit such place when it has less visitors inside. Although that we visited in evenings when the crowd was big. Every nook and corner mandates a click. The serenity has been sculptured through great effort to accommodate beautiful plants and flowers. Any amount of words shall not suffice to express the true experience that we gathered inside. But; let me say it again with a premonition that this place is for those that want to connect with Harmony through a visual sighting. I give this experience full marks.

Simple. Seek all guidance on phone and the call center is extremely helpful to guide upon all and any aspects related with the Duck Tour. Evenings are the best time to explore this wondrous experience.It was my first experience to aboard a vehicle with Huge tires and a boat like look. With a roaring sound the Engine started. And a sweet young Girl occupied the front space of the vehicle as our Guide. She spoke in English. Her commentary started with information upon Singapore. She informed us that around 20% land in Singapore is reclaimed land occupied from the Sea. She continued to spell interesting facts about Singapore; Like, the National sport of Singapore is Shopping... we all laughed aloud since nationals from different regions shared the same as their most favorite sport. The elevated huge vehicle started moving ahead and it moved towards Marina bay sands hotel and Marina bay Gardens. Soon it deflected off road and entered into a garden like area that had a road within. Soon we sighted the river and residential apartments on the other side of that river. The name of the river too was understood as Singapore river (to my knowledge).Our vehicle moved further towards the water and halted around 150 feet before the waters. Our guide announced that we should now get prepared to plunge into the waters and get ready to soak ourselves in waters. Each one of us became alert.The vehicle then furthered and moved towards the water and with a huge splash into waters it plunged to set itself afloat. It was very plain and simple and no water entered the vehicle. The hoax announced by our guide became another fun point. The floating vehicle was our first experience to ride a vehicle that moved on surface and water both. Our vehicle that was now a boat moved into the river beside the Marina bay gardens on one side and residential apartments on the other side. The experience was exhilarating. Our boat moved on towards the special zone that forms as the Clark quay; the one where all sky touching commercial buildings, art zoo, marina bay sands hotel and the most importantly Merlion (the lion face with a fish like bottom pouring waters) exist. This water zone encircled by all mentioned above is a place that gives you a very different experience. And we enjoyed it. But the experience lasted short. Soon our boat started moving out of the zone after covering a small entourage. Our way back was the same.Guide continued with abundant information through out the Duck Tour. It was time for another leap towards the surface and we were atop the road that had slided us into the river. We were given a small additional round on the Singapore road and then the vehicle arrived the same spot outside the Shopping Mall where from we were picked up.The total journey lasted around 60 minutes. It should have been more.

What we generally understand as ground floor is call as Level 1 at Singapore. B 1 and B 2 etc are the basement floors. Vivo city is a mall with around two basement floors and three floors atop itself. It is situated right at the top of the Harbour Front MRT station. This is also the starting point towards the Sentosa resort world. Vivo city has a very large number of shops. It has become a culmination of two different malls as One. Namely the Vivo city and Harbour shopping center. You can find almost all brands find their presence over here. This is a huge place. In case you get lost anywhere the best way to trace your route is by locating the Concierge counter that freely guides the visitors about anything and everything.There is a food court in the basement of the mall. It has a Kiosk at the 3rd floor that sells sentosa packages. We visited this place around three times during our visit. Two times to catch the Cable car and the Mono rail. I recommend this place for serious shoppers and window grazers.

The staff is highly courteous and efficient. The taste of all that we ordered was extraordinary. Especially the ROTIS were made out of pure flour and not maida. At Singapore when you order a Roti or a parantha generally they serve you with maida. But it was at Tualsi that we were offered pure Flour (atta) made rotis.The taste was highly gratifying. We tried other big names at this place but Tualsi has no comparison. In size Tualsi is merely 15% to big names whereas the taste goes Tualsi is 85% better then the leading names.For strict vegetarians that have highest sensitivity towards beef, pork, fish, egg etc. This is the THE PLACE. And i am writing all bold letters out of my own personal experience. I hope they maintain it the same way in future as well. A must visit for people like me who are generally sensitive with avoidance of non vegetarian food.

The shops are stuffed with lot of items that can cast a spell upon your pockets. They are not overpriced. The shops are mostly run by Chinese shopkeepers who are polite and guiding to all customers. Although they do not bargain but yet one is easily convinced about the value for money concept well practices in the entire market.

Right on the 56th or 57th floor the 25 to 30 % of the boat like structure is dedicated towards common viewing upon chargeable tickets. Remaining area is confined for the hotel guests in the form of restaurants and roof top swimming pool.The sky view is a habitation upon 3 towers of the Marina bay sands hotel. The view from the top can behold any turbulent mind within seconds. On one side is the Oceanic view. On the second side is the merger of Singapore river into the Ocean along with two roads flowing at the bottom. And on the third side is the mesmerizing factoring of the skyline of commercial building nestling the Singapore river Bay.Evening is the best time to visit this place. Just before the sunset you shall benefit the two worlds,namely, the view under the fading sunlight and the view of the man made exuberance that glitters as sparkling lights. It is simply beautiful to be there and witness the two faces of the same made made scenic beauty in blend with nature.I am sure you shall return with hands full of several memorable pictures and memories.

Anywhere one shall touch; shall find a magnanimous view. The place surround high voltage activity especially on Saturdays and Sundays. Art Zoo, Merlion (the water oozing lion with fish like bottom), Food courts, Live shows, Motor boats, marina bay sands hotel view, skyline of tall beautiful facade borne buildings, Duck tours (vehicles that move on road and plunge to swim in waters), laser shows, high end marina bay shopping mall, fascinating crossing bridge for walking by foot and much more.This place is very well connected with different MRT lines within Singapore.

It is so easy to move in it for a reason that adequate and conspicuous sign boards everywhere guide any visitor that knows English. It neat and clean with a high frequency. You can easily move from any end to another through this service. Study their map for a while and you become a localite.

Gardens by the bay is built upon the reclaimed land from the sea. It is situated at the brink where the Singapore river merges into the Ocean. The best way to move around in case you avoid walking is by taking a battery car ride on little payment. We attended the music and light show, that was good. But the most fascinating experience was the flower dome. It is a very huge air-conditioned glass dome that houses different kinds of flora and fauna. Trees from distant places are exhibited there. When one moves inside their is lot of harmony and joyful experience within. The experience at a ticket price but once you move inside the ticket appears cheaper. Since they have pumped in abundant resource to maintain the blissful surrounds inside the flower dome. It is beautiful experience to move around the entire Gardens of Bay.Its situation is at a very important place that sights the Marina bay sands hotel. I shall highly recommend as a must visit place for Singapore visitors. Singapore administration has truly offered their body, mind and soul to create and upkeep all facilities around this entire city and a nation. Only and only; absolute dedication to a larger goal can draw such magnificent results. Where ever you move in Singapore, everywhere one observes sheer dedication of countless Singaporean people... especially their government.

In Singapore finding a totally vegetarian food is not an easy job since egg and fish are inconsiderate items for most of the people over there. Hence it slightly becomes a problem for those that seek strictly vegetarian Indian food. This hotel is at the edge of the aforesaid facilities. You get a mini India within Singapore. The hotel staff is very cooperative. Specially the front desk and the One connect operators try their best to reach out towards the queries of the guests. The rooms are clean, the breakfast buffet has ample amount of vegetarian dishes. They need some improvements at the house keeping end. But this should not be taken as a complaint. We all have lot to improve upon.The best part of the location of this hotel is the Ferrar Park MRT Station. In Singapore if you have easy access to MRT then you can travel at absolute ease at an unimaginable low expense. This hotel is right opposite to the MRT station... and that becomes a very big advantage. I highly recommend this hotel for all those seeking vegetarian food in near proximity, easy access to MRT and a courteous staff catering a very good property.

We were there during lunch hour and someone suggested to skip all possible suggestions of restaurants around and move towards punjab university food experience.The place was thronged by students and others. The ambiance was young and full of charm. There are roughly 15-20 stalls catering eatables (mostly). Around 4-5 stalls serve thali food and others have their own delicacies ranging from chinese to Indianized fast food. We ordered around 6-7 thalis and on their apparent looks they impressed us pretty well but we were still in our holdings on the count of its cost.Today when a mineral water bottle in a restaurant is costing around 60 + tax inclusive... here we were served with all one could imagine in a wholesome north Indian lunch. Two vegetable and a dal and a curd and salad and a naan and rice... what else would one seek. Despite of the heavy crowd the deliveries were at lightening speed. We were so much engrossed into discussions of the cost of food, quantity of food, the taste that was pretty ok... that everything else appeared as secondary. There was no sitting arrangements; all going standing on round tables spread outside... some people were busy on stairs around; None bothered who was sitting where and in what posture. The freedom of university was on its full spree. We really enjoyed to be there and highly recommend you for a lunch over there during your visit to chandigarh. Only if you do not attach much frills to your likes and dislikes the place offers your with a great eating experience.

Kapal mochan temple is known to relieve one from any burden of whatsoever kind upon ones insight. The tiny temple is situated beside a Sarovar (pond) known as Brahma sarovar. It is said that Muni vyas had composed scriptures at the banks of river Saraswati that once flowed through this place.Shri Ram after eliminating Ravan had visited this place in his pushpak viman. Guru Nanak Dev ji Maharaj and Guru Gobind Singh Ji Maharaj have paid their visits to this place. Few scattered remnants of the ancient civilization are lying there as wasteful objects. The local pujari informed us that enough has already been carried away from that place by several visitors during last several years of neglect.It is said that once during ancient times a grand ritual commenced over here that was participated by Who's Who of the subtle dimension... the world of great masters and deities... It is only that you insist the local pujari that he may reveal some ancient significance. Surprisingly there is no direct road that leads to this infinitesimal looking temple. The sarovar has two parts that are divided by the main road heading towards Bilaspur. One should try to visit that part of sarovar where the hanuman mandir exists. There is a school and a gurudwara besides this spot. From here onwards the interested ones also head towards Adi Badri... a place once known as Badrinath. I have tried to locate it on the map for the convienience of the visitors. The place is easily motor-able and road is good.

The name Paonta sahib as informed was derived from the words used by Shri Guru Sahib ji Maharaj; the moment his horse stopped beside the river yamuna... Paon tika... it means the foot halted/rested. Revered Guru Sahib halted there and rest all is what thousands of visitors witness today. The Yamuna is silent and spread in the vase expanse of basin afforded to it by the nature. Just short of touching Paonta sahib it is said that Yamuna roars while rushing down towards the plains. It was informed to us that here too... the Yamuna made lot of noise before the Revered Guru Sahib was informed about the disturbance it created for the conduct of Kavi darbar (assembly of poets) held each evening. Guru Sahib ji then announced that Yamuna from now on wards shall flow on its silent course... and so it did as we can experience ourselves.We visited the Gurudwara Sahib in the evening and sat there inside for around 90-100 minutes meditating upon the silent surround intermittently hearing the Shabd routines observed by normal gurudwara schedule. We did not intend to rise but saw every one getting up and leaving around 8 pm and we too arose and stepped outside to witness the magnificent grandeur of nature. Few young boys informed us the locations where Guru Sahib ji stayed and conducted Kavi darbar.We then paid our obeisance to the weapons of our Revered Guru Sahib ji before leaving towards the Langar (prasad). The dal of langar was much more than expected every time and we were blessed to have every bit of it under the extreme grace of our Revered Guru Sahib ji Maharaj. Later we were informed that we could easily have stayed there for more time the interlude after 8 pm is for a short duration before the next satsang started... We wanted there to for more time but rushed back the next day morning conserving all memories and blissful experiences gathered during our short stay... Shall be back to absorb more of our Guru's grace...

This museum was discovered by us as one of those... It had remains, geology, history, tribal life and much more as exposition. Constructed upon two floors the museum is open to all... there was not much crowd when we visited the place. If you are at Bhubhneshwar my suggestion is that please do not miss two places, namely, Lingraj temple and Odisha state museum.

The view afforded to one single sight is so panoramic that you can cover several square kilometers within one single glance. We saw a small gate opened at the Srisailam dam that released a curbed fountain of water forming umbrella formation... It appeared as if Milk was gushing out of the flood gate of the dam. The scene was so fascinating that it forced us to stop our vehicle and get engaged into photography.One climbs down from one side of the hill down near the river bed where a bridge facilitated towards the other side and soon after that the climb starts once again. Both ways the dam remains under a continual prominent visibility. You shall enjoy to be at that place.

The one that we traveled towards was around 40 kms from Puri. We hired an independent motor boat that roars with so much engine sound; that it became discomforting after a while... really discomforting. The total trip lasted around 4-5 hours without any experience to recall at all. We were assured about sighting Dolphins but no where were Dolphins to oblige any visitor. Hundreds of motor boats were wastefully spending their sorties to sight Dolphins. Exhausted we returned after having a fatigue prone ride. I advise visitors to confirm the spot from where one embarks the chilka lake.

The resort is located on main GT road and has adequate space. The experience it contributes is average on count of the facilities exhibited here. The food was OK... in comparison to the taste we had gathered during our Jaipur visit. This place has a provision for a night stay in Swiss tents... just beside the main resort. I am not from hospitality or from rural tourism therefore cannot suggest what all should be done by promoters to add more Joyful experience for visitors...I can only express the composite experience gathered during my visit. I am hopeful that promoters shall certainly do their part to add more value to this place which hold immense potentials. I shall visit this place again...

I visited it during Lunch when alcohol serving was almost at decimated levels. The surround was quiet yet very active. The very few vegetarian dishes afforded us with a great taste of food. Mock-tails were really pushing. Me and my wife enjoyed the time spent over there. Budget wise the place is not as expensive as people may think it... Centrally located in the city and yet placed out of the bounds of traffic jams. This is an ideal place for one to steal moments out of engrossment.During Lunch hour one finds self surrounded with people from all parts of the world. Good place to visit.

If you really intend to travel into the unknown ancient past then visit this temple that dates back to times even ancient to the Jaganath Puri temple. The vibrations are very powerful. It is all stone made with the primary idol installed at a location that could be termed as lower basement.The temple has visitors through out the year. Shiva's abode is somehow could not gather the prominence that it actually beholds. Be there and find it for your self. Every single word mentioned here shall be actualized during your visit. The temple exists right in the heart of the city... amidst lanes and by lanes... yet surprising to find an ancient marvel situated over there...

The food was excellent. The ambiance was good. The architecture was fairly good. The service was to the mark. It was in closest proximity of the airport.

This is the finest location for business travelers who can afford to continue with their business engagements even to the tune of 40 minutes before the departure of their respective flight... provided they have managed a e check in.And so did i enjoy having extended my maximum time to stay with the group i had visited.

The place was quiet. I gathered all that should come from a small luxury hotel. I recommend this place for visitors to Indore.To touch the airport one need not get entangled into the hustle and bustle of the city. There is an easy access to the city ring road that takes one to the airport.

The special mention that impacted us was a visit to three large enclosures spread into acres wherein the visitors were locked in protected buses and the wild animals were freely moving at their wish.Lions in at least 3 in number were freely siding by the mud lane of their large enclosure spread into acres. It was a grand experience... rest all was like it is there in any other ordinary Zoo. If you happen to be at Bhubneshwar and can afford some time during a moderate temperature then plan your visit.

This understanding was shared with many during the lunch hour.The ambiance is just as it should be with any other good hotel but the mentioning for food is special that i made it a point to bring it to the notices of trip advisor platform. This was neither my first visit to this place nor it was the first time i had dined over there but never before came a thought to make it a mention upon trip advisor.

Although it is a modern construction yet the primary intention of the architect and promoters to retain the local heritage into its every nook and corner has well won... Being in Udaipur and at this place gave me an altogether anew-ed experience than the one i had experienced during my last visit when i had stayed beside Lake Picchola. Fateh Sagar lake is nothing less.

It is located at a magnificent location. The room sizes are reasonable. The view afforded to all rooms is perfect Ganga facing. The promoters are doing all possible to scale this property upwards. I had visited this property in 2014 but in comparison it has now scaled quite better within the last one and a half year. The only thing they miss is one overall manager who can efficiently manage the show. Rest all is in place. I shall always remain hopeful for this place on count of its location. They are improving and i have experienced it during my last visit in March 2016 along with a group of senior executives from a business corporation. We conducted classes within the premises. One good manager can turn this property to a most prized one in Rishikesh.

I started with a group of around 30 business professionals; under one of my knowledge retreats for ancient Indian wisdom and leadership development upon 'esoteric dimension of communication'. It took us around 165 minutes before we touched the base of the temple from Rishikesh. Preferably such journey should be embarked at an early hour of morning so that a comfortable return is made to ones base camp. The road is good. Merely around 20 kms of road is slightly narrow beyond dev prayag while we disembark the national highway. But everything is perfect. Any city driver can easily drive with some care.The traverse on foot is around a km but it is easy to climb since the slope is comfortable. It took us around 30 minutes to accomplish the total climb. There are roughly around 75-100 stairs just short of the top. The moment you are sighted the drums and bigules start blowing in welcome and inspiration to cover the last leg. This musical facility is an arrangement by the temple management. It encourages the fatigued climbers to sum up the last left distance. Now that you are on the top... the mesmerizing Himalayan ranges catches your existence with its invisible magnetism and one is drawn to the majesty of Himalayan pull... a silver lining shining as jewels pierces the retina of our eyes casting indelible impression upon the sub conscious... After waiting for a while we entered a small room that comprises the shakti peeth.Once entering the shakti peeth we were awed by the presence of a Shri Yantra (sacred geometry) inscribed upon a stone shaped like the back of a tortoise. How the inscription upon that Shri Yantra transpire is a matter of immense surprise to any common mind cause the place atop the Yantra is just enough to suspend a scale of around 28 inches. The time for that inscription is unknown. Shri Yantra is a great science for those who want to break the endless chain of birth and death cycle. Generally people understand that Shri Yantra is related to wealth generation whereas the actual essence transcends beyond that to the existential evolution of the being.Exclusively devoid of any ones suggestion it is deeply gathered inside that the subtle presence of those not in gross form exist around us... Only if you could silence your running thought popping machine i.e. your brain... then the awareness automatically slides towards the subtle surrounds where entities unseen playfully engage you in their blissful experiences. We meditated there and after a meditation of around just 20 minutes... repeat just 20 minutes each one wanted to remain shut. EVEN THE MOST TALKATIVE remained silent. Each one said something has engaged us deep inside.I stand no confirmation but the local priest at the temple informed us that Adi Guru Shankaracharya and Swami Ram Krishna Paramhansa had visited that place. I am quite convinced about the visit of Adi Guru Shankaracharya sinceNot many amenities are available over there hence it is advised to carry some fruits and food along with; if you are a budget traveler. We returned back to Rishikesh before the sun set. Local transportation, taxi and tempo traveler are available to people of all budget.Worth going there again and again...

The climb is tough for a cosmopolitan like me but along with the group and with several halts we climbed within an hour. Although pony ride is available but the alluring talks with my group persuaded me to climb.We had traveled here from Rishikesh that took us around 150 minutes by road whereas most visitors come from Dhanulti which is merely 5 kms from here or from Mussorie that is quite near (as i was informed).Once atop at the shrine the weather had changed its demeanor. The promise given to my group for sighting the Himalayan range eluded my assurance. And the snow fall started... the moment every one saw the snow fall... great revelation of extreme joy roared in the sky cause snow fall gave each one a better opportunity to feel and absorb the thrill than the sighting of the snow clad mountain range.It was really blissful since each participant came forward and gave me encouraging appreciations. By that time the promise made for sighting silver line had dissipated. We meditated there for an hour before the climb down that had become very slippery by now on account of the snow fall. It was joy... yet i promised myself to be back over here once again.
varchassri|6CDCA481D0C6A39890E044D74224A13C|Attractions|Rishikesh: Vashishta Gufa|5| “At the banks of Ganges exists a cave where ancient sages meditated”|review_364354066|I visited this place for the first time in my life around the year 2000. After that i have visited this place for more than 20 times and along with my groups for around 10-12 times. In the capacity of a coach/faculty for ancient Indian wisdom and leadership development; my visitors are generally senior business executives aging between 45-60. This cave is around 0.30 kms down the main highway running towards Badrinath dham. A gentle slope slides down towards the Ganges. The moment you land down a small temple and few rooms are visible that afford a silent-calm surround. You shall hardly find someone there... at times few visitors or an ashramite may be visible around. The cave is generally open and affords an unrestricted entry to all. It cannot encompass more than 5 to 7 visitors at a time since the width and its length is short. But once inside the darkness interfered with the bleak light of an oil lamp gives you an accommodation to merely adjust your seeking awareness. In case you do not find many visitors then give yourselves a treat by sitting down for a meditation in the closet created by nature... where outside sound does not contaminate the innermost tranquility.Then after that arise and go to the banks of ganges where you should walk with care through the rugged path of disarranged stones of all sizes. Its time to click. On way back to the cave again seek to pay a visit and respects to a true yogi who resides there since last more than 60 years. A sage who traveled 60 years ago from Kerala during his young age and has never went outside for any wandering. The very few sages left who remain unnoticed by the world always allured by the applauding noises and appearance remain hidden from the common world. With my experience of visiting this place i can mention that the Swami at this cave is a true Yogi. Seeks nothing from you... nothing means truly nothing... become a beneficiary by paying him obeisance for your own blissful evolution.
varchassri|6CDCA481D0C6A39890E044D74224A13C|Attractions|Rishikesh: Kunjapuri Devi Temple|5| “Do not miss the rising effulgence of the morning sun at this Shakti Peeth”|review_364349415|I have been here at least 10-12 times. I always start at 4 am in the morning. It takes around an hour from Rishikesh to be at the base of Kunja devi temple. You climb 365 stairs if you can otherwise the slope is there before you to take an easy climb. The climb takes not more than 10-12 minutes. During climb it is merely around 15 feet that appear slightly rugged with broken stones beneath that mandate a slight caution. Nothing much to worry at all.I have taken several groups atop the shrine. In the capacity of a coach and faculty of my subject ancient Indian wisdom and leadership development my visitors have been senior officers from the business world. They are 40 +, 50 + and 55 + as well. All have comfortably scaled the climb. Once you are atop the shrine affords a 360 degree panaromic view to the visitors. On the North and North west exist the snow clad silver lined Himalayan range invisible before the sunrise. On the East is the expectant sun. On the south east you can sight down below the Rishikesh city and the serpentine Ganges swirling upon its mighty tracts. On the Western side you shall find the glitter of Dehradun lights at a distance. In short you feel at the top of the world and so near to the plains.I take my groups and restrict them immediately for any sight seeing from the top... i insist them to sit down for a directed meditation upon the subtle flute music up to the moment the sun casts its first presence upon the skies towards the east. The moment i am informed about the orange cascade upon the eastern skies i start gearing myself to conclude the meditation session with my group (for their eyes are closed and mine are open to facilitate the entirety). When some intensity of oranges increases its bands on the eastern skies I make my groups now stand in invocation and welcome to the rising sun. With folded hands every one then stands facing the east and sighting the rise of the mighty sustain-er of this planet. It takes around 10 minutes for the sun to rise and unleash its entire countenance. We start chanting Gaytri mantra for 24 times and then rejoice to sight the silver lining of snow clad mountains that is visible under the beam of sun sprays. We serve tea from container carried along with, photography clicks hit all over and then we visit the shrine for couple of minutes... before disembarking the climb.Transportation wise taxi and small temp traveler are available at reasonable cost. Any hotel can facilitate that for the visitors. The tariff for such visits cannot be compared to city travel... here it is costlier because of hill ride. It is worth to be at this Shakti peeth. Meditate there otherwise your visit shall be dwarfed as a mere fun making trip.
varchassri|6CDCA481D0C6A39890E044D74224A13C|Attractions|Gujarat: Girnar Temples|5| “Had we not visited Girnar, our visits to pilgrimage places should have remained inconclusive”|review_364346081|At the behest of a family friend we planned our visit to Girnar parbat. We started at exact 0000 hours from Somnath in the middle of the night since the climb must start in the wee hours before sunset. The journey from Somnath to Girnar parbat is around 100 kms. The roads excellent and safe to travel unlike few places where one cannot travel with family at such odd hours. At around 0230 we were at Girnar base. We cosmopolitians chose to go by a Jhula... an arrangement suspended on a bamboo picked up by two men wherein the visitor has to suspend and accommodate ones own self. The climb to Girnar is 95% stairs scaling beside a hill that has very few trees that render a cover to climbers therefore people are advised to climb before the sunrise. The price for each Jhula to carry one passenger to & fro is Rs.6000/- It is a big cost but the effort put in by those that carry the load is justified. During our climb we saw few pilgrimage at the age of 60+easily climbing by foot. If one has some stamina then one can easily scale the climb... but to cosmopolitians that are 50 + i advise to take a jhula. Even two people can share one jhula by changing their ride. Which means you are on jhula for a while whereas the other person climbs by foot and after a while you get down and allow the other person comfort climb on the jhula. We hired independent jhulas for the climb.The climb has two prominent culmination. One is at the middle of the climb where exists ancient Jain temples. And another is the ultimate where exists the abode of Bhagwan Dattatreya. Our trip was confined to the 1st culmination that is in the middle of the total climb where exists the Tapasthali of Bhagwan NEEMINAATH. The jain tirthankar who was a cousin brother of Bhagwan Krishna. The story behind their life is so impressive that it moves you to your roots. I am not revealing it here; rather leaving upon the sincere seekers to explore for themselves the quest i ignited herein.I sat down in the small temple of Bhagwan NEEMINATH and was lost... just lost to worlds unknown. It took me 45-50 minutes before i could realize that i was yet having a physical body that was lying on this planet. By that time the morning prayers and incantation had started... i was drawn out from my ecstatic voyage by a lady who probably joined us much late was pushing her husband seated ahead of me to touch the appropriate page of the group incantation. I did not feel like talking... there was nothing to talk about... immersed into the stunning joyous voyage we four started moving down again... but this time it was a mixed affair between Jhula and climb down by own legs. It was around 11 in the afternoon that we had touched the base. I recommend you to go... go to the ultimate culmination if you can... go and meditate the place where Bhagwan NEMINAATH meditated during unknown times and yet the same vibrance moves around the sincere seekers that open up to explore...

The temple appears ordinary and on a small payment the pandits facilitate for a close darshan. One must be prepared (males) to wear dhotis available there for no cost... in case you opt for a close darshan. It is a Jyotirlinga and hence carries lot of religious prominence.

Dwarka is around 50 kms from this place. The ferry is bit tricky on the pretext of its cost. Independent ferry is more than 2000 rupees and in sharing it is like 100 people stuffed in one. That part managed the rest is worthy experiencing. The one single major temple we visited known as Bhet dwarka has a statue of deity that attracts your eyes. I admit i could not meditate at this shrine. Since the entire attention was engrossed into moving the locations.

For every place has something to seek in us and convey their message. There was a special and specific purpose behind our great masters to create provisions for pilgrimage. That provision was not contained to travel alone... instead the purpose of pilgrimage was created to afford every individual with an opportunity to visit the highly charged locations and open ones deeper existence before it... to facilitate the silent-powerful energy of that surround to permeate within us and accomplish all that the reasoning intellect is unable to do. But we engage into externalization of our travel to such extents that all that is invisible and silent evades the most pertinent part.I visited Dwarkadhish temple in hurry... and i admit my blunder... and i am committed deep inside that i shall certainly re visit the place again. That temple has enough to render for seekers. My short stay of hardly an hour told me about the presence of the enormity of divine grace that is present over there.You see the best way to visit such place is by giving your unsettled mind some time to settle and then explore the silent surrounds.

All times are the same for those who go to seek the invisible power of the temple but for those that seek participation in an event the Abhishek in morning and Aarti in evening carry more meaning.One should try to visit more than once in a day to feel more about the power of this shrine. I highly recommend to watch the exhibition displayed at the exit gates of the temple. The pictorial exhibition informs the way this shrine was renovated by the efforts of then Home minister Sardar Patel. In those pictures one can sight the presence of K.M.Munshi... one of the founders of our Indian constitution. If you miss this exhibition which comprises very few photos...you miss a lot.Very near to the temple exists a confluence of 3 rivers that affords a magnificent view. Take a boat and give yourselves the opportunity to sight three rivers converging into one and that one finally submerging into the sea.

Accommodation is good, food is good and reasonable for visitors with a fair budget. The only problem is the odor from the sea that especially arises after the sunset. One should always visit with advance booking that takes place online. We certainly enjoyed being there. The temple exists almost in the same compound of this resort/guest house. To sum up it is a decent-clean modern dharamshala that affords amenities and looks of a good hotel. More of such places should be encouraged at other places of pilgrimage.

The highway is a toll road. The temple is borne with magnificent surround and a powerful surround. There may not be much there to sight but there is more than imagination to feel and absorb. I feel and recommend that the visitors should seek a silent corner and sit there to meditate. The benefit of that meditation shall exceed all rest. You must engage someone at the shrine to understand the history of the place.We then started towards the beach and searched for the Samadhi of Yukteshwar giri ji maharaj... the gurudev of Swami Yogananda. It is not easy to find this place since it exists in the inner lane and is not that prominent place with the local visitors. Its only the place for those who seek to visit it at any cost. Go there and absorb the vibrations left by the great sage of recent times.The visit to chilka lake was not that encouraging. Konark temple visit was good and gave us returns for all effort made to visit it. Konark is on another route while coming back to Bhubhneshwar. You can easily commute all the places within one single day in case one starts early in the morning.

As i gathered from the web that this unique pilgrimage has a Jyotirlinga and a Shaktipeeth within the same compound... that made everything that was arduous as easy for me. It is a maximum 4 hour drive from the heart of Hyderabad city. Total journey recorded on the tachometer of the taxi was 445 kms. to & fro. The journey moves through undulating roads and a rich natural reserve forest stretching up to 80 kms. There are not many eating joints on the way hence it is advisable to carry water and food along with... in any way it does not mean that everything en route is desolate. There are other mode of transportation available such as buses by telengana transport and andhra pradesh transport... but i did not explore either of them.One can easily return the same day if one starts early in the morning around 6 am. The return is comfortably possibly by 6 pm in the evening. The taxi fare is as it prevails in any other city of our India. Indica is available between 8-9 rupees per kms with additional 300 rupees for the driver + 400 as toll etc. There are not many guest house to stay at the pilgrimage whereas there is a good guest house of Andhra pradesh tourism (aptdc.in). Online booking is easily possible at reasonable rates. There are several dharmashalas and ashrams over there but i could not explore them.The location of the pilgrimage is more than beautiful... repeat more than beautiful... you feel in a different world on the count that there exists a vast mountain range and a deep valley wherein a huge reservoir and a dam has been constructed. Adi guru Shankaracharya performed his 'Tapa' just near to the pilgrimage. People go down to the river 'Krishna' to bathe through a trolley or by walking. All is remarkable.Before leaving for this pilgrimage one should assure that their visit is not coinciding with any other festival or an auspicious day like purnima or amavasya... because on all festivals and specials days masses throng to this pilgrimage in very very large numbers. We visited a day before Ugadi, i.e. a day before the new year of Vikrami samavat. Rest is all OK.

My high appreciations for the founder and envisioner of this place... He shall be a contented man for the reason of accomplishing all that he aspired and dreamt in his own life. He is leaving behind great challenge for his successors to maintain and add more value to this place so that it outshines others on the international map. I think they have million times more scope to add. Above all this place has worth to become a place for our national pride. The premium ticket should be scaled down from 2100/- (approx) per person to something like 11-1200/- Although that they provide lunch and couple of free coupons for water, beverage and tea/coffee.

The room was big and spacious too! There is a pool which the kids really enjoyed and had a great time. We were also able to walk to the One Utama shopping center which is connected to the hotel and that was convenient as we were looking forward to watching a movie at the cinema. Probably one of the most happening malls around, which is good for my wife, but not for my wallet. Was also having tea at the hotel lounge in the afternoon and the food and staff were great! We enjoyed it! The pianist was really good and friendly too! We requested a couple of songs and he was able to play them without failing to amaze us! Not all hotels have such a good pianist! Great afternoon, thanks for providing us with a good experience! Would give you 6 stars if only I could. 100% staying here again the next time I come to KL.

We tried to ask if we can squeeze in ourselves in a room good for 6 but we are actually 9pax. They said that they wanted to offer us a great place to relax so they will not allow it, we need an extra room. We understood their part and we also realized that they were right. They have spacious rooms with television and refrigerator inside. The bathroom is clean and has enough number of toiletries for everyone to use. There is a person in charge at the gate, so even if we went home late, we still feel safe. The hotel is secured. There's also a cctv camera per floor.

Inside our room there's a ref, tv, complete toiletries and a super mini pool. However, there was a number of mosquitoes when we had a dip in the late afternoon.. The wifi is limited around the reception area and restaurant only. No wifi in our room.Overall the place was a great venue to relax, experience nature and have a quality time with your family.

One of the best things I love about SMRT is that it is connected to the Airport (Changi Airport) Moreover, it is connected to other lines, passengers do not need to tap-out and tap-in again just to go to another line. If you are a first timer, maybe you'll have a hard time if your destination requires a lot of transfers. But there are staffs who can help & passengers are approachable. They also have an App (SG MRT) that can help you reach your destination. It provides a faster route & a route that has less transfers.

From the colors to its furnishings, it was a great experience staying here. Affordable & good hotel.

Keep one full day for Universal and buy express card to beat the line - lines are really long. And the best rides could take over 2hrs of standing if you dont have express tickets. With express it will take 30 mins too. Must visit rides are Transformer, Pyramid and Alien vs predator roller coaster. In food do try burgers at american diner they are amazing.

To be specific its like 20-25 km which does not sound very far - but in hilly places it takes around 1 hour 15mins to 1hr 45 mins to reach munnar city. Also remember in munnar and thekkedy being forest area you have to return back to your hotel by 5PM. So at fort munnar you essentially have limited time to explore city and exclusively have dinner at the hotel only. But the good part is hotel does not charge a premium for that - hotel has very nominal charges and very nice staff - which makes staying here a good experience. Last point wifi is only available in lobby not in rooms.

Even lakeview room does not have a very charming lake view. Rooms are really old, and staff is really slow - they really need a house keeping 101 lesson. Worst is they have elaborate breakfast but smething basic with food is it should be warm, their complete breakfast is cold or max lukewarm. Thats why most of the ppl order fresh dosas or omelette and management should check why most of the breakfast is left even with so many ppl feasting. Overall this hotel is big but not close any 5 star its more like a 4 star room with 3 star service. One last point wifi never works :(

If you order a taxi or grab/uber, you can note the pick-up address is No. 20 Ngo Sy Lien - it is very near and easy to find. The room is very clean, not too small and not too big. All the facility (television, shower, air conditioner,...) is brand new and modern. Especially, though it is a standard room, there is a provided desktop computer inside. The bed is soft and very comfortable; it is big and fits well 1-2 adults. The toilet is clean too, there is shower and bathtub and many towels that are renewed daily. Moreover, the location is pretty convenient: nearby restaurants or food shops, Hanoi Train Station, Van Mieu - Quoc Tu Giam, Lenin Park, etc. If you enjoy going on foot with short distance, this hotel is one of best choices. The complimentary breakfast here is decent and diversified with Pho (beef or chicken - Hanoi's traditional cuisine), English breakfast and good drinks. It was so nice that I was offered free fruits for dessert in three consecutive days! Another impressive aspect is the staff! They are so hospitable, helpful and polite. I was so grateful to the man who offered to open the door and guided me to the hotel despite my late arrival at 3:00AM in the morning. Highly appreciated! I also truly appreciate the training scheme of Hotel View 2 since it ensures that all of the staff (from receptionist, cleaner, room-service staff, errand, etc..) are professional and always endeavor to satisfy their customers, even in any minor demanding request. The receptionists always ask us whether we slept tight or not the previous nights, which is characteristic of their good customer service. All in all, upon your trip to a boisterous and ancient city like Hanoi, with tidied room, state-of-the-art facility, accommodating staff, and ideal location, Hotel View 2 is highly recommended and will surely satisfy your needs. P/s The hotel has a nice aquarium with cute and "naughty" fish that are always stay energetic and overexcited once there is anyone staying closer to their "house". How lovely! :)

Though the room is merely fit for three people, but it is very clean and cozy. The wifi connection is very good despite my stay in the highest 9th floor. There is also a shower room, with beautiful shampoo, toothpaste for the guests. The staff is very nice and friendly. They are so helpful that they suggest us a lot of reasonable things, and also even help to print some documents free-of-charge that I need for my business. At the end, they also help us to arrange a taxi though my children are making noise. So sorry the hotel about that. However, the breakfast here is not attractive and delectable. The menu seems static and it bored me with three consecutive days.Anyway, I highly recommend this hotel in Nha Trang with reasonable price and the service of high-quality.

To best of my knowledge, it is pretty difficult to do business in El Nido as the standard of living is very low. After searching around, I chose this hotel as it has received most preferable comments within my budget. The room is nice with beds, wardrobe and also television, rooms with sea-view are limited. Especially it has a nice restaurant with sea view so that you can enjoy beautiful scenery of the harbour while having breakfast. However, the bad things may be the toilet and wifi connection. The toilet is small and all the facility is too old. The faucet is too rusted that it creates a super bad smell into the water. The wifi connection was too slow and it lagged all the time.Frankly, at this price, I could have found a better hotel with higher quality in major cities such as Cebu or Princessa. Anyway, as El Nido is still poor and far-flung, this stay is somehow acceptable.P/s The hotel does offer tour with 200PHP lower than other third-party tour operators. Try contacting the hotel for advance bookings.

The pension is very nice, it has five separate rooms, in which there are two big twin beds appropriate for 4-people family.. The host (and his staff) is very accommodating, helpful and friendly. He offers and assists us a lot during our stay here. Breakfast is also included in our reservations and I have to say that the meal is very decent. They have both Western and Asian cuisines with free dessert and drinks. The room is very cozy, new and super clean. The toilet is clean and convenient, but I think it is quite small so sometimes the water is flooding in the bathroom's floor.There is an adorable garden with tables for outdoor meal or BBQ in the evening. The garden is much beautiful when all rooms are built on a big fish pond in which there are a lot of fish, making the view stunning and unique.The locations is great as it is accessible to the airport, market, restaurant and pharmacy. I'm so in love with this place and will definitely recommend to any of my friends if they visit Puerto Princesa. Last not but least, the price is reasonable for such a over-standardized quality in comparison to bad hotels we lived in El Nido.Thank you Reiner (the host) again and hope to see you soon!

There is free seaweed soup and vegetables. Thought the price is a little bit high (central location), the dish is way too big. I tried on "chicken cheese" used with bread and frankly, one dish is too much for two people. The chicken is sweet and soft, whose combination with cheese is awesome. However, there is way too much onion. My budget is around 150,000VND/person which I consider to be reasonable with gigantic chicken dish, free soup, vegetables and two drinks.In terms of drinks, there are mainly juice, fizzy drinks or coffees. They also has a membership program for your accumulation of scores but I don't actually know the awards that one may get for specific scoring levels. The restaurant should therefore provide clarification on their menu.

However, it is suitable for one or two travelers only as the space is pretty small. The guest house has two parts located in two separate floors. The elevator is so slow that you have to wait for a while.On the ground floor, there are many Indians who can annoy you with their marketing or sales invitations. Also, the are Middle East foodcourts downstairs so the smell in inevitable. Above all, the location is great as it is in the center of Tsim Sha Tsui, just 5-7 minutes walk to the Star ferry or Victoria Harbour. There are nearby tourist sites that you may not want to miss, such as Garden of Stars, The Heritage 1881, Kow Loon Clock, Hong Kong Art Museum, Space Museum, etc.

However, the city is a little bit inconvenient and there are so many mosquitoes. Trekking to the top of Ella Rock is highly recommend and perhaps, it is a must-visit site if you're in Ella.The trekking is pretty laborious so it is not recommended to accompany children or seniors. Just google for the map or you may ask your hotel staff about the route but it is pretty off-the-beaten-track. There will be a small police office on the way (after the railway) so you can stop to ask the police. However, upon you arrival at the tea plantations, the routes become more and more complicated in which an assistance from a local is necessary. But remember that if you want to have local to go with you, be prepared to ask for the "fee" in advance as they may charge you unexpectedly high wage after the trip. Be careful!After all, the breathtaking view of the Rock compensates all your effort! It is stunning so don't forget to bring along a good camera. :)

zangisaac|CFAEB297E42F143AD3BEC0E0E5C57E7F|Restaurant|Ho Chi Minh City: Pizza 4P's|5| “Most decent pizza restaurant I've been to”|review_473307916|This is my favorite pizza restaurant that I always want to go to or suggest to my friends/relatives. The founders are Japanese so most dishes or pizzas are adjusted with Japanese style, which makes the cuisine much unique. Especially, to the best of my knowledge, all ingredients are directly imported from Japan so you may hardly find any similar style throughout Vietnam. My best choices are: Chicken Teriyaki Pizza, Burrata Prosciutto Margherita Pizza, Calm and the crab spaghetti. I usually do not order appetizers, since a half-half pizza, a salad and spaghetti is perhaps enough for two. As for drink, the restaurant is famous for the so-called "Ginger Ael" which consists of ginger extract, soda and sugar. This is also my favorite drink. Remarkably, the atmosphere of the restaurant is truly awesome! In Le Thanh Ton branch, they will offer you the seats near the stove - where you can watch how the pizzas are made and enjoy your meal at one. However this branch is a little small and sometimes, it makes you feel uncomfortable if you wish to have a silent space. In Southern Saigon branch, the restaurant is much cooler with a lot of tables and two spacious floors. The price is a little bit high for locals, but 200,000VND/person for a decent meal, however, I think, it is reasonable for a weekend hangout. There is some advice:+ If you want to have the meal here during rush hours (lunch time or dinner time or weekends) or go in group of more than 3 people, you should book the table in advance. In case you come to the restaurant without reservation and if they announce that there are no tables left, normally they will give you and your accompanied two free beverage vouchers for your next visit. If you wish to sit in front of the stove, remember to tell the staff when you make reservation. On some rainy days, when I decided to stop by and have meal here, the staff was so considerate that they offered me an umbrella and towels when they saw my getting wet. This is how I highly appreciate they way they make their service. + The atmosphere is suitable for both friendly handout or formal meeting. If you need private room for business meeting or networking, don't forget to tell them in advance.+ All the waiters are very active and hospitable. They are good English speakers (but no Japanese).+ There will be a parking fee in Le Thanh Ton branch. But I think it's free in Southern Saigon if you don't ask the motorbike keepers. Because the keeper remained silent about the fee until I asked him. I think, the restaurant should consider eradicating the parking fee.+ Finally, I have to say that my suggestions and reviews here are based on my personal experience and my taste. Sometimes, it depends on your taste or which dish do you choose. Some of my friends do not know how to select good meal so they do not think this is a good restaurant. Anyway, Pizza 4Ps will always serve the best part in my heart. May I also say, Saigonese culture has become more meaningful to have a cultural-adjusted culinary corner like 4Ps. Love it!

There are buildings that reflect Hong Kong's British life. Modern buildings together with ancient buildings make the city breath-taking upon your first visit. Major districts such as Causeway Bay, Wanchai, Central,... are highly recommended. The streets become crowded and crowded as the night comes.

If you visit Central Vietnam, this national park is a place you should not miss. I've visited the national park twice and each of time, there come different feeling. There are two styles for you to choose: the dry and wet tour. The two tours can also be experienced within one full day. For the dry tour, you have to climb hundreds of stairs to reach the top of the mountains and enter some caves. For the wet tour, boats will take to to an underground rivers with mysterious and dark view where there are various decent caves. As it is recognized by UNESCO, this heritage is extremely special and worth seeing. Moreover, the tickets are much reasonable and suitable for family rather than Son Doong (another wild and naked natural site in Quang Binh).

The mall is a famous department store with luxurious brands from all over the world. You can find a lot of restaurants with food of different cultures here, such as Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, or Western countries. There are free wifi spots for customers within the building. However, if you wish to try "genuine" Vietnamese food, this place may not be chosen. Vietnamese restaurants here cannot reflect true Vietnamese flavor and specialities. Last but not least, as it is a mall, food price is relatively higher than usualy outside street food or restaurant.

The price is pretty high but it's worth. The price includes breakfast, medicines (for those who suffer from seasick), drinks and tour guide. The Indian Ocean was so turbulent that some women on my boat started vomiting after just an hour being on-shore. It was lucky that I saw the whales, some dolphins and a giant sea turtle. Good cameras are advisable if you wish to take some cool photos of the animals. The trip lasted for around 5 hours. You may spend at least 2-2.5 hours before the animals appear.

The food is diversified with Asian specialty. Great location (District 1) and nice staff who is helpful and polite. My advice is you should follow the "chief recommendation" on the menu to select its most decent dish. The price is reasonable and it has membership policy.However, the restaurant is pretty crowded during weekends so you should call to book the table in advance if you wish to go in groups of more than 4 people. There is also a minor drawback in its membership policy. The restaurant offered me the membership application and promised to send me an e-mail to get the card. Three weeks later, I received no e-mail so I called back but the staff replied that the policy has now been removed and they had enacted a new one. I was a little bit disappointed then.

Besides some good points (good wifi connection, great location, around food courts,...), it is not highly recommended. 1) There are a lot of thieves who tend to steal your wallet, phone or camera. 2) Due to this street, the city's traffic jam becomes much worse. 3) If you visit other cities where walking streets are popular (Singapore, Hong Kong, KL,..), you will you that the management is very good and the streets are super clean. However, Nguyen Hue walking street is very dirty. 4) Last but not least, the price (even parking fee) around this street is super high and not reasonable - I will give review on specific food courts or services later.

The view is nice and tranquil which offers you calm in mind with the holy atmosphere. There are several ponds in the area in which the water is so clear and pure that you can even see its bottom (the fish are also big and adorable). The ancient temples harmonizes with freshly green grass, beautiful ponds making in a unique space for those who want to experience Indonesian culture.However, note that you should not wear shorts or skirts into the temple. The staff thus offers you to wear Indonesian "long skirts".

You can either book a tour to get its overview or go trekking to the mountain. As a part of Ubud get-around tour, we just stopped at Batur Mt. to have lunch and to experience this scenery. The weather is much cooler and fresher thanin Ubud at its situated in the highlands. I also had buffet lunch in a restaurant from which there was a direct view of Batur Mt. enabling me to eat lunch and enjoy the view at the same time. This is an amazing experience! If I have chance to come back Bali, I will definitely get down to the trekking to the peak during sun rise!

The staff was so rude that they did not how to reply politely to customers and sometimes, they scolded us (especially the woman receptionist). There was an error with wifi connection as only Android phones can connect but it does not work with iPhone. Last but not least, the motorbike hiring was not good as they offer low-quality bikes that usually came up with technical error during our trip. In the end, we claimed the discount on hirings but the hotel rudely disagreed.

The room is extremely clean and the facility is state-of-the-art. Wifi connection is much stronger than any other places in Bali. The location is good since we could get to sea and other recreational sites in 10 minutes walk. In general, we feel very satisfied with the room. The hotel should improve the meal as the breakfast we have is not diverse. It should have more choices for the guests.

The woman (I guess the housemaid) is very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast was also nice with omelette, fruit juice, butter and hot Sri Lanka's tea. The host was also friendly and helpful, he showed us the map to Ella's Rock whereas many other people got lost with "fake" direction.CONS: As it is situated among the hill/forest, there are few mosquitos. You should use mosquito net to prevent theme at night.

So far it is good if you stay around 1 night only.CONS: The room is not clean, not modern and not bright. The stairs are little bit dark. The toilet does not offer hot water though the outside weather is pretty cold.

The breakfast was really good lots of variety and again my kids loved it. The lobby was so beautiful with a castle and a moat filled with legos my kids didn't want to leave the lobby. The swimming pool area was small but was nice and clean. The lifts in the hotel had disco balls and there was music for kids to dance. The staff were really very helpful, professional and everyone greeted you with a smile. There was just so much for the kids to do just at the hotel it was incredible. If ur looking for a fun vacation with children there is no better place than Legoland Hotel. The Legoland Adventure and Waterpark are a stones throw away our whole family loved it definitely will love to go back.
alhasan1909|3A3ABB12433700AC6CFA706E75766590|Hotel|Sentosa Island: Resorts World Sentosa - Festive Hotel|5| “Families With children should definitely Choose The Festive”|review_467275723|Stayed at the Festive Hotel from 20th Feb to 26th Feb 2017 with my wife and two boys 6 and 2. We booked the Family deluxe, I have to say I'm really surprised with all the negative comments we had an absolute ball the room was nice and clean very spacious my boys loved the bunk bed. The sofa come bed was a bit uncomfortable but we didn't use it. The bathroom was clean and spacious our balcony was facing the festive walk and had more room than required really. Breakfast was at Hotel Micheal it was good and very busy. I think the best thing was the swimming pool area specially if ur staying with children they will love the special pools for them both my boys loved it. All in all lovely stay we recommend it every time specially if travelling with kids all the Sentosa Attractions are at walking distance. One last thing when we booked the hotel I had read some bad reviews about the staff but I have to say they were terrific incredible really very helpful absolutely loved the hospitality I think people should treat others how they wish to be treated. Thanks to everybody at the Festive we had an unforgettable vacation. Hope to see u guys soon.

It's a must see destination if you travel to India. You'd better go there in very early morning to avoid the heat and crowd.There're many spot to have a good photo with Taj Mahal, but the paradox is that ppl tend to spend time at the entrance (to hv picture with the lake and this is not a good view). Go discover the whole area and find your own favorite angle.

We ordered Dosa with cheese and butter. The flavour was so sour that we thought the powder was expired. We had no choice but left the cake after first bites.Besides, the owner seemed not friendly. When we asked him if the restaurant had a toilet, he talked something with his wife (like asked for her opinion whether it's ok for customers using their toilet) and later gave us the "No" answer.Bad experience with both food and service! Can't believe why this restaurant has such good score.

Several restaurants in India don’t provide free wifi, so this is a plus for Good Vibes Café- Food is good, there’re wide range of selection in menu, so those who can’t eat Indian food could also have a choice.- The staff are very nice and polite (some of them are kids aged 10~15). So sometimes we tip them.- Price is very reasonable.- There’re inside and outside space. The outside one is better and very suitable for dinner.

This is one of the most beautiful hostel we’ve stayed in India. The whole building looks like a studio where you can take lots of good photos haha.Advantages:- The location is very great: close to Taj Mahal!! It takes 10mins walk to the ticket office, and from there you can take electric bus for free to directly go to Taj Mahal main entrance. Besides, there’re many restaurants around Moustache Hostel. I highly recommend “Good Vibes Restaurant” which is just opposite the hostel. Food is okay and staff are very polite.- Room is clean. There’re luggage storage under each bed. Fan, light, electric socket are complimentary.- Toilet is inside each room, so you won’t need to run outside haha. Besides, toilet is large and clean.- The hall/corridor are very light, colourful and beautiful as mentioned earlier.- If you check out in late afternoon, you just need to pay half price. Our group checked-out at 6pm, so we paid for half day instead of full price. You should talk with the staff there in advance as they need to check the availability of rooms.The only drawback is that there’s no air-conditioner. It might be a concern for those coming to Agra in the hot summer. For us, it’s okay as most of the time we’re outside the room. Overall, the advantages totally outweigh the minor downside and Moustache hostel is a great choice, especially if you’re a budget traveler.

NhungNguyen811|1308488770B581E1D5D81E5812081A92|Restaurant|Ho Chi Minh City: The Coffee House|4| “Good place to read”|review_472133875|Location is very central, near the roundabout in D1. The space of this one is a bit smaller compared with other branches (the one in D7 is really large). I've tried several drinks here and found the peach tea mania is the best. The cake is just average.The thing I like abt The Coffee House is that it's suitable for self reading & working. Found that I really concentrated on reading here.I haven't had any photos of this branch, so I uploaded the one taken in D7 instead.

The restaurant served one of the best buffets in HCMC. There’re numerous choices of foods: Vietnamese (various from North to South), Japanese, Western, etc. Desserts are flavorful too. The only problem is that the restaurant is large, so it could be noisy if there’re many guests.
NhungNguyen811|1308488770B581E1D5D81E5812081A92|Attractions|Hanoi: Hoa Lo Prison|5| “An educational museum”|review_471014640|Though the prison is just 25% size as it used to be, Hoa Lo is still one of must-see site for any visitors to Hanoi. There’re numerous statues, photos and equipment displayed in the prison which help you to imagine how hard Vietnam people went through during the wars. It’s not just simply a prison museum but truly an educational site.

My friend and I could kill 10 pcs in 5 minutes. The flavor is irresistible, but the service is not satisfied. The shop is small, a bit dark and staff are not enthusiastic enough.The price is a bit higher than other shops, but if you find a good deal (can check at app hotdeal), it's fine.

The cover of "Sugar" (Maroon 5) was the worst one I've heard!!- Staff are not so friendly and they charged money right after I ordered the drink!? Why can't they wait until the end of the show?
NhungNguyen811|1308488770B581E1D5D81E5812081A92|Restaurant|Ho Chi Minh City: The 1985 Cafe|3| “Nice place but normal cake”|review_469952988|My used-to-be favorite one here is chocolate dome, but the menu has changed. As this is spring, most of cakes are about sakura which I don't really prefer.I chose the capuchino chocolate cake, but was not really into it as the outside party is soft and melty while inside is not that silky. The cake that my friend ordered seemed more delicious (chocolate with a scoop of ice-cream and several slices of strawberry). Drink is tasty in general.The sad thing is that the food menu has been removed, so there're only cakes and drinks.Location is a highlight. It's located in one of the finest streets of the city, inside an old apartment. Decoration is warm and reflects Japanese style.
NhungNguyen811|1308488770B581E1D5D81E5812081A92|Attractions|Hanoi: Temple of Literature & National University|5| “An educational site”|review_469774683|Temple of Literature is known as the 1st university in Vietnam. There're lots of stories behind each small thing in the temple, like:- In the past only the King could take the main gate, the others had to walk through the other 2 gates in the sides- The name of 2 smaller gates are "talent" and "virtue" as they are considered 2 most important characters of a man- The carp on the top of the roof - after succeeding in passing waterfall, the carp will change into dragon, which is similar to students who pass the examination would become mandarins- The stones are put in the back of turtles because turtles are symbol for longevity - successful students will be remembered forever.....There're lots of stories and if you just go by yourself, hardly could you understand and totally into this place. As this is the first university in Vietnam, before important exams, many ppl come there to pray for luck.The temple is most crowded in June-July, it's time when high school students take entrance exam to university. So should avoid this time.Oct-Nov are good time, weather is cooler. Sometimes you can see lots of university students wearing traditional "ao dai" taking photos in hereIf you're student, don't forget to bring student card for discount ticket.

If you come there on meal time/ weekends, you have to wait sometimes as tables have been reserved. The menu is various with different dishes from North to South. Highly recommend "banh xeo" (fried pancake) and the spring rolls, they are mouthwatering. The dessert called "che suong sa hot luu" is flavorful too. Price is reasonable, around $5/pax.

Just a small small shops with tables and chairs put on the pavement that you can easily find while walking in the old quarter. There're several options (meat/size type) for you to choose. The taste is excellent. Dont forget to order "tra chanh" (lemon tea) while eating, this drink is great too. It cost less than $8/person for an enormous meal.P/S:- When the silver paper turns black => ask the staff to change paper- When the heat is low => ask the staff to put more fuel- After eating, pls take a walk around old quarter, as you will feel very full haha- Your whole body will smell like BBQ after eating, so don't take a bath before enjoying the meat :))

The taste is soooo delicious and different from other restaurants. This place is small with signature "local" style. I haven't eaten here for awhile since I moved to HCMC. Though the taste is yummy, but the service was bad, the sellers acted like we were craving for food. Hope they're getting better now.

The restaurant is located in large alley with nice decoration. It wasn't too crowded at that time, so the food was served quite quick.We ordered several dishes. The taste is not so special and portion is not so big. The dessert is excellent, especially the rice wine flavored flan - one of the most delicious dessert I've tried. As it was the last day of the year and we are the last customers, the staff gave us additional tiramisu for free.That was really nice!!
NhungNguyen811|1308488770B581E1D5D81E5812081A92|Restaurant|Ho Chi Minh City: Ajisen Ramen|4| “Good ramen, but a bit expensive”|review_469514440|We came here for dinner. The restaurant is large and clean, not to mention it provides up-to-date music too. The restaurant is specialized in ramen, so don't expect to find any sushi/ shashimi or okonomiyaki here :)).The original ramen that I ordered is yummy with delicious broth and soft meat. We also tried gyoza and tofu. Both are ok, not so special.It cost around $40 for 4ppl ~ not too expensive but still think it's a bit high

Instead of coming to 52 floor with $10 fee, you can enjoy fine drink with similar expense. My friend and I had drink here last night. The taste and service are both ok. The only thing I didn't like is that the window glasses are dirty, therefore the city view wasn't as clear as I expected.

NhungNguyen811|1308488770B581E1D5D81E5812081A92|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|4| “Exciting place, but not for oldie”|review_467988657|I've been there twice. The first time was with my friend back to 2014. We went there on weekend and faced long queues for every ride. The second time was with my family last Oct. We was there on weekday, so the line is much shorter. The whole park was still great as usual. The best ride must be Transformer, we tried twice!!! The problem is that my parents were not really into these exciting rides. After two rides, they gave up and just walked around looking and eating instead. So, advice for those with oldie: - should not bring them there unless they are ready for thrilling games. - Food and drink could be expensive there, so it's better if you prepare some in advance. There're taps in every game, so just bring the empty bottle and you can take the water in the tap.- Be there on weekday to avoid the long queue- Bring hat and put on sunscreen to avoid the heat.

It takes just about 15mins walk from there to HCM mausoleum and 15mins to Hoan Kiem lake as well (but to the other side). The facilities are new and handy. The buffet breakfast is delicious, especially the "Pho". Stayed there 6-7 times and enjoyed the accommodation very much.

Only one thing if the management and staff can improve is the food which we bring can just be warmed up at zero cost. 5 dollars for warming up the food is way to high. Rest all good. Also there are many movies uploaded on the tv but if you intend to watch the same you need again shell out 10 dollars. I am sure the hotel and its owners are making a huge business not only in the rooms but the casino too.. so they should be kind enough to atleast give some freebies.

Rooms are good and clean. only one improvement the management can do if they feel like- there are no non-stick pans available in the hotel. I found it difficult cooking without a non-stick. Also when I inquired with the staff they said that there are no non-stick pans in any of the rooms. so I feel a non-stick utensil should be provided in an apartment. rest all is fine. Quest is centrally located - few minutes walk and you shall find many restaurants (including Indian Restaurants) , lake and super market (countdown). so pretty easy to pick up stuff from the super market and quiet easy to step out if you ought to eat in a restaurant.

Location of the Hotel is nice as its close to metro station also. Everything is perfect except for a lady reception we came across Ms. Yosephire - very rude, too slow to attend to each customer, completely unhelpful and unco-operaive. People travelling from India face a big problem as the flight reaches Singapore between 10.30 -11.00 a.m and by the time you are at the hotel its 12.00 p.m. So you have to wait for a good 3 hours to check-in into your room. I would request the hotel management to change the check-in and check-out timings if possible. As its too difficult to wait for 3 hours after a night journey from India. Rest all is good about the hotel and other staff. Special thanks to Ms. Sherlyn who peacefully understood our problems and immediately attended to the same. No complaints against anyone else except for the lady Ms. Yosephire - she needs to be polite whilst attending to her customers. As the Hotel including her pay package runs only on the customers who aren’t paying 273.63$ per night to take her or any of the staff's attitude but expect a polite behavior of the staff and peaceful check-in after a night long journey with a 7 year kid.

alsawo|846189A4CEFFC5304011411727D317AA|Attractions|Chennai (Madras): VGP Snow Kingdom|3| “Nice concept, but need to work out a few kinks”|review_477910217|What a nice addition to Chennai! Especially now during the hot season. However, I visited a similar establishment in Bangkok, and it was a much more enjoyable experience. There are a few things Snow Kingdom should change:1) The temperature. It should be chilly but not extremely cold. I'd read about the cold in reviews and assumed it was overblown--that the comments were coming from people from warm weather environments who weren't used to cold. Nope. I grew up with four seasons and very cold winters and found Snow Kingdom's temperatures to be far, far too cold for an enjoyable experience. 2) The timings. You can't just come and go as you please. You have to enter at a set time, and then you get to stay for only 45 minutes before being forced to leave. In Bangkok, my family enjoyed a similar establishment for hours, and if the temperature were more reasonable, we surely could have done the same here. Also, note that if you don't arrive right when a new group is going on, you may wait up to an hour with pretty much nothing to do. It's a really problematic system in a number of ways.Also, I'd suggest bringing your own winter gear if you have it. They provide a jacket, boots and gloves but no pants. Even though Snow Kingdom is pretty new, though, the gear is already really filthy..

Lots of space, and the washer/dryer in the kitchen was especially great. The rooms were modern and comfortable. Zero complaints.Location: This area is very safe, with street food vendors and restaurants right outside. Gaggan, one of the best restaurants in the world, is next door. A 10 minute walk can get you to Lumpini park, two different metro stops and a few different malls. There's a small grocery store a 2-3 minute walk away that's big enough for whatever staples you may need to stock your kitchen. (Note that this neighborhood is filled with hotels, embassies and businesses, so if authentic Bangkok is what you're looking for, this might not be the best bet.)Amenities: The rooftop pool and bar were lovely. The gym was fine. The kids play area is small but still a nice option to have. There is no kids club, but the hotel can help arrange babysitting through a local provider; we used this option and were very happy with it. Food: The buffet breakfast included in the stay was perfect! It wasn't huge, but it had everything we could have wanted. The balance between Western food and Thai/Asian food was perfect. There was plenty for both picky kids and adventurous adults. We stayed a week, and found that the dishes varied enough that we were always happy with them. There are also a few restaurants that we never visited, and room service, which was a little expensive but a nice option.
alsawo|846189A4CEFFC5304011411727D317AA|Hotel|Mahabalipuram: Radisson BLU Resort Temple Bay Mamallapuram|3| “Nice property, but service and food would keep me from coming back”|review_476019991|The pools are lovely. One is billed as the longest pool in India; it meanders throughout the property. At one end, there are some boats and inflatable hamster wheel-like contraptions you can use for a (hefty) fee. There's also a smaller infinity pool by the sea view rooms. The pools are nice and well maintained. The only issue is that there's very limited seating by them. Also note that there are no chairs or umbrellas by the beach.The property is also quite nice. It's huge with lots of trees, grass. flowers and paved paths. Be warned that you may need to walk quite far to get from one place to another, but there are sometimes golf cart buggies available to help with transport. There's a big open field near the ocean where kids can run around and play games with other kids. There is a small playground with some older metal equipment. There's a giant chess set. There are a few bikes and a rickshaw you can rent to ride around the property. There's an activity center with ping pong, air hockey and foosball. There are some hammocks near the beach. It's not quite a five-star resort, but the facilities are nice enough.The resort is also conveniently located quite close to Mamallapuram temples. Rooms, even at the lowest price point, are fairly large and modern, with a king size bed and a pull out sofa. There were definitely some pluses, and this resort has potential. However, I wouldn't come back for two main reasons: 1) service and 2) food.Hotel staff were friendly, but service was slow and unnecessarily complicated at every turn. Checking in took far too long--over 30 minutes, and then we had to return later with passports because even though they'd already photocopied them, they needed to photocopy them again. Checking out took about 45 minutes. Our room was not cleaned until dinnertime. We arrived at the Wharf right when it opened at 7 p.m., ordered immediately, and didn't get our food until 8:30 p.m. despite having a lot of young children with us and asking the staff to bring food as soon as it was ready. Some others in our party were charged quite a bit for an extra bed which turned out to just be the pull-out sofa that was already available in the room. Etc.As for food... the buffet breakfast was nothing fancy but was acceptable, but it was surprisingly difficult to find food for lunch and dinner. The Wharf is expensive, has no kids menu, and is only open during specific hours (not until after 7 p.m. for dinner), so isn't great for families with children. Water's Edge is the more casual option, but we were surprised to find no outdoor seating so you couldn't wander from the pool over for lunch--you had to change into dry clothes first. Also, we were told we couldn't order off a menu, probably because staff wanted to sell us on the more expensive buffet going on that day. After not being able to find anywhere else to eat, we returned and they reluctantly agreed to let us order a la carte. But the food we got was barely edible--salad had vegetables that were spoiled, etc. There's a very small menu (8 items) that you can order to be delivered to the pool, but there was nothing on it our kids would eat (and nothing we really wanted either, as it was all heavily fried and unhealthy), and we didn't find out about it until well into our trip because there weren't waiters wandering around taking orders or anything. It was also very hard to stay hydrated. Only two bottles of water were provided in rooms, and there was no store to easily get more. While the pools have spaces for swim up bars, they aren't staffed. It took us about 60 minutes to successfully find someone to sell us some water one time when we tried.Room service exists but the offerings are quite limited, especially if you want dinner before 8 p.m. (technically opens at 7 p.m. but expect at least an hour for delivery). There are a few restaurants in town that looked decent but almost nothing that would deliver to the resort. In short, finding food for every meal other than breakfasts was a struggle.

Don't bother waiting in line before opening ”|review_467702322|This is a truly unique zoo experience! Walking the trails, you almost feel like you're exploring a jungle rather than in a big tourist site. The tram allows you to see bigger animals and take a break from walking. The creatures of the night show was worthwhile too. We visited with 3 and 5 year olds and stayed from 7 pm til about 10:30 pm. We could have stayed even longer if it wasn't already so far past their bedtime!My only criticism is the ticket price. The cost is high for the amount of time the zoo is open, but I would probably still recommend it since it's unlike any other zoo experience.We bought tickets for the 7:15 pm opening but they actually opened up around 6:50 pm, so arrive a little early. People began waiting in line starting spring 6 pm but as far as I could tell there was never any benefit to that. Everyone got in at roughly the same time.

In one day we were able to do everything twice. It's great for young children or as a first theme park experience. For older kids wanting a lot of fast roller coasters, it might be disappointing. Our five year old could do almost everything. Our three year old could do enough. We visited midweek and there were very short lines, normally 5 or 10 minutes if we couldn't walk right on. The longest we waited was 30 minutes for Transformers. We considered the fast passes but I'm so glad we didn't pay the extra money. No need. Crowds were very manageable. Much of the park is covered so you aren't in the hot sun too much. I had never seen that at another theme park. It was great!Expect your typical overpriced theme park food and souvenirs. They say no outside food or drinks but this didn't seem to be enforced. If I had to do it again I might bring my own snacks.

Great in other cities, but skip in Singapore”|review_467700911|We have visited and loved other KidZanias. It's a great concept, but the execution is so poor in Singapore that I wish I had taken the time to read reviews in advance and realized it wasn't worth a visit. Our experience unfortunately doesn't seem to be unique. First, even though they do allegedly cap admission, the cap is way too high. Typical waits were 60 or 90 minutes which is ridiculous given the cost of admission, the typical wait times of 10 minutes or less at other KidZanias we have visited, and the fact that their target audience is young children who simply aren't able to stand in such long lines with nothing to do while they wait. I should also note that we visited on a weekday. I can't even imagine what it would be like on a weekend. We were at Universal Studios next door the previous day, and we spent much less time in lines even there!Second, despite a reduced but still hefty admission charge for 2 and 3 year olds, there are no activities they can do. There is a mediocre play area upstairs and that's it. At other KidZanias, toddlers paya similar amount and can't do everything but can do at least a few of the interactive activities. My older son was so excited to visit KidZania again, and it was so disappointing for the whole family to have spent so much money for a pretty miserable day of waiting in lines.

If you're looking for an affordable and practical hotel, this may fit the bill.Pros:-Walking distance from the metro, Burjuman mall, grocery stores and restaurants. -Walkable to most foreign embassies and consulates.-Not in a glitzy neighborhood so you get to see what life in Dubai is really all about for those who live here.-Rooftop pool, indoor jacuzzi, steam room and sauna are free for guests (but manage your expectations; they're not fancy). -Perfectly safe and mostly comfortable accommodations, although modest.Cons:-Breakfast was very mediocre with exactly the same selection every day. I usually wasn't offered coffee until I was done eating.-Quite a long metro ride from most tourist sites.-Even my non-smoking room smelled like smoke. -King bed was two twins pushed together with a very noticeable dent in the middle.-There's nothing particularly special about this hotel.

This place, however, is different. It's a bit south of the heart of Oaxaca in a grittier, off the beaten path area. It's perfectly safe, though, and you can absolutely walk there from wherever you're staying.Inside this warehouse-like building you'll find row upon row of small stalls where all sorts of local artisans are selling their goods. Textiles, shirts, a few rugs (mostly small ones -- nothing large), baskets, trinkets... most of what you'll see in the fancy shops up north can be found here for much cheaper, and you'll feel good knowing your money is going straight into the hands of the artisan responsible for your purchase. I'm not giving five stars, though, because I didn't actually buy anything. The artisans were a little too aggressive for me who likes to browse and make decisions slowly. There were also so many offerings jam packed into such small spaces that I found it hard to hone in on the sorts of things I wanted. Still, it was an interesting and worthwhile experience.

Prices, while reasonable, were higher than if you buy on the streets from artists themselves. The reason to go is if you have very specific tastes, as you'll find more variety of whatever you're looking for here than most anywhere else... rugs, textiles, pottery, trinkets, baskets, etc.

This isn't your typical tourist store, however. It does have similar products (hand woven shirts and textiles, rugs, baskets, etc.), but a tastefully curated selection of goods. Much to my surprise, prices were very reasonable. I'm only rating four stars instead of five because I wish the selection was larger. I came mostly for rugs and with only 20 or so small ones up for offer, it wasn't surprising that I didn't find just quite the right one.

If you like street food and local flavor, this is for you.”|review_382029176|You'll be surrounded by more locals than tourists, which is the sign of a great spot. Inside the market there are probably 50, maybe even 100 small stalls. Some are just shops selling chocolate or bread, but many are little restaurants with counters and communal tables where you can stop for a quick bite. Our strategy was to pick stalls with the most other customers, and that worked quite well. We went three times during our three-day stay, and we enjoyed our food here even more than that we got at fancy, more expensive restaurants. Try to Oaxacan tamales, tlayudas, hot chocolate with yema bread, anything with black mole, and much, much more! This was definitely a highlight of Oaxaca for us.

Overall, we were definitely happy given what we'd paid, although if we came back, we'd probably opt to pay a bit more and stay somewhere a little nicer.First of all, I'd assumed being by the Zocalo made this a central location. It is... kind of. The Zocalo area is bustling with street food, vendors, etc. However, the more upscale restaurants, galleries, museums and sites are about a five or ten minute walk north. Search around the Quinta Real hotel area if you want a really quaint, lovely atmosphere right in the prettiest part of the city. (However, this hotel's area is interesting for real local flavor.)Breakfast was included with our room rate, and especially considering the price, it was a pretty impressive spread. Three hot options, fruit, cereal, yogurt, granola, cottage cheese, pastries, coffee, hot chocolate, etc.Other pluses? The hotel has bikes and umbrellas that you can take out. WiFi was free and functional. The staff at the front desk was able to help us arrange a taxi driver to take us out on tours. He charged $170 pesos/hour (about $9 at the current exchange rate) which we thought was well worth it to have the freedom to go at our own pace rather than as part of a tour group.While we had a perfectly fine stay, be warned that this is a budget hotel and as such, attention to detail can be lacking. For example, I didn't realize until after I got into the shower that my room had two conditioners and no shampoo. During our three-night stay, our room was never cleaned, although I did see cleaning staff around. Think stiff, kind of scratchy blankets. Functional but not at all fancy furnishings. Etc. Noise also carries quite a bit both from the central indoor courtyard and from other rooms. If you need total quiet to sleep, this isn't your place.Still, as long as you have realistic expectations and understand that you're getting what you're paying for, this isn't a bad place.

Everyone in our group was American and the tour conducted in English. We headed off to visit a garlic farmer, a pig farmer, and two rug weaving families. I was a bit nervous about how the tour would go for my two and five year old sons, but I shouldn't have been. They loved watching the demonstrations, asking questions, and ducking off from the group to play with the women's kids and grandkids. When we stopped for lunch at a small local restaurant, the guides were very kind to arrange quesadillas for my kids rather than the mole and chile rellenos that the adults ate.There was no pressure to make a rug purchase, although some people in the group did. However, if extensive rug shopping is your priority, this isn't the best option. Budget time to head back to Teotitlan de Valle later in a taxi with a driver who can take you to a whole bunch of different shops to find exactly what you want (at a cost of only about $8/hour). However, this tour provides a rare opportunity to go behind the scenes and truly interact with locals. 100% of your tour fee goes to micro loans for the women business owners you visit.

This is a mid-range hotel. It's in fine shape but nothing special -- a little rough around the edges in parts. However, it's a perfectly fine spot for a low-key family vacation. Pros:-When we were there at least, more guests were Mexican than American, so you felt like you were actually in Mexico more so than at other resorts in the area. -We picked this hotel as it was the most affordable two-bedroom option. It was great to have a condo-like room with a full kitchen, etc.-There's a grocery store, Starbucks and other stores/restaurants a 5 minute walk away. If you're going to the condo route and want to do some of your own cooking, this is super convenience.-The beach was one of the nicer ones I've experienced in Vallarta, with waves big enough to be fun but not so big they're scary, lots of chairs not set back too far from the water, free boogie boards, a playground in the sand, etc.-My kids absolutely loved the crocodile slides!-A short walk down the beach takes you to a turtle sanctuary where you can watch baby turtles be released into the ocean.Cons:-Again, this isn't luxury. If you're expecting a beautiful hotel, this isn't it. The ambiance is just okay.-Hotel is very large so your room may be a decent walk to the beach or pool.-They keep a caged tiger on property which is sad and just kind of weird.-The kids club was only okay. It was small and kind of dirty, and the programming never appealed to our kids so we didn't really use it.-Restaurants on property are also only okay -- American prices for not great food.-Expect to pay inflated prices for other things too. For example, an art project for kids cost $25USD whereas elsewhere in Mexico (I live in Mexico) the same project costs about $1 or $2. -Aside from the crocodile slides, the pool was only okay. It was surprisingly small for such a large resort, and it could be hard to find chairs and almost impossible to find a quiet, relaxing spot.We had a fine vacation, but I doubt we'd come back.

The rooms are all unique and tastefully decorated with local flavor. Many have fireplaces. The breakfast is wonderful. The staff are friendly and helpful. We have stayed at several hotels in Tapalpa, and the ambiance and decor here is by far our favorite.However, it's about a 5-10 minute walk to the main square. We thought staying a bit away would help with noise and sleep quality, but when you factor in the roosters and other animals that live all around and wake you up early, it really isn't any quieter. The walk isn't far, but it does make it harder to pop in and out of the hotel which is a negative, especially when traveling with young kids.
alsawo|846189A4CEFFC5304011411727D317AA|Hotel|Manzanillo: Barcelo Karmina|4| “Worth it if the price is right”|review_379508104|If you're traveling all the way from the U.S. to this resort, think again. There's not much in the area (it's basically just a shipping port -- not an interesting town), and this hotel isn't big or nice enough to be a draw in and of itself. Look in Cabo, Vallarta, Cancun, etc. instead.But, if you'll be in the area anyway or have some other compelling reason to venture to Manzanillo, this is the nicest hotel you'll find in the area, and it's definitely nice enough for a good stay as long as you don't go in expecting luxury. Pool: Lots of different levels and nooks and crannies, some connecting to other pools and some not. There's one slide that my at the time 3 year old was scared of but that would be great for kids maybe 5 or 6 and up. There's waiter service by the pool as well as a bar nearby. Beach: Great beach for families with little kids! It's set in a cove so the big, scary waves you'll find elsewhere in Manzanillo aren't an issue here. That being said, if you're wanting to surf, this isn't your place. Kayaks were available free of charge.Rooms: Even the standard rooms are very large! Couch, sitting area, big tub, nice balcony. Room quality is high. Kids club: We didn't use it as it starts at age 5. Seemed okay, though. Drink quality: Not great. Think budget beers, cheap mixes for frozen drinks, no smoothies, small cups, oftentimes long lines and waits.Food quality: Okay. This is a small all-inclusive. You don't have endless dining options. There's a buffet, a restaurant by the pool, a hamburger stand by the beach and a Japanese restaurant for dinner. There may be one or two other dinner options, I don't recall, but not mean. Food was okay but nothing special. We booked for around $200/night and felt it was absolutely worth the price. I've heard the cost can be much higher at peak times, and personally I think I would have been very disappointed to have paid much more.

I think the problem is that despite giving them all our flight arrival info in advance, they just don't understand that anyone could possibly be arriving on a domestic flight, so they wait instead by international arrivals. Once they found us, service was good, but since this has happened twice to us now, I don't think I would use USA Transfers again, and I would warn against it from anyone traveling from within Mexico or a connecting within Mexico prior to your arrival in Cancun.
alsawo|846189A4CEFFC5304011411727D317AA|Hotel|Playa del Carmen: Paradisus Playa Del Carmen La Esmeralda|5| “Perfect resort for families with toddlers and preschoolers”|review_372719446|If you have toddlers and preschoolers and want a vacation that's relaxing and enjoyable for kids and parents alike, look no further--this is your spot. We visited with 2.5 and 5 year olds. We picked this resort largely because it was the nicest place we could find with a kids club that our youngest was old enough to use. The kids club did not disappoint! It's divided into two sections, both open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., and both included in your all-inclusive rate. The baby club is for ages 1 to 4. You can bring your own milk or water, but for safety reasons, they won't give your children food. They will put them down for naps, change diapers, and of course keep them entertained. They are safe in a large room with floor mats and plenty of toddler friendly toys. Some activities (like face painting, turtle feeding, etc.) are planned for the 3 and 4 year olds. Kids ages 5 and up are in a larger space with an air hockey table, computer games, arts and crafts area, snack bar, etc. Lunch and dinner are served at set times, and snacks and drinks are available all day. Nearly every hour there's an excursion outside of the club: treasure hunt, beach soccer, pinata party, rock wall climbing, pizza making, pool games, and much more. Kids club kids wear yellow jerseys when they are out on these excursions. We always felt comfortable with the sign in / sign out procedures too. Zero safety concerns. Both of our boys spent at least a few hours each day in the kids club, and both asked to go back again and again. For the kids club alone, I whole heartedly recommend this resort, but there were other great aspects too...Hotel property -- This feels like a true luxury resort without the true luxury prices. (We paid about $315/night after taxes; we found that booking on the hotel website and signing up for Melia rewards was considerably cheaper than using Expedia or the like.) If you like modern, sleek design, you will be happy. Despite how kid-friendly it is, it does not feel like your typical kid-friendly place that pays no attention to aesthetics. The resort is lovely and sprawling, with no buildings higher than three or four stories. It's a little confusing to get around at first, but you'll figure it out. The adults only section is a short walk from the family friendly section through flat cement paths and sometimes bridges. It's stroller and I would assume wheel chair friendly. Even if you stay on the family side, you have full access to the adult side too as long as your kids are in the kids club or otherwise occupied. There are little ponds integrated into the walkways with fish and turtles. My kids loved stopping to watch them!Rooms -- Immaculate. We were thrilled to be upgraded to a one-bedroom master suite, and it was enormous! Huge bathroom with large tub and double shower, kitchenette and dining area with full-sized dining room table, living area with two sofas, one of which folded out into a bed, a large balcony with a private jacuzzi, etc. Personally, if I were going to come back and splurge a bit, I would go for a room upgrade rather than Family Concierge since service was great even without this extra attention, and while you did get access to an additional pool and restaurant, I'm not convinced that would have been worth the price.Dinner options -- We are snobby about food and were worried about the quality at an all-inclusive resort, but the dinner options didn't disappoint. There's something for everyone -- Mexican, Mediterranean, Italian, Asian and more, and the quality was very high. My only complaint is about the reservation system. It was annoying to make reservations in advance as everyone assured us we must (and to have to follow up several times by email before getting a reply), especially because there were always lots of empty tables at restaurants. Seems like things would run smoothly enough if they got rid of required reservations, and then you could have appetizers at one restaurant, a main course at another, etc., as we have enjoyed doing at other all-inclusive resorts.Service -- Everywhere you turn there is someone waiting to help you. Service is friendly and top-notch. Nearly everyone spoke English. Tips are appreciated in either pesos or dollars.Pools -- On the kids side, there is a very small wading pool for babies/toddlers. There's also a larger pool with a pirate ship with a few different slides. Our five year old could touch the bottom of this pool, but just barely. He found the slides boring, but our 2.5 year old loved them. There's also a larger pool with in-pool lounge seats, a swim up bar, and a big inflated obstacle course that's probably most entertaining for kids ages six and up. Then there is the thin, winding pool around the perimeter that's the entrance point for the swim up rooms. There are more seats here, plus hot tub-like alcoves with jets (but not hot water). If you pay for Family Concierge, there's another pool you have access to with more in-pool lounge seats and nice loungers and pool beds all around. (Same on the adult side with Royal Service.) Around the regular pools, you have to get up pretty early to find a good spot. (I tried at 6:45 a.m. one day to get a bed near the pool and was already too late, although plenty of chairs were still available.) Officially the resort rules are that they will move items that have been left unattended for more than 30 minutes, but I never saw this happen. The adult side set-up is similar, although obviously without the pirate ship. Both sides have one bar and one restaurant, both of which can deliver to your poolside seat. Unfortunately all pools clothes at 7 p.m., so no nighttime lounging. Another reason to upgrade to a room with a jacuzzi on the balcony! In mid-May at least, pool water was a bit chilly in the morning but refreshing by the time the sun was fully out.Beach -- I was quite worried about the beach after reading other reviews, but rest assured, it's really fine! Is it the best beach you'll ever visit? Probably not, but it's far from the worst. The water is turquoise except really close in where some seaweed dilutes the color, but the seaweed wasn't terrible. The waves were perfect for young children -- enough to excite but not at all dangerous. The sand was white and soft. We never had trouble finding chairs. There's a bar (and waiter service) down by the beach and a grill that sets up during lunchtime. You can walk about five minutes to a cenote to see a lovely spot where freshwater mixes with the sea. There's also a playground down there too. The resort has kayaks to use for free and motorized water sports for an extra charge. Buckets and beach toys are available in the gift shop but at resort prices ($35 for the biggest bucket contraption). Admittedly, the beach is a bit of a trek (maybe 10 minutes from the kids pool area with slow moving kids), but the entire walk is scenic, through mangroves and across wooden bridges, etc.Now, onto a few things that weren't quite up to par...Room service -- Every order we placed (even for just mac and cheese) was given a 45 minute wait time, and often our order arrived even later than that. On several occasions the food was so late that we had to abandon our orders and run to get the kids a quick meal at the buffet before going off to some activity we needed to get to at a set time. The longest we waited before bailing for another option was an hour and 15 minutes. When we did manage to eat room service food, it was good! But the long and unreliable time frames really put a damper on the whole operation.Breakfast/lunch dining options -- For a kid-friendly resort, the kid-friendly dining options really weren't up to snuff. For breakfast, there's room service (see comment above about the problems there), the poolside restaurant (which doesn't open until 9 a.m. so not really an option for early rising young kids) and the buffet. We almost always ended up at the buffet, which was fine, but it was a little too fancy and stuffy for our kids' liking. The options were the same for lunch, with one or two more fairly fancy sit-down restaurants thrown in, plus the beachside grill. We tended to eat poolside for lunches, which was good for a few meals, but the menu is small and we got tired of it quickly. As I mentioned before, dinner options were vast and impressive, but some attention could be paid to breakfasts and lunches. And some things that were just okay...Spa and gym -- Both were fine, but nothing to write home about. The gym had no windows which is always a bummer, and at peak times the machines filled up. They did have some fitness classes. If you sign up for a spa treatment (including mani/pedi, etc.) you can arrive early and have access to the steam room, sauna, private hot tub, pool and lounge area -- all of which were great and made the mediocre spa treatment still worth it in my opinion.Evening shows -- Again, totally fine, but nothing amazing. There's not a designated stage or anything--they set up stage each evening outside the buffet restaurant, which can disrupt traffic a bit and make it hard for those who want to watch to find a spot. On the other hand, you can still get a taste of the performance even if you don't want to commit to settling in for the whole show. They had a magic show, mariachi night, belly dancing, divas performance, etc.Bars and coffee shop -- We didn't visit any bars other than the poolside ones so can't speak to them, but it seemed like there were plenty of options. My husband said the beer options weren't stellar unfortunately (Dos Equis being the best brand). The coffee shop was great, but I wished it had longer hours. No iced coffee break in the afternoon, sadly, as the coffee shop closes between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. This was also a little tricky because the coffee shop was the best option for finding milk for the kids, so if we needed it between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. we were sometimes out of luck. Chocolate milk was everywhere (in the kids club, in your mini fridge), but finding regular milk was more of a challenge. Room service had it, but again, you had to wait a while.In sum, though not 100% perfect (but where is?), I would absolutely recommend this resort for families of young children. I would be shocked if you could find a nicer, better option in the same price range.
alsawo|846189A4CEFFC5304011411727D317AA|Hotel|Puerto Vallarta: Marriott Puerto Vallarta Resort & Spa|4| “Lovely pool, okay beach, good food”|review_369404155|The good:Great value -- The price is right! In addition to very reasonable room rates ($110/night for us, off season though), restaurants and bars aren't crazy expensive. With current exchange rates you can easily get lunch poolside for $10 or below, an alcoholic drink for $6 or $7 and dinner entrees for $15 or less. Additionally, taxi to the airport is about $4, taxi to most restaurants downtown is about $7, etc.Lovely pool -- It's an infinity pool with a swim up bar and, while we were there at least (with hotel filled to 85% capacity according to hotel staff), plenty of front row poolside seating as long as you got out there before noon. Lots of ledges around the pool for sitting and reading a book. There's also a hot tub, but jets weren't working while we were there.Pretty good food -- Zero complaints about the buffet breakfast ($22/person) or the poolside lunches. Really good stuff, actually. Dinner experiences were more hit and miss, but still fine. I was also happy to find a deli where you could buy soda, coffee, sandwiches, bagels, etc. without too much mark up.Well located -- About a 5 minute drive to the airport, about 15 minutes from most restaurants in the romantic zone of PV, etc.The not so good:The beach -- If you are a beach person, this may not be the hotel for you. Then again, Puerto Vallarta may not be the destination for you. Waves aren't quite big enough for surfing but too big for young children to enjoy without serious adult supervision. Lots of rocks on the beach but no shells. Sand is not terribly soft. Water is not clear or even blue. Nothing too special about the ocean here.Kids club -- I have kids but they weren't with me on this trip. Still, I checked out the kids club. There's a small kids pool with a sand beach and playground, but it's pretty dumpy -- not somewhere I would personally want to spend time. The kids club staff also does activities like sand castle building contests which seemed slightly better, but if a good kids club is important to you, keep looking. Also worth noting: no slides or other such features in the swimming pool.Hotel design -- Although the main pool area is lovely, the rest of the outdoor area is a little strange. Lots of fountains and large bodies of standing water that are probably supposed to be pretty, but they aren't. An adults only pool or additional hot tubs would be a much better use of the space. In the lobby area, there are also lots of large conference rooms that take away from the beach-y feel. (Maybe this can't be avoided in a large hotel.)Gym -- It has everything you need from a hotel gym, but it's underground with minimal windows and no view. Pretty dreary.

It's also located just a block from the central plaza -- far enough away that you don't have much noise but close enough that it's easy to get back and forth quickly. Decor is traditionally Mexican. Customer service is top-notch! I made an error in my reservation, and they fixed it no problem with no penalty charge. Highly recommended!
alsawo|846189A4CEFFC5304011411727D317AA|Hotel|Cancun: The Ritz-Carlton, Cancun|3| “Fine, but nothing phenomenal”|review_296102970|Although perfectly nice, this hotel didn’t live up to the expectations set for us by the Ritz in St. Thomas. There were no real issues, but it just wasn’t anything special. Other hotels we saw near the Ritz had more impressive pools, better beach seating, etc. If we were coming back, we’d probably stay at the slightly cheaper JW Marriott, which we walked to one day and which, frankly, seemed much nicer than the Ritz.ROOMS/HOTEL: Like other Ritz Carlton hotels, this one is a little stuffy decor-wise, but perfectly nice and comfortable. All rooms have at least a small balcony looking out over the pool and beach (although the quality of the view varies by room category). The room is spacious enough. No complaints here.OTHER GUESTS: We’re in our 30s and were some of the younger guests. There were a good number of older couples as well as families with young children. The highlight of this resort for us was probably the other guests: no loud, drunken people in the pool, etc. It was a calm, relaxing environment.FOOD/DRINK: We tended to have coffee and fruit (free) from the gym after morning workouts, and then eat at the outside restaurant by the pool for lunch. Prices were inflated but not completely ridiculously so — about $20 per person for lunch. We also ordered several smoothies ($8) but walked across the street to the Oxxo (Mexican equivalent of 7-11) to get sodas since they were cheaper and we preferred bottles anyway. We had most dinners out, as did I think most others. There are a few restaurants you can walk to easily, but we rented a car and were glad we did. Our favorite in town was probably Elefanta, an Indian restaurant with a truly amazing ambiance and view. We also enjoyed Cocos & Grill for a more casual beachfront atmosphere.POOL: The pools were fine, but nothing special. The water was uncomfortably warm while we were there. We were surprised there weren’t any floats for guests to use (as there had been in St. Thomas). The highlight of the pool area is the comfortable lounge chairs that hotel staff set up for you. Also, at the Ritz in St. Thomas, every beach and pool chair had its own, individual cover for shade. Not so in Cancun.OCEAN: The ocean was a bit of a disappointment. It’s blue, but not as clear as we’d hoped due to a seaweed problem affecting the whole area at the moment — not the hotel’s fault. The beach chairs were set up a long walk away from the water, so if you were on a chair you couldn’t even see the waves. Our reference point was the Ritz in St. Thomas where you’re literally two or three feet from the water, which was beautiful. Also in St. Thomas a variety of water sports equipment was available for free: stand-up paddle boarding, windsurfing, kayaking, etc. Here in Cancun, there was none of that. We were surprised. AREA: You’re in the heart of Cancun’s hotel district. Hotels are stacked closely side by side. We enjoyed walking down the beach to have dinner at other hotels. However, we didn’t really enjoy exploring downtown Cancun area very much. It’s pretty tacky and definitely designed more for spring breakers than anyone else. We traveled south to Playa del Carmen and Tulum, and spend a day swimming in cenotes. Those were great excursions, and if I were to return, I’d probably look at staying down there instead of in Cancun (although the water down there was definitely less blue than in Cancun).
alsawo|846189A4CEFFC5304011411727D317AA|Hotel|Puerto Morelos: Excellence Riviera Cancun|4| “A good bet for couples seeking a low-key, relaxing resort”|review_296098895|We’ve traveled a lot but never to an all-inclusive resort. All in all, we were pleased with our experience at Excellence Cancun. We had a lovely, relaxing vacation and would definitely recommend this resort to couples looking for a romantic getaway. There are a few small things that keep it from being perfect (elevator not working, not enough shaded spots by the pool, hotel not enforcing their policy of not holding on to lounge chairs and pool floats when not using them, pool closing at 8 p.m., etc.), but especially given the price point, it’s still very good. This would not be an ideal hotel for groups of friends or anyone looking for nightlife, I don’t think. Here’s more:RESTAURANTS: There are usually two places open for breakfast (one large buffet and one spot with a menu), 3-4 for lunch (the large indoor buffet, a small buffet by the beach and a few order-off-the-menu spots), and 6-8 for dinner (French, Italian, Pan-Asian, Indian, Mexican, Seafood, Steak, Spanish Tapas, etc.) We’re pretty picky about food, and we had no complaints. It was really as good as you can expect for somewhere serving en masse. The breakfast and lunch buffets were huge with lots of seafood, great desserts, a good mix of Mexican and American favorites. We found the French, Italian and Pan-Asian restaurants to feel (and taste) a little too much like hotel restaurants, but the Indian and Spanish Tapas restaurants were truly great — food and setting as good as you’d find anywhere. There are no reservations anywhere, but we never had a wait. Dinner restaurants are open starting at 5:30 p.m. until 11 p.m. or so. We often had appetizers at one place, our main meal somewhere else, and dessert somewhere else. Come hungry. DRINKS: In addition to a number of normal bars (serving a good variety of tropical drinks, beers, etc.), there’s a coffee bar, a juice bar and a swim-up bar. Every day at 11 a.m. they make a drink in a coconut on the beach. If you don’t want to get up to walk to a bar, servers circulate the pool and beach areas and check in with you about every 30 minutes or so. We were happy that it seemed nearly everything available from the bar was part of the all inclusive package, but beer aficionados may be disappointed by the selection: Bud Light, Modelo, Corona and Pacifico. No craft brews or anything local to the area.POOLS: The pool by the swim-up bar is the liveliest, with music, lots of loud, tipsy people, etc. However, the lazy river pool is much quieter and more serene if that’s what you’re looking for. A note about the lazy river: it’s maybe the laziest lazy river I’ve ever encountered. It barely pushes you along, and at some points it doesn’t push you along at all. Think of it more like a normal pool in the shape of a lazy river. All along the pool there are beach chairs and day beds. However, many of them aren’t in the shade. Additionally, although you’re not supposed to reserve them, people do. Same with the pool floats. They’re supposed to stay in the water at all times, but the hotel doesn’t enforce this rule. People hoard them — hide them under beach chairs, etc. They can be hard to find when you want one. If a float is important to you, I’d suggest bringing one from home. We were very surprised to learn that the pools close for the day at 8 p.m. We would have loved to sit out in a hot tub after dinner, but alas, not allowed. We never figured out why that was.ROOMS: Rooms are large, with the biggest shower you’ve ever seen, a jet tub, a large bet, a sitting area with a love seat and a coffee table, and a large balcony. We thought about splurging for the swim-up rooms but didn’t and were very glad that we didn’t. You have a nice private day bed and hammock with those, but they’re in the hot sun the majority of the day with no shade.BEACH: Unfortunately at the the moment a seaweed problem is impacting the whole area. As a result the water is dark brown — not the clear blue waters you’re likely envisioning. The waves are very calm in this area too — definitely not a place for surfing or anything like that. We spent a few days down at the beach when we couldn’t find shaded chairs by the pool (there seemed to always be more spots available at the beach). The sand is white and soft, but the water situation is really a shame. If the ocean matters to you, and you’re not committed to vacationing in the Riviera Maya area, I’d suggest looking elsewhere until the seaweed problem passes.SERVICE/TIPPING: Hotel staff were really great, always going out of their way to help. Tips are included in your package, but additional tips are welcome when you encounter good service. Either pesos or dollars would be fine.ACTIVITIES: We did a lot more lounging around and reading books so can’t speak too much to the activities, but there was plenty going on if that’s your thing. Things like air riffle shooting, tennis, snorkeling, windsurfing, cooking classes, Spanish lessons, etc. are all included. There’s also nightly entertainment that’s cheesy but fine. A few bars are open until midnight or 1 p.m., but there’s not much nightlife. We were in bed by 10 p.m. most nights, and it seemed like everyone else was too. The spa, dinners on the beach, tequila tasting, and excursions cost extra. We traveled on our own to cenotes and to Tulum — highly recommended.OTHER GUESTS: The vast majority of other travelers were American couples on honeymoon or anniversary trips. There were some Europeans. A few older couples traveling with college age kids. A few groups of friends, but not many.OTHER: I loved that there was a bookshelf where you could leave books you’d finished and find a new book left by someone else. I didn’t like that our elevator was broken most of our stay (and even when it was fixed, it required standing just the right way for the doors to close). We got to/from the hotel using USA Transfers, which was reliable and about half the price we heard quoted by taxi drivers.

The food is more Tex-Mex than authentically Mexican (cheddar cheese and sour cream on tacos, for example), but that's not necessarily bad if that's what you're looking for. The prices were good ($10 to $15 per dish) and service fine. We found the live music a little too loud, so I'd say this place is aimed at a slightly younger crowd. Still, we were happy with the choice. It's right off the main Playa stretch.

I couldn't finish mine. Even though the Thai restaurant in the La Isla shopping complex is pretty pricey, I'd look there if you're craving Thai.

Is the food the best you'll ever have? No, but it's fine. Are the prices reasonable? Not really, but they're not too outrageous for a tourist joint ($20 or so for most entrees). So why should you come? The setting! Simply amazing! Private, secluded tables on a deck looking out at the lagoon where the sun sets. You wont be sorry.
alsawo|846189A4CEFFC5304011411727D317AA|Hotel|Isla Navidad: Grand Isla Navidad Resort|3| “Lovely pool -- everything else, just okay”|review_285908372|I think all the amazing reviews skewed our expectations. We were pretty disappointed upon first arriving, but the property did grow on us eventually.The good:The pool -- It's long and thin, starting with a shallow children's pool, and then a small slide takes you down to a deeper pool. You weave through narrow passages and under tunnels to another slide, which takes you down to the large, main pool with a swim-up bar and volleyball net. It's more interesting than a typical pool; my two and four year olds had a lot of fun going on family adventures from one end to the other. Both slides are small and slow, ideal for toddlers and preschoolers. They might be a bit boring for older kids. There are also two smaller pools tucked away elsewhere in the resort for those who want more quiet and privacy.Water taxi to Barra de Navidad -- We loved our nightly water taxi trips over to Barra de Navidad to dinner. You truly feel like you're experiencing another culture and another way of life. The water taxi picks you up at the hotel's marina and takes you two minutes or so to a dock in the small fishing village with restaurants, bars, shops, etc. It's nothing fancy, definitely an off-the-beaten-track sort of spot, but we liked it. A roundtrip ticket cost 30 pesos (about $2). Breakfast -- This was included in our package. On our first two mornings they let us order a la carte since there weren't enough people at the hotel to have a buffet. The food was good and well presented -- a good mix of American and Mexican staples. Our third morning we had the buffet -- fresh fruit, omelettes made to order, French toast, etc. No complaints.The bad:Outdated, and not in great repair -- I felt like I'd stepped into a time capsule. The decor is very 1980s, and the whole place feels like somewhere that was pretty fancy 30 or 40 years ago. Now, it's in okay shape but rough around the edges -- chipped tiles, signs for things that no longer exist, ice rooms with no ice machines, etc.Service -- Maybe it was just an off weekend because everyone else raved about the service. However, that was not our experience. Because there were no ice machines, we called several times to request ice from room service (traveling with a toddler who needed milk to stay cold), and would literally wait 45 minutes and several phone calls for someone to show up with it. We showed up to the kids club several times to find a sign saying the staff member was in a particular spot (like at the ping pong table, for instance) only to go there and find no one around. And so on.Wifi -- Wifi was included in our package, but the signal was so weak we could only connect on our balcony. I know you don't go on vacation to spent a lot of time online, but still...The neither good nor bad, but noteworthy:Target audience -- I'm not really sure who this hotel is catering to. I don't think it's selling itself to couples as we saw no sign of nightlife. But it's not particularly family-friendly either, as the water slides don't get turned on until 11 a.m.Empty -- We stayed Thursday through Sunday. On Thursday night, we literally saw one other family on the massive resort. More arrived as the weekend went on, but it was still very empty. On the one hand, we loved having the beach literally to ourselves most of the time. On the other hand, we would have loved to have used the kids club, but there were no activities since ours were virtually the only kids.The beach -- The hotel's beach in set in a cove, which feels more like a lake than the ocean. We thought gentle waters would be ideal for our small children, but this was more than just gentle -- there were literally no waves. That was too bad. Still, it was lovely... with plenty of chairs, cabanas free for everyone to use, hammocks, etc.So, there you have it.For what it's worth, we've also stayed at the Barcelo Karima Palace Deluxe and would probably go back there rather than Grand Isla Navidad if we were to return to the area, although we did like that Grand Isla Navidad felt a little more authentically Mexican and loved the water taxi to Barra de Navidad.

I'd be much more enthusiastic about this restaurant if it weren't located in a hotel, and a not terribly exciting one at that. But if you don't mind that detail this is worth the trip. You can sit outside with ocean views.

The tour leaves from Frenchtown, which is a short walk from Charlotte Amelie with parking easy to find. You save 10% if you reserve a spot online. Tours are limited to 12 people but no one else showed up so ours was private.The highlight of the tour was our guide, Sean. A recent transplant to the V.I., he knew an amazing amount about its history, flora, fauna, and contemporary culture. It was never boring as these sort of tours can be for me at times. He did a good job of keeping the information engaging, and he was perfectly willing to shift gears to other topics based on our questions and interests. He was also great about tailoring the content of our tour to us (I didn't have great shoes, so we did more kayaking that hiking for instance), although admittedly in a bigger group this sort of treatment might not be possible.The only thing I'd warn is that if your focus is snorkeling, this probably isn't he right tour for you. I enjoyed the snorkeling and saw some colorful fish, but this isn't the best spot on the islands for that. This tour is a better fit for hikers and history enthusiasts. The kayaking is fun too but definitely recreational -- serious kayakers will probably be disappointed.
alsawo|846189A4CEFFC5304011411727D317AA|Hotel|New York City: Ace Hotel New York|5| “Stamp of approval from a former New Yorker”|review_139300989|I loved this place. Really, it couldn't have been better. Let me tell you a little about where I'm coming from... I lived in NYC for five years so I'm kind of a snob about NYC. I hate tourists. I hate being a tourist. I hate all things touristy. This hotel feels authentically New York, not touristy at all. At the same time I'm also 30 and a new mom, so I'm not exactly super hip these days. From reading other reviews I was a little worried this hotel would feel too cool or too young for me. Nope, not at all. I loved it. Sure there were hipsters but there were plenty of other people too. I think my 60 year old mom would have felt comfortable here.Looking to save a bit of money I stayed in one of the mini rooms. Best decision ever. It was plenty of space. I'd feel perfectly comfortable staying there again with my husband. In fact, I'd stay in a mini room with husband and baby too as long as we weren't planning to be in the room too much. You have a bed, small desk, TV and private bathroom. The sink is part of the bedroom so it feels a little college dorm-esque, but the design is interesting and vintage-y which makes up for that.Other pluses:-Internet is included in the price of the room-There's a delicious Stumptown coffee shop on site, as well as a few restaurants that are real restaurants NYers eat at, not your usual hotel tourist traps-The lobby is a makeshift bar or coffee shop (depending on the time of day) where there will always be people hanging out on big couches and at long college library style tables. If you want to get a feel for NYC nightlife without actually participating, walking through this to get to the elevator is great-Staff were all perfectly nice and helpfulThe only downside is the location. 29th and Broadway isn't exactly happening. It's basically just office buildings, cheap jewelry stores and souvenir shops. However, it's a central location near a bunch of subways that will quickly take you to other cool neighborhoods.
alsawo|846189A4CEFFC5304011411727D317AA|Hotel|Paris: Renaissance Paris Le Parc Trocadero Hotel|4| “Perfect for a short trip to Paris”|review_137593681|I only had one day in Paris so wanted to be located somewhere that would be an easy jumping off point for major sites. A 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower (where you can load boats or buses for city tours), this was perfect. It's also an easy walk to the Champs Elysees and the Arche de Triomphe. There are plenty of little cafes, grocery stores, etc. in the neighborhood.The hotel itself is an an old classic Parisian building but outfitted with modern decor. It's nicely done. I stayed in the "larger guest room" and it seemed about normal size to me. Definitely not large, but that's Paris for you. I'd be wary of a smaller room category if you have a family or are planning to spend a lot of time in the room.My only beef is the extras. When I pay so much for a hotel I like everything to be included. However, breakfast will put you back another 29 Euro/day. Internet will put you back an extra 20 Euro/day.

This is by far the nicest spa in town. You get a robe and slippers when you enter, decor is modern, staff is friendly and well trained, etc. Pedicures are given on a balcony overlooking the sea. Only downside is the price. Expect to pay U.S. or European rates. A pedicure is about $20 USD and and hour-long massage is around $60 USD for instance. For Cotonou, these prices are kind of crazy. After a visit to the spa I like to have lunch at the bar on the roof, which has a nice view of the whole city.

Well, you can. An added perk is that the staff speak English, so this is a nice place when you need a break from French. Service is excellent all around. My only complaint is that you pay separately for rice, which drives up the prices quite a bit. Don't count on getting out of here for less than around 7000 or 8000cfa a person ($15 USD).

If you're searching for somewhere comfortable with good food that won't make you sick, this could be your spot. This is probably the #1 expat hangout in Cotonou. The pizza is especially good, but the brochettes are favorites too. Saturday night there's a buy one get one free drink special. They play sports games on a big projector too.

It's as good as any Thai food I've gotten in the U.S. or in Europe. (Admittedly I've never been to Thailand.) You can set in a nice outdoor area or inside, in air conditioning. Everything is excellence, but personal favorites are the pad thai and the dish that comes in a pineapple (there's a photo in the menu). It can get kind of pricy since you order rice separately too, but it's worth the splurge. For reference, pad thai is around 4000cfa, most main dishes are around 5000cfa (with an additional 1500cfa for rice), etc. My only complaint is the wait time. It can take up to an hour to get your food. But that's pretty standard anywhere in Cotonou.

I stayed in the cheapest room, over on the lagoon side. It was small and minimalist. It felt a bit like camping. Attention to detail was seriously lacking. The mini shampoo bottles in our room were clearly recycled from visit to visit, for instance; they were old and ratty. The room itself was dark and depressing. I'm so glad I gave Casa del Papa another chance, and that this time I sprung for the most expensive room, a privilege double which is on the ocean side. Located in a private bungalow, it was a spacious room with a high ceiling, nice wooden furniture, a private porch, etc. The difference in price was nothing for the huge difference in quality. It was so peaceful to sit on the porch and listen to the waves. We were a short walk from the pool and restaurant. We peaked in the regular double on the ocean side -- it's a half-bungalow with a shared porch. It's still better than anything on the lagoon side, but the room itself is pretty tiny and simple.
alsawo|846189A4CEFFC5304011411727D317AA|Hotel|Charles Town: Hillbrook Inn|4| “A lovely antique-filled old home with nooks and crannies galore.”|review_80088614|My husband and I shared a lovely, relaxing weekend at Hillbrook Inn in late August. Having never been to the area, I have to admit, we were a bit nervous. A European-like chateau in the middle of West Virginia? We feared something tacky and Disney-like, but that's not what we found at all. Hillbrook is a lovely more than 100-year-old Tudor home with creaky floors, nooks and crannies galore. It's filled with quirky and eclectic antiques, and the owners are accessible but not in your face. We loved it. There were a few hitches that keep me from giving it five stars, but I'd still recommend it to friends without reservation.The room: We loved our room, the Point. We were a bit nervous about it too, as it's the cheapest room available ($169), but it was perfectly fine. (In fact, we were really glad we didn't splurge for one of the more expensive suites. They're probably more spacious, but they're not part of the original house, which leads me to believe they lack some of the character we loved.) The Point isn't large, but it was certainly large enough for us. it has a full/queen bed, a decent-sized closet and a sitting area with a table and two chairs. You have to duck when you enter it through a tiny hallway, but that's part of the charm. Because it's right above the kitchen and the office, though, we could hear commotion downstairs in the morning. It didn't bother us, but if you're sensitive about noise, it might bother you. Another thing to know: no hair dryer or ironing board. Oh, and no TV either.The breakfast:Breakfast is included with your stay, which is quite a bargain. You eat whatever the chef prepares. One day we got a fruit plate and then pancakes with fresh whipped cream. Another day we got a yogurt parfait and then an omelet with sausage links. The coffee was some of the best I've had. And the breakfast room -- a solarium looking out on the grounds -- is lovely.The dinner:We decided to splurge for the $65/person five-course dinner, based mostly on the rave reviews we read on TripAdvisor. Unfortunately, we were quite disappointed with the food. The dining experience, however, was wonderful. You eat in the home's lovely dining room. Think dark wood, high ceilings, candles. It feels very romantic and intimate, and indeed it is! The night we were there, there were five tables of two and one table of five. I doubt they could ever fit more than that. The food, though, was not what I expected for $65/person. First course: a spinach-pastry something-or-other topped with a deliciously tart sauce -- the whole thing was surprising, interesting and good. No complaints about this course. Second course: a simple salad with parmesan cheese. Really? A salad? That feels like cheating. Third course: penne with a light white sauce. It was fine. And it was homemade. But a basic pasta? That's not a particularly interesting culinary experience, if you ask me. Fourth course: filet mignon with asparagus. It tasted good, but again, this isn't what we expect of a restaurant that calls itself gourmet. FIfth course: for dessert, a chocolate cake. Again, good, but gourmet? No. If we had to make the choice again, we'd eat about five minutes away in Charles Town, where there was a restaurant called Dish that looked to have similarly fresh, simple, good foods, but much cheaper.The grounds: There's enough space for a nice walk, but not enough for a run. We had a nice time lounging on a hammock. We were also very excited about the life-size chess game, but we were disappointed to realize so many pieces were missing that it was impossible to play.Stuff to do: We mostly enjoyed a lazy weekend, but we also trekked to Harper's Ferry (about 20 minutes away) and went riving tubing on the Shenandoah (about 10 minutes away).

(Let's just say that I hope they paid the photographer responsible for the photos on the website well. Very well.) However, if you are looking for somewhere homey and comfortable, with fireplaces galore and sleigh rides on site during the winter months, then keep reading.I upgraded to a room with a fireplace in it, and I'm glad I did. It was huge, and in addition to the fireplace there was also a walk-in closet/changing area, a small porch and a tiny kitchen with a coffee maker, microwave and mini-fridge. I peeked in some of the standard rooms; they were quite small. While my room was large and nice enough, let me be clear: it was not luxurious. There were some lovely touches, but there are also things like a plastic toilet seat and kitschy decorations.If you don't want to pay more for a fireplace in your room, no worries, because there's a giant living room with several cozy fireplaces for you to use. Two are even tucked away in corners, allowing for some privacy. That living room is the highlight of Stowe. It's huge, with Turkish rugs, antique-y furniture, board games, books, etc. One problem about it, though. I'll get to that in a minute.I picked Stowehof largely because it seemed to host many weddings. "If all these people are willing to spend one of the biggest days of their life here," I thought, "then it must be pretty darn nice, right?" Two things about that:1. Personally, I would never consider this place for a wedding. Rather than closing the outdoor pool in the winter, it's just left open, with dirt and leaves collecting inside. There were beer cans and cigarette butts left beside the small indoor pool. You get the idea...2. The problem with Stowehof hosting so many weddings is that it's likely your stay will coincide with one. We enjoyed the living room with the cozy fireplaces a great deal our first two nights, but the third it was taken over by a wedding. We weren't warned about this in advance or compensated in any way for the inconvenience. We were basically banished to our room and kept awake well into the night by bagpipes and rowdy party-goers, even though our room was as far away from the action as possible.One more strange thing about Stowehof is that even though it has forty-something rooms, it feels like a B&B. There's usually no staff to be found. They're at home next door, and I'm sure they would be available for emergencies, but if you, say, run out if matches to light a fire (as we did), well, you're out of luck.

Furthermore, it's actually about a 20-30 walk to Piazza del Popolo, so calling it "B&B Piazza del Popolo" is a little dishonest.The place was clean and the owners were perfectly nice, but you should still know that this is not what it's advertised to be.

The owner is delightful--kind and helpful but not overbearing, as I found some B&B owners in Italy to be. She serves a scrumptious breakfast of fruits, breads, meats, cheeses, etc. She speaks a bit of English but her teenage son speaks more; he was gracious enough to translate when necessary.Rooms are large and tastefully decorated and there's even a living room for the three bedrooms to share. The rooms are in the upstairs of the owner's farmhouse, accessible through a separate entrance so you have complete privacy if you want it.You're only a few minutes from the delightful small medieval towns of Bevagna and Montefalco, and it's easy to make a day trip to Assissi, Perugia, etc. The owner will recommend nearby restaurants for dinner. Listen to her. They're great!

I like they have lounge chairs at our little poach area. However the smell from the bathroom it's really bad. We got to air the room each time we came back.The service ...kinda hit and miss. They are sometimes friendly especially the reception area but the restaurant...it takes lots of effort to get their attention. They are not rude just most local not used to English so it may came out rude or angry. Food can be better. We had breakfast there and half of our big breakfast served cold. It's obvious they precook them and just served it when ordered. To eat there isn't cheap too.

I thought I was setting myself (and my husband) up for disaster but it turned out better than I expected! We did exactly what was recommended online. Go to the popular rides first, eat lunch early (at 12noon) and take note the show time so that we won't miss anything. We ended up riding all the popular rides more than once, some thrice! (No Express Pass required) We had lots of extra time taking pictures and even try some of the children rides (:D). However, I would like to add a few things. It is great to wear shorts with zippers so that you can keep some of your paper money with you when going for rides especially those don't allow you to bring anything with ya and asked you to lock it in the locker. The queue wasn't taking too long just we were lost track of the time and then we were stranded because we over the 40mins free period (we were there 42mins mark - serious!) and need to pay 2$ before can collect our stuff. Our wallets were inside the locker. Luckily I manage to borrow some from a kind couple that just walked in to put their stuff inside the locker. Or better still load your EzLink card with some money on it and just carry it around inside your zipper pocket :D No coins because the staffs will buzz you out from the queue. We brought our own raincoat, one that provides good protection but thin. Because what they sell inside the themepark really do nothing for you. We even get to enjoy the Water World Show right at the wet area without being (soaking) wet! Don't go for Cylon and Human first if you are there early in the morning right when the themepark open. Why? Because that early, they are not running at full capacity. So eventho the lines aren't long but it will take double the time to clear. That's what happened to us..so after the Human ride, we went to another one then came back for Cylon when it is running at full capacity. We had a great time!

I'm talking about water literally dropping kind of pressure I couldn't bath because I got to catch the bus to Singapore. The room wall was paper thin and what make it worse was the staffs itself talking and laughing so loud which really unforgivable. Free Toiletries means soap & shampoo - No toothbrush and paste. LCD TV there for show because the reception was too bad to be able to watch anything. Yes free pick up or drop off transfer but Man I spent 20 mins talking and get them to pick me up because they suggested I should take taxi at my own cost.

Rice cake really taste like it was expired because of the texture was too sticky...asked the waiter about it but he acted like he is mute (if he is I'm sorry for being insensitive but it might not be a good idea to put him on the front line) bacon and kimchi was slightly below acceptable level. FYI We paid ¥110; were charged for the sauce and no other side dish provided (as the normal practice of any Korean restaurant).

I guess the guide I engaged play a major role to make this trip worse hiking trip ever. I'm not a hiker nor very adventurous but I'm a photography enthusiast so I thought I could take some amazing pictures of the active volcano. It took me 3hrs to hike up because the guide wanted to save a few thousands Rp. where the minivan could cut short half the trip. I would have pay for it if I knew such option. Because it was raining past few days the hiking became alot harder. Especially coming down it was not 1hr it took me 3 long hours.

It's very poorly maintain from the exterior to the interior. Both superior n deluxe cottages were totally waste of time and money. Yes they have this jacuzzi bath which is nothing to shout about and compare to the normal room category it's exactly the same. The Private cottage comes with balcony / deck facing the "Laguna" really a joke I meant it looked like a man made tiny miny lake really not worth the extra to get the Laguna view.Another thing I would like to highlight is the rating of this resort equivalent to the actual amenities provided is doubtful (strictly based on my personal experiences and understanding on how hotel rating works). I never stayed on a 4* resorts that provide so little basic amenities. Even a standard 3* hotels provide toothpaste but this resort doesn't. They only extend dispenser shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. Other than that comes 2 shower caps n cotton bud. Food - You'll get better and cheaper ones just 5mins walk outside of the hotel. Internet Connection - you need to pay for it which I'm ok pay but the connection extremely unstable. I was just thinking if they want to charge for something they better deliver if not they are just waiting for complainsConsolation - size of the room (which is actually very common within this area) and only 5mins walk to the main streets.

People just want to stay away from the crowd. I love this place for the fact that it's secluded and located at the north sanur residential area. 2. Do not make a big fuss about food. I stayed there for 5nights and they only have 4 options on breakfast set and it's basic which a little difficult for me because I eat like a king in the morning. 3. Not first timer to Bali. Ketewel (which this resort located) is not exactly the most strategic place to move around because it's far from most places of interest except for UBUD which is only 30-45mins drive. However the resort provides free shuttles to Sanur town 3 timing a day and to Ubud once a day (including pick up). Best part is there's only if I'm not mistaken 16 rooms and they have more than enough vehicle to accommodate all guests at any timing. I only spend 1 full day exploring outside of Ketewel and I hired the a vehicle for full day usage (8-10hrs) only IDR500k - cheaper than anything I know and they have brand new Toyota innova or alphard for bigger group. Things You Must Know1. Because the resort is very secluded not all taxi driver know the way so either you get the taxi driver to call the resort and ask for the actual location before hand or you might want to book the airport pick up from the resort directly(it's cheaper actually)2. Pipe water not exactly suitable for drinking because they recycle n process the sea water. So stock you evian or coke from the Sanur City and keep it inside your mini fridge. 3. Western menu are overly priced at the resort and it's not fantastic. But they do have decent local Indonesian Dishes you can order and reasonably price. 4. Please be patience with the staffs there because their understanding on English not so great because I did had a few mishap with the staffs at the Resort but they are all polite and helpful.

The place is a little bit hard to find because you have to walk a bit before reaching the place. I like the shoplots along the way in, it looks classic. Entrance fee was a bit pricey. Nice 3D art inside. You can posed creatively and took photo but without your camera flash. This place also have a place for you to sit and have some drinks or meals. Overall, in my opinion it is a good place for a visit.

The price per adult is RM30 if i'm not mistaken. A bit hard to find this place if you are not came from Sandakan because this place is up on the hill. You definitely need to use GPS to reach this place. Parking space is limited. Overall, it is not bad but more to an average place to dine.

We visited the park on October 10, 2016.We booked our tickets online on the Sentosa site and received a discount + a free water bottle (with the head of the Indominus-Rex from Jurassic World). I would recommend the online reservation because you won't have to spend a ton buying water bottles within the park, and the refills are not as expensive as filling up once.We entered the park around at 10 am, and Beetlejuice was standing near the entrance. We went on the Jurassic Park River Rapids ride first, and then went on The Mummy. The later's queue was around 45 minutes the first time we rode it, but we didn't get bored. There is music and sound effects along the way, and plenty to look at.We had lunch at the Discovery Center in Jurassic Park - wet noodles with vegetables. Four of us shared three plates as the quantity is pretty big and it's a little expensive. So this is a good option for vegans. The ambiance in the place was of course great.I emailed the company before-hand about options and they also suggested the Oasis Space Cafe. Their Indian option with chana masala, rice and papadums is vegan. Being Indian, we didn't want to have Indian food even on vacation (: Via email, they also said they could customize a pizza without cheese or dairy products. So make sure to contact them in advance if you have any special dietary needs.After lunch, we made our way towards the junction where Jurassic Park, Water World and Far Far Away meet, and got to see the raptor show. Took a bunch of pictures and successfully answered that Bubbles was a velociraptor (yay dinosaur-loving me!) We rode The Mummy again around at 3 pm and the wait time was only 10 minutes (yay!) We also walked around and discovered other places like the Canopy Flyer. If you walk a little further inside, you will see nice picture areas with a T-Rex fossil head and broken dinosaur eggs that you can sit in.Unfortunately we couldn't meet any of the Sesame Street characters. When we got to the designated area, they were leaving to take a break, and when we came back they still hadn't returned.Before leaving, we rode Madagascar A Crate Adventure, King Julien's Beach Party-Go-Round, Spaghetti Space Chase, Accelerator, Lights, Camera, Action, and Shrek 4-D Adventure.Our favorites were definitely Jurassic Park Rapids, The Mummy and Canopy Flyer.The park is small and the day we went, the crowd wasn't too big. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Everyone who worked there was always smiling. Would definitely visit again, thanks for the memories and the experience Universal Studios!

We booked through Booking.com and stayed in the family room which is on the top floor. There are no windows, and we thought it would be suffocating but it wasn't.Staff was extremely helpful with whatever we needed. They gave us directions to the places we asked about, and were very patient and friendly. I don't think any of us have ever stayed at a nicer hotel.Toiletries are provided and there was a fridge and coffee maker in the room, as well as a hairdryer.The only problem is that the TV in our room had only 20 channels - fear not, because they have English movie channels.There are numerous restaurants and shops nearby, including a 7-eleven right next door. I am a vegan and my family is not, but we ate food on all the days at either Brownice (10 minutes walk) or The Loving Hut (2 minute walk).We miss this hotel, and would love to plan a trip back here again!

It is owned by a friendly elderly couple. It was fun because they had a tobaggan that they let us ride. It was warm and cosy inside our cabin and well heated in the winter. There are two levels - a living room and kitchen on the ground floor and a bedroom with six beds on the second. The owner drove us to the ski resort every morning and picked up in the evening for free. Once, he gave us free passes to the onsen. He also has discounted ski passes and onsen tickets, so you can save a good bit of money.

Our guides, Zac and Amin were good fun and well informed. They didnt just brief us, but also spent a good bit of time teaching technicalities and answering the many why and how questions that we had. We did the White water rafting and mountain school with Nomad. We enjoyed both, but especially the ropes course in the mountain school as it was unique to Nomad adventures. Again, the guides were patient, confident and at the same time not over protective (which is very important when you have young kids)

When we were nervous about the abseiling, he was very encouraging and helped us out a lot.

We really loved crawling through the river. The guides were professional and friendly. Our two children, 7 and 9, enjoyed the grand tour so much. If you are fit and want the adventure, do go for the grand tour. You can get the stalactites and stalagmites in many places, but in Gua Tempurung, you really get to experience caving

The host, Mahin was very professional and friendly. He obviously loves his durians and we had a chance to try many of them as we went during the season. There were five dogs to keep the kids entertained, a small plunge pool and a balcony overlooking the river where you could read to the gentle sound of the water. The rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable, the farm grounds vast and great for exploring. Mahin also helped us arrange waterfall abseiling when we decided to try it. We are very thankful to the host for all his help to us to make our trip to Gopeng a memorable one.

The bathrooms were located just outside the huts, keeping most of the sand out of the sleeping areas. Mosquito nets kept most of the insects at bay and the insect repellents kept the rest away. This is a space in the middle of nature, the nearest village - a good 15 minute walk away - is just a fishing village. These things are not good for people who want a nightlife and loud activities, but they were perfect for us, as it offered an opportunity for total rejuvenation that we had not experienced before. We didnt have the opportunity to meet the owner Marc, who was away, but the staff were courteous and professional. The kids had a great time with Jeff, the owner of the adventure centre who took us out on a hiking trip. He has a cat and a dog and four kittens and six puppies, so obviously the kids were charmed. The beach is clean, great for swimming, Conditions in December werent suitable for snorkelling, but I foresee that this would not be a problem in the summer months. When we returned from the day's activities, there is the cold shower and simple food - made to order by the staff. On one of the days, we decided to sleep on the beach (too windy, but great experience under the full moon). All in all, we would love to return to mutiara. We have been to Bintan several times before and stayed at a number of resorts but the experience in Mutiara was very fresh.Cost is reasonable for the rooms, food is priced similar to Singapore. I think the cost for activities is similar to that of the resorts. Another plus is that there are no motorized activities, just things like kayaking - keeps the beach clean of the gasoline from motor boats which is so common in some of the other resorts

My qualms, however, was with the guide Francis. We had read another review where the reviewer had a problemw ith Francis, but thought that since most of the other reviews in trip advisor were ok, it was probably some kind of a blip. I think that Eco Cameron needs to train their guides to be a little more friendly, as they are the face of the company. Francis didnt greet us at all before we boarded the van. It was not until we were at the start of the walk that he briefed us, very shortly. no smiles, nothing. There were also two other guides who followed our party, but they, like Francis, gave the silent treatment. Over the four hour hike, the guide must have spoken a total of ten sentences to us. Its a bit creepy, to be honest.

Walking distance to town, but still far enough to be quiet2. no TV in the room (many people have said that this was not good, but we thought it was a great idea not to have tv so that families could do what they came to do and bond over the simple moments instead of stoning in front of the screen)3. Small, but sweet garden, which my girls spent a long time in, bee watching. 4. No coffee and tea making facilities in the room. This encourages guests to come to the little pantry area, which encourages interaction. 5. helpful reception staff6. Able to use the pantry space to cook simple meals. This is a real blessing when you travel with kids and dont want to get out to the nearest restaurant7. Excellent beds. Now for the things to improve. Please note that we were very happy with Arundina and these are just improvements and not something that seriously impacted the quality of our stay1. Housekeeping. There is no everyday housekeeping. While this is an incentive to pick your own stuff, its something we have gotten used to in hotels and B&Bs.2. No laundry service, although the lady at the reception sent our laundry together with the hotel laundry3. Breakfast is a bit too simple. While we are ok with toast and jam, we were a bit spoilt as there was homemade jam on the first day of our stay, which was replaced with shop brought jelly on the next few days.

The company is just location and nothing but. The guide was impolite and left us stranded in the middle of the river in the dark. We had very young children with us too. His excuse at the end - delivered very impolitely -was "If you dont follow instructions you are on your own". The only thing we did was lag a little behind when leaving the beach which is the case when you have kids. And he just left us at Noosa beach without a word to us that he was leaving. It got dark pretty soon after. Luckily we knew enough about paddling to manage across. Seriously, that place has motor boats and everything. If you get payment for a guided tour, which is twice as expensive as an independent tour, you give a guided tour and dont walk away without a word to the people you are guiding. Of all the travelling I have done with my kids - and I have done a fair bit, this was the worst service of all that I have experienced.if you are a good kayaker, you may want to still hire from them or something, but please be aware that you are not renting from a considerate person. Do you want to see dolphins or give your money to a man who leaves his charges behind in the dark with no warning or instructions?

The resort organized everything - from transport to resort to food to hiking etc, and all at a very reasonable price. the food selection was great with good vegetarian options. The staff offered to make veggie rice and noodles if I requested. The staff are friendly and flexible. Children enjoy the pool, peacocks, deers, goats, flying fox and the humongous shells in the beach. its definitely a place that I will take the children to again. The chalets were nice, ours had a bedroom and a living room and it was wonderful in the evenings to sit in the balcony. There were a few mosquitoes, but that is to be expected in a place like this, and they dont really bother you much. One problem I had was with the soap and shampoo. Given that we kept going in and out of the sea, a few more bottles of soap and shampoo in the rooms would be desirable.

It is not well sign posted and we had no idea how far it was from the transport. There is a lot on this Island and Universal appears tucked away in a corner. Once there it is a great place, first of all we received the Seniors Discount (it doesn't matter which country you are from - if you are over 60 you can get in at the Seniors Rate - just let them know when buying your ticket). The park was fantastic and well designed, we enjoyed the rides and things to see in all the lands. This is a fantastic day out.

The Pint of Beer cost me $19 - I did not believe it. This must be the most expensive glass of beer available anywhere in the world. Tiger is the local beer, other beers cost over $20 a Pint. Overpriced for sure. I felt I could not reject it as it was on tap - but maybe I should have.

To see the lights from the Harbour was much different to the land experience. In lots of ways it was much more comfortable as we avoided the crowds. The meal was ok and crew were great. I did have a trip on a step - it was pretty dark on board and I miss calculated - landed on my back, a crew member was available to assist. Saw the Physio the next day and the muscle I strained seems to be recovering.

The team were fantastic and really looked after us. This was our first time in a Hot Air Balloon and the 20km flight was an experience we will never forget. So quite, so peaceful, so beautiful. The pilot was excellent and made the experience that much more enjoyable. It seems to my wife and I that this is the only way to fly. We could hear the cows moo and the dogs bark below and were amazed by the scenic wonders of the Camden Valley. The flight was smooth and the lading perfect. A great experience.

We booked and away we went. What a great ride, the track is well hidden from the rest of the resort and we did not believe what a great track it was. Turns, tight spots, hills, even some short tracks along the beach. The team looking after us were great and ensured we did not get into trouble. Much more fun than we thought it could ever be. Great views and a great time. Go for a walk above the resort before doing the Quad's so you get an idea of what it is like up the hill - the houses and the small suburb etc. Great adventure.

Food prices were high but apart from that a great week. Lots to do and just loved the staff and all the resort had to offer. Watching the Dolphins being fed was fun - as we were in a time share apartment we could not feed them which was a little strange. The rangers working on the site are great and have lots of useful information about the environment. Enjoyed the four wheel drive safari and the boat trip out to see the marine life. It is just a beautiful place. Hint! If you like a bottle of wine in your room with dinner buy it at the convenience store not the bar and save around $10 for the same bottle of wine, Range very, very limited.

Planning to go again!”|review_467091781|I visited Universal Studio along with my family and my friend's family. We both have young kids (5 year old and 1 year old). But, that did not limit us from having all the fun! There are loads of things to do at Universal Studios for everyone. My Son (5 year old) had lots of fun at the Puss in Boots, Far Far Away from Shrek series, Madagascar themed ride, Transformers, etc. We had a great time riding on Battle Star Galactica! It's a great experience. Don't miss that. If you can go there on a weekday around 11, you can pretty much cover everything without buying an add-on express ticket. But if you are not so lucky, then better to buy an express ticket! This allows you to skip the queue for lost of the rides! Don't miss the Ancient Egypt and the Lost World attractions. If you are not too fussy about drinking water, try to carry an empty bottle so you can fill it up at various water stations inside! Food is expensive inside the studio, but you can always have god at the Malaysian Food court just outside Universal Studio. If you are lucky and it doesn't rain, you will have lots of fun! We plan to go there again during my son's school holidays!
Lokesh G|2F896DC6870D9822BA76049F41572428|Attractions|Ubud: Sri Ratih Spa|4| “Good boutique resort! Small tweaks will make it comparable to any large branded hotels”|review_435280157|We had been to Bali on a family holiday with my wife and son. My brother had booked Sri Ratih for his honeymoon so I booked Sri Ratih based on his suggestion. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at Sri Ratih. It lives up to the reviews on TripAdvisor. The landscaping is fantastic, the rooms are nice and the staff are pleasant to speak to and well mannered. I would certainly recommend this hotel for anyone who plans to stay at Ubud. There were only two issues which I though would, if tweaked, make Sri Ratih Cottages even better - (1) Breakfast options and (2) A/c. The free breakfast is basically 4 options to choose from and not the traditional buffet breakfast. That was a surprise to me and my family when we turned up for breakfast on day 1! It would be good if they make the breakfast a buffet rather than having to choose from very limited options. Especially if someone is planning go there on a long stay, the current breakfast options will surely make it unappetizing. Secondly, the a/c in our room was right near the room door in a corner and it took at least 2 hours for the entire room to cool down after the A/c was switched on. This usually meant late night sleeps. Please rectify the A/c problem. If this problem is only in one room, then you may just need to fix it. Except for these two, it was a fantastic stay and we will surely go back there if we visit Bali again.

The place is easily accessible so a lot of families go there for picnic.What makes Kawasan falls awesome for me is the canyoneering adventure - trek, hike, jump and swim to get there. We booked a tour with Kawasan Canyoneering for P1500 inclusive of a tour guide, motorcycle ride to get to the starting point of the trek (they didn't tell you that you'll ride a motorcycle on rough roads and cliff-side. Scary but the scenery is worth it), life vest, head gear and lunch. Canyoneering to get to Kawasan Falls is fun and there are some cliff jumps you can try which is a pretty unique experience.

We got confused at first that we ended up completing abour 2-3km of Trail 14 until we got to another marker that we realized we were following the wrong path. We went back to the spot and started looking for the 14-1 trail. We spent the first half of the day doing Trail 14.When we headed to Trail 14-1 which was the intial plan, it was past noon already so the sun was up and it was hot (we did the trail on a summer day). It was a cool experience because the trail will bring you to the peak where you get a great 360 degree view of Jeju! It will take you inside a forest. You might even meet some horses along the way. By the time you'll get to the midpoint, which is the Osulloc Museum, you will realize how much you miss civilization and strangers. The trail will connect you to nature. You'll even find yourself in a dense forest! There are a lot of blue/orange ribbons so you won't be lost. This trail taught me to simply trust and find the blue/orange ribbons and enjoy/embrace nature wherever the trail (or life in general) may take you. Haha. This is definitely off the beaten path but it makes your Jeju tour even more special and truly your own. I would want to do more of the Olleh Trails in the future :)

There are lots of picture opportunities for couples. You can even write love letters and hang it in the huge heart set-up they have there. There's also a mall where you can eat, drink coffee and use the toilet.

The Emerald Buddha is not that big and so you must go inside to see it. You won't need to stay too long inside if you won't worship or pray. Some feet smell too LOL!

There are a series of smaller Buddha statues where you can drop some coins in and make a wish. There are a lot of other temples which are very beautiful as well!

It was fun to climb. Among the temples in the area, this is my favorite because it sends a bit of adrenaline rush to climb those steps and reach the top! :D

The temple looks like any other temple but the fact that's it's on a cliff made it special.Watch the famous Kecak Dance (every 6:30 pm). Wear loose comfortable clothes as the place gets hot and full. Enjoy the beautiful sunset, the talent and hardwork of the performers, as well as the big gathering of people from different backgrounds, countries, etc. Stay until the end of the show to show respect to the performers. Read the handout to fully understand the story. Enjoy the magical moment! :)
Rachel B|8AC94C0942543F40160600A60594A839|Attractions|Ubud: Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary|5| “Fun, unique and exciting!”|review_420697069|It's fun and exciting to see monkeys roam freely in a sanctuary. This is way better than zoos because they are not caged and they have a huge place to roam around. Be careful not to touch them especially from the back or when they're unaware. My fiance did it out of curiosity (even if there are reminders on not to do it). The monkey turned back to see who touched him with an angry and ready-to-attack face. We quickly ran away but the monkey was still able to grab his backpack. Good thing there were a lot of staff and he was able to stop the monkey before it attacks us. So, the moral is follow the rules. LOL!In our most recent visit, we were already outside the forest buying local souvenirs. We were a few feet away from our car when one of the monkey grabbed the black plastic bag (where our newly- bought souvenirs are) and took one of the items there. He climbed a tree and we couldn't nor the staff get it back from him. Maybe he thought there's food inside. So if you're carrying any plastic bag even if you're outside the forest, still guard your belongings.Despite the angry monkey and the lost souvenir, we still got home safe and unscathed. I'd still recommend this place because it's unique and more ethical than most zoos. The place is huge so there are mini temple and a river inside.

There's a lot of walking and there are steep areas that at some point, my parents would just wait for us instead of walk all the way up the kinda steep walkway. It was a nice walk along the houses. It can also be considered a fun mini hike if you're up for that kind of stuff. The view of the sunset and mountain is beautiful from here.

There were a lot of really in love Korean couples and they're just cute to watch in their matchy outfits and sweetness to each other. This is a great place to feel their culture. There are a lot of shops and restaurants and food stalls. It's also a good place to buy souvenirs. There are nearby hotels/rentals in the area also.
Rachel B|8AC94C0942543F40160600A60594A839|Attractions|Seoul: N Seoul Tower|4| “Very touristy”|review_420692609|This is one of the most touristy places we've been to in Seoul. It provides a good view of the city. The love locks and the benches (designed the way they are to "force" shy couples to sit together) are also cute!The price to get to the viewing deck is 10,000won per person and 21,000 for two with popcorn and drinks. The place is ease to reach by bus or by cable car. We also saw some people hike so I think that's also an option and a fun way to get to the top. :)

This is where no-filter IG-worthy pictures are made of. You can join the tours and watch the changing of guards. The entry fee is cheap like around 2,000 won only and there's a lot to see here.
Rachel B|8AC94C0942543F40160600A60594A839|Hotel|Seoul: Seoul City Hotel|5| “Convenient location”|review_420690620|The location is good. It's close to a subway and walking distance to Seoul Station also. The staff is helpful and would even suggest when it's more economical to travel by taxi or by train especially when you're in groups. The place is clean and basic needs (toilet, toiletries, coffee) are provided. They even have a weighing scale near the elevator which is helpful for foreign travellers. :)

It's also walking distance from Gyeongbukgong Palace and the Bukchon Hanok Village. The hotel seems old but it's clean and provide complete toiletries and other needs. The staff was also kind and accommodating and good in speaking English. One time we were off the door of the hotel when it started raining, the staff even called us back and offered us umbrella even if we were already outside the door and we didn't even bother to ask him.
Rachel B|8AC94C0942543F40160600A60594A839|Hotel|Guimaras Island: Villa Igang Beach Resort|2| “Needs improvement in service”|review_358609701|We were here last Holy Thursday (March 22) for a pre-nup shoot. We paid P2800 for the room and use of the resort. We arrived and were handed a poorly constructed and hardly readable/understandable map that we didn't bother to look at. I'm not sure if they were undermanned at that day but we weren't given any guidelines or suggestions on the views and facilities that will turn out good in pictures. It was hard enough to get the manager's attention in settling the bill as there were a lot of people queuing for their rooms and other concerns. My fiance and I came from Manila and we were disappointed by how much smaller and less attractive the place was in reality than what we expected. The room was honestly not anything close to P2800 in value as we were only there for a few hours that day. The cabinet in the room was old and dirty, as well as the other furniture. There were ongoing construction and the place doesn't look very natural anymore. I think our experience and the output of our engagement shoot could have been so much better if they suggested good locations and provided a better map. The place didn't seem to stand out from other nearby locations.

This is actually the only meal I enjoyed while in Bali. The crispy duck was truly crispy but not soaked in oil nor was it burnt from grilling. Our driver brought us here as this is near our hotel in Ubud. The place is expensive because a lot of popular people/celebrities have eaten here before. I personally think it is expensive than all the other food we ate in Bali but it was the best food I had there. For me, it was worth it!
Rachel B|8AC94C0942543F40160600A60594A839|Hotel|Kuta: Harper Kuta|4| “Clean and modern”|review_332798491|I love how clean and modern the feel of the place is. We kind of expected the loud noise at night but surprisingly,there wasn't any loud party music and we were able to even have a good relaxing sleep in our last night in Bali.The staff were nice and kind. They even called a cab to bring us to the airport. Another great treat was that there was a breakfast buffet included even if it was not stated in our booking. The only problem we had was that their swimming pools closed at 8pm, which is really early. We were unable to enjoy their pool at all as we had an early flight the following morning.

Plus you can bring home a 6R sized photo for free! Such a good deal! We were not able to try all the rides due to limited time we reached the park before lunch and went out exactly at the park's closing time. It was a tiring but fun day! I'll definitely come back here to try the other rides that I was not able to try. The best ride I tried was Transformers and Battlestar Galactica-Human. Worth all the wait! And oh if you don't want to wait too long for Battlestar galactica ride one tip i can give is try riding it before the park close no lines and whatsoever! Haha!I'm just sad that I was not able to take photos with the characters especially Minions because they only come out for a couple of mins and they won't allow you to line up if its past the given time. Boo!!! Longer time pls. And oh fireworks! Make it everyday instead of just weekends and holidays pls! Went shopping at the USS store for souvenirs I got lucky somehow cause there are shirts that were on sale on the day we came so I was able to get shirts for the whole family! Yay! But its quite expensive there guys. So better have extra cash!
Chix C|B6477C1CF59FFA8619D62E844DE1830E|Hotel|Singapore: V Hotel Lavender|5| “Perfect Place!”|review_465749561|We booked the hotel through Agoda for 4D3N (March 1-4,2017). No problems encountered while checking in. There were lots of tourist when we came but they were able to assist us immediately we requested for a room with a view we booked Superior room but we were given a complimentary upgrade to a Premier room!Room number was 1315. It has a great view of the city. They always clean the room after going out even when they don't have the sign clean the room outside the door, they always provide complimentary water (plus points since water in SG is quite expensive). You should bring adapter since they don't have one in the room but we were not able to try to request. You can request for laundry bag for free. Our room was spacious for the two of us. It has a couch and you can sit beside the window overlooking the city or you can place your luggage there too. Bathroom was clean and amenities were complete and it has a hot and cold shower. Hotel also has wifi in every room.Location of the hotel is perfect! Near the city and its just below the Lavender MRT station, there is a bus stop at the side of the hotel and at the ground level of the hotel there are a lot of food court.We didn't book the room with breakfast so we have not tried any of the hotel food.The hotel has a pool located at the 4th floor but we didn't try since we were too busy strolling the city. If you want nightlife btw, Haji Lane is 10 mins walk to the hotel! Shopping wise 20 mins walk to Bugis street. Very good location!The hotel also sells discounted tickets to some tourist attractions in SG just like Universal studios. You just have to call the reception to inquire.I will recommend this place to my friends and will consider this hotel again when we go back to SG.

Our room was spacious and clean, clean comfort room, no airconditioner, 3 fans, it was soooo hot! Seriously no cool breeze of air. We were sweating! Good thing my friend brought her tent with her so we pitched the tent outside our room bring the 1 fan outside and as well as the foams so we did glamping style. Ladies slept at the tent and men at the room. Seriously it was so hot even if its night time.At the beach area, lowtide is from 9am-2pm it was a dry beach. Kindda disappointing but we did island hopping so that we can still swim around those time. Paid 250.00 each for island hopping. False advertisement were around the resort there is banana boat, jetski and flying fish but its no where to be found. But you can rent a ball to play beach volleyball for 100/hr.There is a fire dance at night we were napping around 6-7pm when someone tried to wake us up just to say that there is a fire dance and its about to start.. That's so rude!No electricity at the resort around 6am-11am and 2pm-6pm. There are times that there is no water at the cr but it will come back eventually. There is a fee for everything in the resort and its expensive! We paid for our room still you have to pay entrance fee, shuttle fee, we borrowed a cooking materials and there's fee as well.Nope, not coming back here again.

Made sure to drop by the place and include this to our itinerary. I thought the place was small but i was wrong since it has 2 floors, plus there were different room set ups/themes, i didn't know some of the stars because i think those are their local celebrities. But what i like the most is the wax figure of Michael Jackson's you wouldn't think it was a wax figure!!! I also like the cartoons, hello kitty, astroboy, doraemon, etc... O find it really cute! The place could get crowded and you have to fall inline to take pictures with some wax figures. They can also take your pictures inside using their professional camera however photo prints are pricey.Bought discounted tickets at our guesthouse. Combo with the peak tram.

We bought discounted tickets at the guesthouse where we stayed, we bought the Roundtrip Crystal Cabin.While were riding the 20 mins cabin ride i was so amazed with the view! It was so beautiful! I love it so much!!!When we got in the Ngong ping village we were lucky because there were still limited people around the area, plus HELLO KITTY stands was there. (HELLO KITTY IS MY FAVORITE) so i had so much photo op! The place was cool not good for bad weather. The village has free WIFI! So additional plus points for tourist.There were restaurants, cafes, souvenir shops inside the village. We were not able to get the photo they took because it was too pricey. :(After the Ngong ping village we went up the Big buddha since its very near the village you just need to walk through out the village.When its time to go back, there was a line already since there were a lot of people around after lunch time and when we got down the cabin we saw the line and wow! Line was soooo long so pls go here early!!! Went shopping at citygate outlets after.

We were not able to go to ocean park but they also sell discounted tickets to OP and Disney (we already bought our discounted tickets for disney in Manila).

They serve the usual breakfast buffet has to offer, Bacon, Ham, Sausage, Pastries, Salad, Egg station... Don't expect too much. Cons: Bacon ran out fast and they don't have it immediately available you need to wait for at least 5 minutes or so for another batch. The chef at the egg station is frowning i don't like him.

One thing I love about the place is how huge the place is! They have 3 swimming pool inside the property. My favorite ofcourse is the infinity pool! The pool is open till night i cannot remember the exact time but what i remember taking a dip at around 8PM! LOL! Night swimming with a beautiful surrounding.I forgot the exact room that we booked but it was name San Nicolas if im not mistaken, a room with a loft. We cooked inside the room! There are available utensils that you can use for free you just need to have your ingredients ready with you.The only issue that i had is its hard to reserve over the phone its either the line is always busy or not one's answering the phone.But overall we had a great experience!

Got in the hotel earlier than the usual check in time but they allowed us to check inside our room already. They even gave us a free upgrade from a deluxe room to a Suite room with a city view! Kudos to that!We stayed in room 1417. I love how spacious the room is! 2 Queen sized beds, Sofa, 2 LCD TV's, a study table, iPod dock.. Regarding the wifi i was not able to utilize their wifi since its not working on my iPhone (tried to connect so many times but failed - wrong password but noooo!) we called the reception and someone came up to try to fix it but unfortunately did not work. :( but the wifi worked on my bf's phone which is a Samsung Note 4. Weird. I also like the free shuttle service around BGC though there is a schedule... at least its free you don't need to bring your car with you to pay for parking fees at the mall. Some staffs are friendly but some does not even smile back at you... Regarding the breakfast.. It was okay nothing much special.. They should always have bacon ready since it rans out fast... Very fast!Pool... Cold. I was not able to swim so much because its freezing cold! hope they could have a heater on there pool in the future.I love chilling out at the 3rd floor there are sofa beds there!Love the hotel's location to since its at the center of BGC 5-10 minutes walk from Highstreet!!!Checking out, there was a long line when we checked out. They were only two receptionist, the end of the line is almost at the elevator so pls add more receptionist to speed up check out time. Will consider going back to this hotel in the future with my family. Upgrade again? Thanks F1! More power!

BTW! View was magnificent! :)

I felt that the long walk that we had from station 3 to station 1 is not worth it for the shake (good thing willys rock is just nearby so all effort was worth it) But overall it was good its just that i thought there were something so special about the shake that most blogs that i read recommended this place.I just hope that atleast they would have a stall in Station 2 so that we dont need to walk all through out the white beach just to go to there area.

Decided to eat here after the lady allowed us to view what was on there menu that night.They had a lot of selection for a very reasonable price not like to ote buffet in the area which prices were too expensive and there were few choices. They also offer free drinks here btw!My bf and i loved their seafood (talaba, shrimp and baked mussels) yum! There were pasta, inihaw, filipino food, kebab, etc... Did not regret my decision to dine here!

We stayed in a deluxe room with 2 queen sized bed! The room is good for 4 actually (we tried to request for a room with just 1 bed but they advised us that they only have 1 room with 1 bed which was taken already during our stay). The room is big enough for the two of us. There is nothing special about the room i think its just a plain hotel room What i honestly like about this hotel is the service they provide to their guest from the time the shuttle service picks you up from Dmall, you check in, the welcome drinks ad to the time you check out. Such hospitable people! Kudos to everyone. Another thing that I like is the Infinity pool! Its just so gorgeous and picture perfect especially at night! The location is far from the white beach but they provide free shuttle every hour from and to DMALL.They had free buffet breakfast too. it was good and they had a lot of selections!Overall experience it was good but they have some areas to improve too.

The room was huge. Big bed, Aircon was great. Clean bathroom, They also provide clean towels which you cannot bring outside the beach, they have a small TV inside the room (i really think that they should upgrade that), no wifi in the room btw and there is a charge for the wifi at the lobby (good thing i have data plan)Don't expect anything special on their breakfast buffet just plain ham, eggs, hotdog, pancakes, nothing special really.What i really like about this resort is that its beachfront! Its rare to see a cheap accommodation near the beach! Its in station 3 right beside Sands Hotel. You can still relax at night because its far away from the busy party area in Station 2! You need to walk not less than 20 mins for you to reach DMALL but its a good exercise.Another thing that i like at this place is the staffs. Everyone was so friendly and hospitable especially the group of ladies at the reception. Thank you for the warm service! I recommend this place to everyone.

Our room has 3 double beds on it. 2 Bathrooms, we felt like the room was not occupied for some time now since the bathroom was a little bit dirty. The resort is far away from the Sabang area so it was really quiet when we stayed here. We had to ride the hotel's free tricycle ride in order to go to Sabang for our lunch, breakfast, etc.. surfing too! The staffs are good and very attentive too if you needed something. The waves in the beach area since the resort is beach front is way much better than the one in Sabang area but this is not for beginners like me!

Stayed here last Feb 2013 as a Surprise Valentines Day celebration with my bf together with my lil sister since she loves to swim! The hotel's lobby which is located on the 7th floor was huge and modern! Check in took time (got there around 2 PM i was able to check in almost 3PM) because it was a weekend and there were a lot of people! Stayed in a Deluxe room room (twin bed) since King size are not available when we checked in. Room was quite small but i'm okay with it because I must say the hotel's bed and pillows are the best! Its super soft and comfy! The bathroom is clean and complete with the hotel complimentary necessity. I designed the room with all the pictures, balloons, cakes, etc.. and it was an easy task since the room was not that huge to decorate. Good thing! The hotel swimming pool located at the Deck Bar (7th flr) was a no no for me because it was too cold! I was able to swim for less than 30 mins because I was freezing! Literally! So my bf and I decided to chill in the deck bar ordered some cocktail and a snack while watching my lil sister enjoy the pool! hopefully the hotel might want to consider installing a heater in the future haha! Best part of our stay was the BUFFET BREAKFAST at Cafe 8 the breakfast was soooo good! The variety of foods they offer are the best its like having brunch! The hotel also offers free shuttle service if you would like to go to nearby areas such as malls, etc.. as for me I rode the free shuttle going to work the day I checked in since I left something at work! Plus points that I dont need to drive and park my car! Good thing I work near the hotel! Overall, our stay was good. I would recommend this hotel to my friend who would like to have a staycation!

My dad loves everything this hotel has to offer.. Recently my boyfriend,little sister and I drove to Tagaytay and decided to check in a hotel the first thing on my mind of course is TAAL VISTA! Its my bf's first time to check in this hotel and while we were parking his car I kept on telling him all the good stories I have in this hotel.. he was so excited to experience it for his self! When we got in the hotel as usual staffs are always accommodating they immediately took our bags while we check in. They were almost full house when we got there then the front desk offered us a room first was a room with 2 beds but since we were 3 i was sad because she told me that was the only room left available but then she advised me to wait for a while.. after a few minutes of waiting.. she gave us a good news and offered us a room with 1 king sized bed and a single bed. We immediately booked it without a doubt plus the room was discounted! Yays! The bellboy offered us to bring our things in our room and we rode a golf caddy on our way to our room! The room was spacious, it has a H/C shower and bath tub which my sister loves the most! The room has a view of the taal lake and at the left side view of Sky Ranch Tagaytay! We were not able to swim when we went here because it was freezing cold, December feels! But instead we roamed around the hotel the morning we woke up before our breakfast, my bf loved every part of the hotel! I was so happy that he was not disappointed! Food as always is awesome! Lots of variety to choose from.Again.. i won't have any second doubts of staying at this hotel because never have i felt any disappointments every time i stay here!

Next day, I called Marco Polo again to ask some help for a surprise for my bf then I explained what I wanted and the guy I spoke with told me that they will work it out. Few hours after that phone call a lady called me to follow up BTW her name was Sheena Galvez, we exchanged emails after that. Not to mention that this was a day before our stay.When we got in the hotel.. the only problem that we had is that only one elevator is operating from the 5th flr parking that goes directly to the lobby so we really waited a long time before we were able to go up (not so much of a biggy for us but hopefully next time operate all elevators since its a waste of time to wait for 10 mins for an elevator ride)Check In went smoothly didn't take so much of our time.. we went directly to the 44th floor (The Continental Club) where Sheena is and she was all smile when she saw us and offered us a drink. Waited for a short time before we go to our room since Sheena told me that the room was not ready for the "surprise" then when she got back she told us that we can go to our room which is 3114 when I got in I was surprise since the room is spacious! The bed was big and comfy, pillows were so soft, Huge bathroom which I totally love, extra pillow inside the cabinet, extra glasswares, the phone which is a charger a speaker and an alarm clock in one, Digital do not disturb and clean up room sign and the NESPRESSO MACHINE! But the most important part was the surprise.. there's a Complimentary wine, our picture in a frame, and the letter for my bf which I emailed to Ms Sheena day before waiting for us. I was so happy because my bf didn't expect that there will be a surprise for him waiting inside our room. 15 mins after a bellboy came and it was a complimentary cake too (SWEET!) --- not to mention that they did not charge me for anything for the surprise that I requested! THANK YOU SO MUCH MARCO POLO FOR MAKING THIS POSSIBLE especially to SHEENA GALVEZ! Kudos to you! You deserve more than the small gift we gave you.After taking a short nap we went out for dinner the hotel is located nearby the malls in Ortigas area, one cab away if you don't want to bring a car (but hopefully in the future Marco Polo offers a free shuttle service that will cater to there customers not only in the airport but also in the nearby malls around the area). When we got back our room was tidy up again and there was another surprise waiting for us... a TEDDY BEAR! Super sweet! I have no idea that there would be another surprise. I was so overwhelmed. I must say I am a very happy customer. 2nd day, Buffet Breakfast was soooo good, you can choose from the wide variety of food Cucina offers.We were able to visit the infinity pool but we were not able to swim because the water was too cold! But he guy there told us that they are in the process of installing a heater which I think will be great! (the next time I visit hopefully its already installed) We were able to visit the other part of the hotel which is the function room, grand ballroom, VU's Bar everything is just great! Marco Polo definitely exceeded our expectation I'll make sure to go back here! :)

We just walked from out hotel to the location of Zubuchon in Escario St. it was a 10 mins walk.When we got there the staffs immediately greeted us good afternoon and with all smiles! We ordered the ever so famous Zubuchon lechon, Zubuchon Sisig, kangkong and another food which i forgot what it is. All i can say is same as Anthony Bourdain's review "BEST PIG EVER!" Haha! The lechon skin was Crunchy, the lechon was so juicy and yummy! Same as the lechon sisig it was also one of the best sisig ive ever tasted.It was raining so hard when we were eating in Zubuchon adn we decided to stay and rest for a while until the rain subside.And during the time we dined in a guy with a glasses approached us and asked us how was the food? And since it was raining so hard outside the guy offered us a dessert on the house! We were shy and shocked at first but still this guy insisted and asked if we want to have Cassava cake or Biko. We choose Cassava cake and we thanked this man who offered this to us. When the waitress placed the dessert in our table we asked her who that guy is since he already went out the restaurant and the waiter told us that he is the owner of Zubuchon!!! Not only that branch where we ate because we thought it was a franchise but he is the owner of all the Zubuchon in Cebu!Its a rare opportunity to meet the owner of a business and if we only knew we should have taken a picture together with him. The waiter told us that its his birthday that day and he is really kind. We saw him again riding his car we like to call him to thank him again and greet him happy birthday but he seems in a hurry and we got shy already so we just decided to ake a picture of the cassava cake! Hahaha! But the Cassava cake was so yummy it was not that sweet but it taste really good!But hey on behalf of my friends and I again, MR. JOEL BINAMIRA we would like to thank you for being so kind, being so humble that you didn't even introduce yourself being the owner of Zubuchon, for being so generous and for coming up with a business such as zubuchon. A one in a million experience that we will never forget aside from the yummy food you're restaurant offers. Lucky us!More power and God Bless to Zubuchon and to you Mr. Binamira!Were hoping to have a Zubuchon branches in Manila soon! Yes? Hihi.

Haha!So we did.. We ordered 2 set of pasta, pizza and Quesadillas for merienda. The food was great! But my fave was the quesadillas one of the best Ive ever tasted! Let me also give you a heads up that food here is cheap! So extra bonus points. Haha!Before we go back to Manila we ate again in Mooon Cafe but this time in The Terraces at Ayala Cebu this time we ordered a lot from Rice meals to Pasta to Pizza and the famous Quesadillas that our bill got to as high as 2,600+ for a group of 4girls and and a guy.

Bed and pillows are comfortable.. Each room has its own LCD cable tv but the 2nd room which is Room B, the TV was not working.. Bad side is socket was very limited were group of 5 people and we need to charge a lot of gadgets but they cant provide any extension cable even if its says on their book thing inside the room extension is avail upon request. We called the front desk and the lady told us that they don't have extension wires.Food - complimentary breakfast was so so.. Don't expect too much. Its good to eat something for breakfast than nothing.Customer Service - i really think that the management should invest with the training of the staffs from the hotel guard to the bellboy and almost everyone! When we got to the hotel via taxi we have a lot of baggage but no one helped us bring our bags down except for the taxi driver, the guard was just staring at us and didn't even greet us good morning. When we entered the hotel the receptionist greeted us with a smile so thats a plus. We waited for like 30mins before we were assisted to our room located on the 6th floor.. we stayed in the hotel to take a rest for an hour and found out that one of the TV was not working we immediately called front desk and they told us that someone will go up to fix it. Its been 20mins no one went up called again and no one went up till we decided to have late lunch outside the hotel and buy our ferry tickets bound for Bohol.. maybe we thought that when we come back the tv will be okay since before we left the hotel we advise the receptionist that no one went up to fix the tv. When we got back around 7pm our tv is still busted no one assisted us after several reminders. We called the front desk again and advise abt what happened then after 10mins someone came to our room to fix the tv the tv went on but the man advised us that there was a problem with the cable (tv on the other room was working perfectly fine) they will call skycable i think to report but until we left the hotel no one came back to us to fix that problem.. On our 2nd day we requested to have an extra bed inthe morning before we left for Carmen Cebu so that when we get back in the evening the bed will be ready already when we got back at 8pm our room was a mess even after we left the Clean up room hanging outside our door no one came to fix our room and the extra bed was not there. We need to call the receptionist 2x to req for that extra bed and around 3x to req for an extra pillow and water. So i really think investment to there people is a must.The hotel basically is good if you will just stay here maybe for overnight stays. Not recommended for customer service savvy people.

We ordered the pancakes and 2 x cooked breakfasts for our family. 1 cooked breakfast came out then 35mins later after everyone else at table had finished eating the other cooked breakfast came out which tasted disgusting- gooey sloppy scrabbled eggs that were cold and probably sitting in the kitchen waited to be bought out the whole 35mins of waiting.

Spoke to one of the caretakers who said "I do patrols during darkness and if your too noisy, you'll get a warning then out with no refund(edited version)." ... Sorry teenagers, still have to go to bed with fat cat! I got the chat as 2 blokes (not from my camp) sat outside my unit having a chat(no music) after I arrived....... And I went to bed at 8pm with my 2 toddlers but copped the blame for keeping the caravan park awake. Apart from that particularly rude munchkin, Other staff do patrols during day and night on an electric golf cart, staring into your site to catch you out. Beware. But if you do go, lovely beach which goes for km's each way. Spectacular scenery.I am not saying all staff in this blog are in the 'warden like' category, but with some others even a smile went a stray. (Btw there are nice staff there too who this doesn't apply to). I'd definitely like to go again one day, but not under the current caretakers.

azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Restaurant|Kuala Lumpur: China Treasures|3| “Some dishes were pretty good”|review_491768424|We booked a few tables for an iftar function a couple of days ago. It was aimed as a thank you makan to our high valued clients in celebration of ramadan & for informal bonding between us and our top customers. It wasn't a buffet kind of thing. More like an all you can eat ala carte dim sum affair. We could order additional, if we wanted to, on top of the initial serving we requested for. Maybe the idea is to discourage wastage which happens too much in this muslim holy month. What happened was that we ordered quite a bit initially that all of us were too stuffed to order anything else after that. This is a gd thing actually because the servings were plenty. From the dishes that we ordered, some were pretty good. The salted egg mushrooms were outstanding for me. I just can't get enough of it. The fried yam was also delicious cooked identical as the penang style char kuay teow. Apart fr that the steamed chee cheong fun dish with prawns inside tasted fresh and prevents staleness from a table filled with dim sums. Other than that, the dishes were pretty decent. If you're into halal dim sum, you could give the dim sum joint in pnb darby park a try. Other than that the ones in quality hotel and sogo is worth a mention. There are currently a slew of chinese muslim restaurants all over town offering dim sum meals at all hours of the day. All in all, i wouldn't mind coming here again. But being a food adventurer, i'd also be inclined the other many food restaurants all around the klang valley.
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Attractions|Paris: Champs-Elysees|4| “Paris' High Street with loads to see”|review_489393272|Visited CE on sunday 7th May. It was a windy spring evening in Paris. Still the go-to venue in Paris. A big road and the famous arch-de-triomphe at the end of it. Lovely walk in paris where u will see a gigantic historical monument at the end of it. Kinda like walking in a tunnel and seing a bright light at the end of it as a final destination. Still remember the day france won the world cup in 1998 and seeing all the french supporters celebrating at the arch of victory. This time around, it was election sunday and macron just won. Could see a bunch of his supporters celebrating with flags. And the rest i would say, is history. Wonder what the scenes would be like had le pen won that sunday. Anyway, champs is very important street in Paris. A lot of gd french branded shops to seek out. We spent the evening here after going to louvre, then notre dame and before ending the day to watch the glittering lights at eiffel at 9.30pm when night fallls. At CE we managed to visit a few shops such as the famous LV, Lacoste and the PSG club store. This LV store and the one in Gallerie Lafayette is famous among malaysians because malaysian women basically loves LV. It is a status symbol between the haves and have nots in kuala lumpur and this shop is not available in la vallee. Longchamps & Lacoste is famous too but does not carry the same status symbol .I once met 2 malaysian girls who are acquaintances of my wife when i came here in 2014. They were holidaying in london and only came to paris for a day via eurostar and guess where their destination was? Yes, you guessed it,.. LV Champs Elysee. What we really wanted at the end of it was to relax and do some people watching sipping coffee and eating french pastries at this legendarily famous street. In the end we settled at a pastry joint called brioch doree. Prices were reasonable and the pastries were excellent compared to what we usually get in malaysia in particular and in asia in general. The difference in paris CE this time compared to our last visit in dec 2014 is that they havr ferrari & lamborgini cars for rental. I saw quite a few takers enjoying the chance to ride these iconic cars. All in all, i topped all the walking we did on this street to take a couple of photos at the arch. Photos were impressive, as usual.

Plenty of tourists here be it night or day. In my point of view, Las Ramblas is one of the attractions in Barcelona which is unique and different to other parts of Europe. It feels really fresh and invigorating to be here. Barcelona, with it's unique buildings and architecture and warm weather, always stands out with other attractions in Europe. And Las Ramblas is one of the key components of this great city. LR itself is a long path which you can walk and enjoy everything. People watching, souvernier huntings, restaurants, food stalls, etc. You can find the la bouqeria mercat somewhere in the middle. There are other attractions on the side such as an erotic museum, etc. For muslim travellers like me, there is even a halal kebab restaurant on the street. There are many restaurants along the walkaway selling barcelona favourites such as paella, tapas, sangria & wine sellections. La rambla itself is very central and connects to the other attractions at the city centre and the main square. Also to the Roman Quarter. We enjoyed our time here and would love to come again next time we come to Barcelona.

We visited this building in May 2017. Outside, it's FOC while inside, you would need to pay cover charge to get inside the building. Both this building and casa battlo are nearby. So it would be wise to visit both Gaudi designs one after another and on the same day. There is also a souvenier shop on the right side if u want to buy goodies for memory or for close relatives.
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Attractions|Barcelona: Gothic Quarter (Barri Gotic)|4| “An important piece of Barcelona's history”|review_488184647|We went to visit this place on the same day that we visited la boqueria. Read somewhere that the 2 are close to each other in the centre of Barcelona. If you look closely enough after leaving la boqueria & las Ramblas, or ask the local guys at the stalls, that would be enough to lead you to the GothicQuarter. It is estimated between 5-10 minutes for you to walk to get to there. It is recognisable fr the roman cobblestone steps on the floor and medieval looking buildings/churches in the area. Brings to mind that this catalonian city was once a part of the roman empire. There are many souvenir stalls too everywhere in this area. We found the best souvenir bargains in this area. Do Check out the sports, t-shirts and fridge magnet souvenier deals on sale. A tip for you is, if you need to go madrid after barcelona, get any general spanish souvenirs in madrd instead of barca as it is generally cheaper over thr. At night, one of the squares outside the church at the quarter is quite lively. There are people selling stuff to tourists and plenty of picturesque opportunities nearby the old church. Plenty of restaurants too selling local favourites such as paella, tapas and Sanghria We saw museums here offering flamengo show packages as well but didn't get the opportunity to watch it. Well, maybe next time.

Barcelona has many gaudi inspired buildings and 'the house of bones' is one of it's finest. Very aesthetically pleasing and a sight to behold, it is a must go for architecture and historical students and travellers. I didn't go inside as i felt the euros needed was a little steep and feel that it is gd enough a view for the outside. Managed a few photo shots. Check it out.
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Attractions|Paris: Notre Dame Cathedral|4| “This historical cathedral is a must-go in the paris checklist”|review_487160937|Visited this cathedral in a cold spring evening in may. It looks awesome. It would probably look awesome too in winter or summer because that's what it is. It is a unique looking church. Not an aesthetic looking one like the la sangrada familia but it's appearances lasts in your head longer than the time you visit it. And picture taking in front of it gives a feeling of beauty and an imposing structure feel and a 'been there done that seen that' kind of ancient historical monument. I know there are many historical elements to this building. And it kinda brings you back to the medieval times with that look that it gives. I will leave history to the historians (and to the history channel ) and focus on it on my own. My 5 visits to paris did not bring me here and i was happy to do it this time. There are many tourists in the area. Always busy. And a few dodgy looking individuals. Be cautious of your wallets and valuables when you're here, friends. You'll never know. Eveyone looks so touristy and so friendly. Don't forget also to check out the souvenier shops and restaurants on the other side of that main road. As muslim travellers, we had our fix of halal kebab on the street behind the main shops opposite of this cathedral. If you're into arts, there are plenty of people selling pictures on the road leading to NDC from the metro. All in all this is a must visit place in paris and i would recommend it for all first time travellers to do so.

A landmark tower few in the world can compare or match to. A wonder to behold. I've been to paris many times and have visited eiffel in the past, but have yet to come at night. This time, we went elsewhere 1st and waited for the day to end and for the night to begin up until 9pm to visit this place at night for it's majestic look and light effects after dusk in this lovely spring evening. It was well worth it. The queue was short, hence we took the trip up to view the city from up above too. I was a bit scared of heights but my better half enjoyed it throughly. The normal lights started around 9-9.30 pm i think. But the pretty blinking lights began at 10pm and luckily, we were on the ground when it started to record photos and videos of this sight to behold.Their is a carnival funfair rides too nearby the eiffel tower and senegalese guys selling cheap souvenirs. Just be cautious of pick pockets, fraudsters and con artists and your trip here should be nothing less than amazing. Bon Nuit, Eiffel Tower.

So, we didn't have the patience to queue to visit inside the museum. Nevertheless we had a bit of a fun in a rainy spring day of may in this much visited museum. The photo shots were good and there were not many people when we went. So, it was a trip well worth going. Amazingly, i hv been to paris 4-5 times but this is my first time here. Guess i must hv spent too much time visiting french boutique shops in champs elysse or at galerie lafayette . Glad i came this time and wouldn't mind visiting here again.

During this time took the 5 days travelcard option. Price is reasonable. We travelled around in a stroller. And technically wasn't allowed to push the stroller thru the escalator. Some stations don't have lift. Some stations don't even have escalators. In the end i had to carry my toddler's stroller everytime i had a staircase to negotiate. To improve madrid and be world class, they will need to improve facilities for the elderly and families with young children. Also, directions weren't crystal clear. We sometimes had to go thru a metro train stop in order to get to another line instead of bypassing railway tracks in order to get to the correct line. You will find that the london tube & paris metro a better version in this sense and which madrid must emulate to be a world class city. All in all, it is an easy mode of transportation for tourists like me and we would be happy to come back and use the metro line again.

I had to watch a la liga game live as it is in my bucket list. I have watched a premier league game before and viewd mant matches in stadiums im my country, Malaysia.The atmosphere at the stadium was eletric on matchday. And the crowd was filled with beautiful mostly Spanish people and supporters of los blancos. To get to the stadium is very easy as the metro station is named after it. And once u'v reached the station via blue line, the stadium is right next to it. The stadium is huge. We went thru gate b. Noticed that the stadium is a bit dated and In need of some fixing. There were stalls selling souveniers and drinks outside the stadium. Inside the stadium they sold food as well. We had our dinner after the game at a small mall nearby the stadium. We were quite famished and at the stadium waited for the crowd to clear a bit. I love the once in a lifetime matchday experience but i don't think i'll come again. I'm a Manchester united fan actually. Congrats anyway to real madrid, they beat sevilla 4-1 to inch closer to the league title.

Less than 24 hours in paris before catching the next flight home. Just needed to sleep actually. Booking a hotel with free shuttle, a clean toilet and a cozy bed was the priority for my small family including our 4 yr old toddler. But what we got was above our expectations. The room was very clean. The bathroom incl. the shower area relatively spacious compared to the prev 3 accomodations we stayed in at europe. The tv has many channels. The check in super fast as was the check out. The breakfast buffet is quite generous and has variety altho' maybe not the liking of rice loving asians . There is a kids area to play with and a kid's pack upon request at the counter. Note the area next to the kiddies play zone has free flow coffee and pastries. Great!!!Even a small roissy village to stretch post breakfast other mealtimes and view the flowers of spring. Restaurants too if ur not into hotel food. Hate to nitpick. But to be a perfect hotel, maybe there are slight improvements needed. For e.g. It wouldn't hurt the frontline staff to smile once in a while. There are no kettles in the room to boil water for food or drinks. Other than that, i'd love to come back here if my stay is below 24 hours.Kudos to the hotel team for a minimalist accommodation service well run with machine like efficiency.

But this turned out to be a very commercial market. Prices are mainly for tourists. They have plenty of variety but at prices above average. When checking out this place at websites, there were people saying that there are euro 1 dollar tapas here. But, it wasn't so. Most of the stuff are 2-2.50 euros each. A far cry fr the eur1 impression that I initially got. If you're in barcelona, check out la bouqeria for a real market with market prices such as eur1 juices and eur9 freshly cooked and big portioned chicken paella. I would give this market a miss next time i come. Unfortunately it's just a trendy touristy market and not a real market.
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Attractions|Barcelona: Camp Nou|4| “Massive”|review_483616190|Visitied the world famous barcelona nou camp stadium for the stadium experience tour. Managed to view their trophies, get a feel of watching at the stadium and from the team bench, the away dressing room, the press & photo area, the matchday 'hot dog' stand and plenty of other things. They are a team rich in history and i admire their success. Although at the price of my own team, manchester united, in 2009 & 2011. They have a great philosophy too as embodied by their whole culture. Legendary players whom i've admired all my life such as stoichkov, romario, ronaldo & figo. Great tour. Got to view & buy souvenirs at the megastore and see the sale stands as well.
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Attractions|Barcelona: Park Guell|5| “Nature park with a touch of design”|review_483609192|We went there to try visit a park after a few days of touring the city. Lovely experience as we not only get fresh air, some exercise and great views of the city, but also visit some of gaudi's work. To get to the top takes a bit of a climb. But if you need a break from shopping and all those cathedral & museum sites, this is a breath of fresh air. Need to pay Eur 8 to enter, but once inside, there's plenty to see. Including a great view of the city up till the cruises parked on the sea shore. Not to forget all those gaudi designs and museum which someone told me was the home of gaudi himself. We took a lot of photos here and on the way down there are plenty of cheap souvenir shops for budget-y tourists like us .
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Attractions|Barcelona: Basilica of the Sagrada Familia|5| “Out of this world”|review_483595568|Went to this cathedral twice. The first time during the day & passed by again at night. We stayed nearby the girona metro, hence nearby at only 1km away. Out of the 2 experiences, i would say that it is better at night. Beautiful during the day & enchanting at night. When the sun sets, they the lights are switched on at certain areas, which brings a certain eerie feel to the otherwise disneylike appearances. Furthermore, it was nearly full moon when we passed by. Don't forget to check out the window glasses which are colourful and pretty. During the day, u get to visit inside. Don't forget to book online for access in order to avoid dissapointment. The aesthetic cathedral view from inside is worth the entrance fees. One can't help but marvel at this gaudi masterpiece. There are many technical details to the building which are best captured or explained by barcelona tourist & architectural websites and recerences. There are many souvenier shops nearby Sagrada Familia which makes this area a one stop tourist centre. There was a small playground too for kids to have a slide or two. This enables parents to catch a breath or two. Viewing one of Gaudi's greatest work while eating hot churros or cold chocolate churros is highly recommended. Try this little joint by the corner; xurreria sangrada familia to sample this local delight. They have other pastry goodies too but i think their forte is the hot churros with hot chocolate and/ or thick sweet chocolate dips. If Sagrada Familia represents and is a major symbol of barcelona, then it is easy to understand why this catalonian city is described by many in the past and present as the great enchantress. 
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Hotel|Kota Kinabalu: Gaya Centre Hotel|3| “Strategic Location”|review_478846411|Spent a night here. We actually targetted another hotel nearby but got priced out. From the website, this hotel wasn't highly rated but it had a nicely refurbished bed (and room). Furthermore the location was strategic as we had work to do at our office nearby. This hotel's location is quite central as it was just within 100 meters of huge suria sabah mall. It is also near to jesselton port, gaya street and a whole lot of stuff in KK city. Upon check in, we were quite disappointed. This hotel needs to refurbish a bit, especially the worn out carpet in the rooms. The bed was also different compared to the photos in agoda. After a long & tiring day, managed to sleep peacefully at the bed. I suppose the beds were cozy enough for me. So, no compains from me about the bed comfort levels. Wifi service was rather poor too as we had to reconnect many times. Breakfast, was rather limited but we were still happy that they provided compared to some boutique hotels in gaya street we stayed last year which did not offer this package. Food, whatever was available, was ample. Overall, i'm 50-50 about returning to this hotel again or recommending others to it. A lot needs to be done, especially to the carpets in the room and in the common areas. 
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|5| “Bucketloads of fun”|review_466380828|Came here to celebrate my son's 4th birthday. We had a great time. Despite him having a flu, he had plenty of fun in uss. My boy is a real animal cartoon fan, so the madagascar rides were his personal favourites. Luckily he's seen the shrek movie before we came here too. He loved the shrek dungeon cinema thingy too. Although the queue was long and the briefing took a while, it was all worth it. The water effects from the donkey sneeze & other scenes was a major talking point for him all the way back to the hotel. So we knew that the short movie screening was memorable and enjoyable for him. We, the parents could not go for the sci fi rollercoaster rides becoz it was just the 3 of us and my toddler was ineligible for then. One of us had to take care of the child, so it would be less enjoyable to experience it alone. The people we saw who took them seems to have had a really good time. Who knows, maybe we'll be back again when he's grown up to enjoy the rides we couldn't take this time around. Plenty of retail shops and eateries in here too. A great many options from the themed shops all the way to the main one at the entrance. Goods and merchandise cane with plenty of variety and it would be a challenge for anyone coming out of those shops empty handed what with the great many varieties you guys have on offer. Another thing to mention is the appearances by characters which are lively and well scheduled out thruout the day. We had bucketloads of fun with the penguins and other madagascar characters. Special mention to the big guy who hosted the madagascar dance thingy. He is lively & friendly. Thank you to the whole uss team, i feel that you guys set the benchmark for a well organised theme park within our region which other similar parks can try match or gauge their own standards.
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Hotel|Singapore: Marrison @ Desker|4| “Good Location”|review_466374171|Booked this hotel for a night. It was recommended by a friend who is familiar to the area. We wanted a reasonably budgeted room as we were here in S'pore for 2 days only for the sole purpose to bring our son to USS for his birthday.Our friend knows that we loved food, especially with some curry flavour and the north east line (purple) from farrer road at nearby city square mall level b1 is perfectly in the same line as harbourfront mrt which leads to universal studios at sentosa island. So no transit stops are needed. The room is sufficient enough and cozy. Lucky for us, room was ready at 11am although the official check in time is 2pm. We came earlier simply to deposit our luggage and was pleasantly suprised when our reception guy, mr simon informed that the room was ready. Thanks sir,.. We reallt appreciate the little and simple things and wifey mentioned that we would happily return to this hotel next time. As mentioned above, plenty of food joints in the area and i could see there was a variety of restaurants and not just curry eateries here in little india. City square mall has plenty of food options too! Kudos to the hotel. It was nice and clean with comfy beds.My tip to would be travellers coming here is to choose the rooms with a window as there are rooms without them. Claustrophobic people may not like the ones without proper air circulation.
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Hotel|Beserah: Swiss-Garden Beach Resort Kuantan|3| “Nice for a night or 2”|review_448813025|We made our new year plans quite late. So, a lot of gd places in kl, penang & melaka were already booked. So we decided to try swiss garden kuantan because the price appears reasonable, the photos appeared enticing and most importantly, there were still available rooms.We liked the idea of kuantan because it was just 2 hours plus from kl via the LPT highway. There are plenty of patin tempoyak stalls at the temerloh r & r. The temerloh catering stall is a must try!!We didn't take the new year dinner package and kinda regretted it. The buffet spread looked great with bbq crabs, squids, mantis prawns & lamb thrown in. It is cheaper to take the package offer during booking time rather than taking the option on the day itself where the price looks higher by 30 per pax.There are plenty of restaurants outside the hotel. They are cheaper options than the ones as the resort but one particular restaurant, yala thai restaurant overcharged us for a decent dinner. They knew we were from kl and probably took advantage of it. Try the sara thai restaurant around 1km from the hotel for better seafood dishes. The hotel itself has plenty of facilities. There are sufficient things to do for a day or two. Child friendly hotel with a very swimmable pool and nice playground too.The beach is breezy and they have parrot bar by the pool and malibu bar on the inside for the thirsty travellers. Rooms seems recently furnished altho some basic facilites looked a little tired and run down. It was ok tho becoz the price of rm270 per nite is still reasonable for the 'offerings' they have in store. Alas, we had to leave for kl after one night as our son was not well. We promise to return here within this year as we felt that we have not enjoyed the hotel and surrounding areas to the fullest. As per the review title suggests, i would recommend this hotel for a few nights stay and it is one of the better hotels in this side of the world.
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Hotel|Siem Reap: The Cyclo d’Angkor Boutique Hotel|4| “Warm & Friendly”|review_437618188|We arrived on 11/11 for a 4 day visit of Siem Reap. This is our 1st time here and took the early flight in. Reached SRIA as early as 7am. We went straight to the hotel as we need to store our luggage 1st and obtain a room, if possible. The hotel staff were very warm & friendly. Mr Ram greeted us & took our details. It was a very good 1st impression by him apart from the 1st look beauty & clean cyclo hotel.Mr Thea too was very warm & friendly, especially towards our son. He is very attentive and responsive towards our every need and situation. As we were early and the stansard check in time is 2pm, we were willing and offered to pay for a day room. Ram advsed us to wait as they tried to get us a room early. Unfortunately, since they were fully booked, we could only secure a room at noon, at best.. we arrived during their water festival celebrations and good hotel rooms are hard to come by at this time of the year. In the end, we got our rooms at 2pm as the departing tenants left late. But we appreciate the effort of the cyclo boutique team to secure us a room quickly. Fear not, we spent half the morning surveying the town and spent the other half at the pool which we enjoyed until our room was ready. This place is Aesthetically pleasing. I admire the owner, designers & maintenance team. Everything is in good taste here. The rooms, the cafe, the pool, the reception hall, etc..The hotel itself is not in the town area, but there are sufficient shops and facilities in the area. There are souvenir shops nearby, a few mini markets to the left, a couple of massage parlours and the duty free shopping (dfs) outlets at the end of this road.Hotel provides a spa too and a clean pool to swim or relax by the sides. Food and drinks prices aren't too far off compared to the outside rate and there are plenty of sofas and chairs to sit and laze about at the lobby. Although the cafe ladies team aren't as smiley and warm as the reception team, the breakfast portion and quality more than makes up for it. It's a beautiful cafe with well chosen decor and pretty pictures on the wall. The food servings were generous and even my 3 year old son was given a breakfast option. I was there for 3 days and i chose the fried noodles each time. As we are muslims and don't eat pork, I would recommend the beef over the chicken noodles as it is tastier and i think it is the specialty of the indo-chinese people. My wife chose the soupy noodles and i felt i made the better choice . Not to nit pick, but to achieve perfection, there are a few things the hotel may want to look at. We are fully aware that this is a boutique hotel but some designs aren't child friendly. Parents need to be careful as there are many sharp edges to avoid not only for young kids but to adults too. The bathroom, though sufficient, is pretty economical in terms of space. You'll need to exercise caution to prevent bumping into things while moving around the toilet. Another point is that it is not that near to town. You would need transport to reach town area. 2 USD may not sound like much but if you were to travel about daily, it would cost you a small fee otherwise better spent at massages or small souveniers available everywhere. Would i stay here again?, most definitely. Honestly, i'd be lying if i say i wouldn't like to stay in town area where i can drop in and out of massage parlours and shop every free time i had, but the warmth of the hosts and the quality of service is important and is a big point to ponder on. Besides, all the basic stuff are within 5 minutes of the vicinity anyway
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Attractions|Florence: Mercato Centrale|5| “Excellent 1 stop centre”|review_426355581|We absolutely loved shopping here. This place sells goods which florence is famous for, leather goods & souvenirs. I suggest u browse around first before making a purchase. There are more than 1 vendor selling the same thing. Best to make a full circle of the outer mercato central to view all available offerings. There are many types of leather here. If you're unsure, just ask the sellers who are predominantly bangladeshi here. My favourites are the leather wallet, handbag & accessories stalls. Souvenier are also sold here. I managed to get the firenze fridge magnet for around a euro and a half each. Not as cheap as venice or rome but like i said before, it's a one stop centre where almost all products are available and at competitive prices. If you are a muslim traveller, there are a few halal restaurants selling kebab & rice dishes. There a 1 or 2 facing the main street and 1 or 2 on the back streets. I would recommend the stall on the right as the dishes served were fresher. The halal kebab shop on the left were flexible with food quantity & mixes but some food were not that good anymore when we visited late on 1 of the nights. I would come here again in a heartbeat. The sellers are lively, buyers from all over the world and the products are quality with a huge range of goods for sale.
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Attractions|Florence: Duomo - Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore|4| “Majestic Dome the highlight of this culturally important city”|review_426334724|We visited firenze from the 8th to the 11th of sept 2016. Our airbnb location is situated 20 minutes away from the duomo. We walked there everyday as it is the centre of activity in the heart of florence city. There are many excellent gelato stalls along the way heading to the duomo. 1 such place is don nino gelato on the very sides of the duomo itself.Among other attractions nearby the duomo are sports shops, gucci, prada, souvenir shops, food restaurants, leather shops as well as gelato eateries. Note that if you're keen to buy leather products which is what florence is famous for, go visit mercato central which is 5 minutes away from the duomo.If you're looking for the bistecca ala fiorentina, most of the more affluent restaurants in the area sell it ala carte or packaged in a set with starter, wine & other delicacies. Visit inside duomo itself if you're an ardent tourist but based on a couple of reviews here. The outside of duomo is more impressive than the inside. There are plenty of local & italian peddlers selling pictures and other souvenirs. I must say that i regret not buying some of the photos which i could no longer find in my next destination in italy. If you are a muslim traveller, make sure you visit the halal kebab & bryani restaurants around mercato central. There are at least 2 on the main street and another 1-2 on the side streets. I would recommend the one on the right due to the freshness of the dishes on offer. Other attractions are just around the corner where you will get to see michaelangelo and famous and the famed work of legendary italian painters & sculptures. You can expect to queue around 30 minutes to an hour to get in. However there are short cut ways to beat the crowd. These 'agents' will approach you outside the long standard queues. The SM Novella church nearby is also an interesting place to visit as there are smaller crowds there. SM Novella itself is home to a small mall which you may find interesting bargains. If you're a shopaholic, make the trip to the factory outlet from SM Novella and i hear it's about 45 minutes trip from there to get the best designer goods. Overall we enjoyed our trip to florence whereby we made the duomo our central area of activity or base to explore the rich culture of firenze. Would happily come here again one day.

It opened my mind to the culture and uniqueness of amsterdam. One thing i admire is that despite the legalisation of many things considered a taboo in other parts of the world, the dutch people are good, friendly and open minded in general as opposed to the close minded, presumptious and voyeuristic nature of the people in my country and some surrounding neighbours. What a lovely place to visit and view first hand. I would recommend the experience to anyone and everyone.
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Hotel|Amsterdam: Hotel Casa|5| “Hardly central, but everything else was almost perfect!”|review_419211629|We stayed here for 2 nights. Took the hotel on the basis of ratings by past visitors of casa 400 and the price suits our budgetAlready took note of the non central geographical location but was still taken aback when we arrive as we expected the weather was cooler to enable us to make walks into town. Unfortunately that did not take place due to the summer heat, hence we used the metro to reach amsterdam centraal or anywhere else we wanted. Try going the opposite area as the arena (ajax fc, shopping and mall areas are superb.)Distance between the hotel & the metro is a 10 minutes walk. All well & good unless you're carrying tons of luggage & pushing a child stroller coming in & upon leaving. It takes the exact amount of time walking to the metro as it took to get and reachCentraal by metro. How's that for comparison or funfact?Going back to basics, We really enjoyed some of the basic facilities offered by the hotel. The room size was good, the bed huge, firm & comfy and the innovative platform area in the room to relax, to do work or to view the city. We were lucky to get the highest floor and an impressive view of certain parts of amsterdam. My son especially loved the platform as he spent hours there every day colouring his book, watching ipad or eating his croissant. Shower & water pressure was good and it was generally spotless clean everywhere. An important criteria for our hotel selection There is a lot of space inside the bathroom to put our toiletries and the coffee tea selection next to the kettle enough for each nite's stay. The nest outdoor lounge area looks amazing although we didn't have much time to spend there. During both nights, we came back after 12 midnite and hence, this stylish & chic chillout place had already closed. We noticed the busy crowd of visitors at nest in the mornings and in the afternoons as we were busy rushing out to go spend time visiting the beautiful amsterdam city. Didn't use the east 57 cafe and other places too but heard good reviews of the place. Being a muslim traveller, we only go for halal or vegetarian eatery these days. Had a less memorable check out experience though as a female frontline staff scolded me. Maybe she thought that i was trying to jump queue as there were people waiting to check out of casa 400 at that hour. All i wanted to know when i approached the empty left hand side of their counter is what procedures for check out and whether it was possible for me to place the bags with them as we had a gap of 2-3 hours between the noon check out time and our flight back to kuala lumpur. The blonde lady staff, on duty at 12pm on 15th september took me to task for being there and showing me a queue of visitors waiting to check out. I think her name is ms ruusje and she gave me the impression that i was one of those uninformed guests from china or any 3rd world country attempting to bulldoze my way to try beat the system. To be fair, she did try to apologise later on when i came back to collect my luggage, But by then, the damage was already done. I responded then to her that i understood if she's busy but don't have to be rude to paying customers like me. Another male staff tried to rectify things immediately after the incident. Fair play to him to trying upkeep the hotel's service reputation and standards and covering for her colleagues shortcomings. Apart from that minor incident and the location, i would give top marks for this establishment for the basic accomodation facilities it provides which was beyond our expectations. I would definitely stay here again and i would recommend any of my friends to book here.

Went there for the 1st time on sunday 21st august pm and it definitely won't be my last. The food was great, the owner friendly and the ambience was cool & cozy. Joint owner raqib came by to talk to us & gave us the heads up on this establishment and the recommended orders. Great tplace to chill and bring some friends i.e. Makan, chit chat, then lepak over coffee and cakes available. My 'chosen' meal was a yellow noodle fry with sweet mango sauce. Delicious and amazingly easy to finish. My wife thinks the nasi goreng she had will be her favourite menu here. As for drinks, I had the frap mocha, my wife had a juice drink and my son loved the ice chocolate. I've never seen him drink that much in such a short time. I enjoyed my frap mocha to the last drop as well. I would recommend the place to everyone and anyone. Kudos to the team for the job well done and see you guys soon.

The best rated hotel for our small family budget. Used the hotel for 1 night as we were recuperating from a 17 hour journey from malaysia via doha and had to catch the flight to another destination the following day. Wanted a hotel to rest after a long journey which is near enough to the airport to avoid any inconveniences. The hotel shuttle is welcome and pleasantly regular. After a short nap, the airport was a great alternative to spend a few hours, using the regular free bus as there are enough shops & restaurants at amsterdam schipol to fulfil a short chill session. The room & bathroom was sufficient enough and the additional/extra high bed was a welcome addition. My 40 month old kid loved to play his toys up there. The bed/mattress is new and it was easy for me and family to sleep in the evening and at night. On the downside, room & bathroom were small. I guess you pay for what you get but i cannot imagine a bigger guy (compared to my average asian male body) being able to survive a session in the bathroom without clattering unto something. Special mention shall be given to the charming girl working in front reception counter. She was pleasant during check in, always ready with a smile and answered all my questions readily. One of the first people i met on a short trip to amsterdam and gave a good first impression to amsterdam, holland and to the hotel. All in all, i would recommend this hotel to similar natured travellers but not to those planning to stay in amsterdam for more than a day.

Pantai chenang is langkawi and langkawi is pantai chenang. Pretty much all that you can enjoy in langkawi is here. Duty free shopping, variety of restaurants, souvenir hunting, boat trips to everywhere, watersports, massages, live music & bars. If you stay here, i don't think you even need to rent a car as everything is within walking distance. You can choose to eat italian today, local tommorow, arab the next day, fast food day after & so on. Plenty of seafood & live seafood to enjoy. Would definitely come here again & choosing to stay in a hotel in this area is a must!

That was the best advice. ”|review_368997368|Came here because my dad is a leisure holidays member. He pays for it yearly and is entitled to a few days a year in hotels like these. I did my homework. I read tripadvisor reviews before coming here. So after reading about all the lousy reviews, i lowered my expectations. It worked a treat and i'm so glad i did it. This hotel needs work. Lots of it. The units are run down, the tv room has no aircond, some furnitures are broken and the lift broke down once. I think they need to spend to improve this hotel. Probably a change of management might help. I don't think this resort has many repeat visitors. My dad came here 10 years ago and was shocked to see the state of the place now. The plus side is the location, which is pretty near the airport & padang matsirat. PM has many decent restaurants and it's less than 10 kilometers to reach pantai chenang, the main tourist area. We rented a car and you would need it if you're staying here. There are also some cheap breakfast joints on the left, after the pink bridge. The kelantan stall on the right (atv/horseride) serves good nasi lemak though the roti canai is a bit oily. A takeaway meal for 7-8 people without drinks only costs us less than myr20. All in all i would avoid this place like a plague. Better to stay in pantai cenang where there is plenty to do and you may not even need to rent a car as almost everything is there.

Front staff Ms Ling ling was very attentive. Always trying her best to accommodate & help out fr booking time right until check out. The room is very nicely decorated. It was also very clean when i checked in. location is strategic near to the city centre. For me it was ideal because it took me just 5 minutes to reach my working place and a few minutes more to reach suria sabah where i'm able to eat, shop and even watch a movie or 2 after work. Would definitely stay here again. Without a doubt.

This was based on our experience with some island resorts and there were 7 of us travelling here. The Martas hotel staff where we stayed gave us the direction to the market. It is located at the art market near the jetty. I noticed 2-3 bakso stalls and 7-8 stalls selling mixed rice. The bakso wasn't too great but we were happy with the mixed rice stall that we bought from. Idr 20k can get you a plate of rice together with 4 side dishes from the selection on display. The yet-to-be-grilled satay stuff costs 20k too. We bought bakso for 15k a packet. There are also stalls selling grilled fish. From my earlier negotiation, the price is 70-100k for a grilled red snapper (kakap) with 2 rice and a veggie dish. To me this was alright for an island resort. It wasn't our pick this time but a friend of mine told me the stall to the left had the tastiest & freshest grilled fish. Do avoid the nuttella pancake stall because 35k is way too expensive and not that delicious too. All in all, do give this place a try if you visit GT.
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Hotel|Senggigi: Dream Estate Resort|4| “Best kept secret in Kerandangan Village, Senggigi”|review_356470944|We spent 3 nights here. Booked the place as base to travel to various parts of lombok such as the beautiful waterfalls & naturally lanscaped beaches. It is quite hidden & situated in the village area of kg kerandangan in senggigiAlthough it is away from the senggigi main stretch, there are plenty of ways to make the most out of this hidden paradise. Firstly, you need to have a vehicle. A motorbike for individuals or couples and a car for families. Lombok roads are not as busy as bali so moving on your own is a good idea. Get a big car with driver if you travel in a group to enable cost sharing and comfortable to move from one place to another with enough space for luggage. An 8 seater elf with driver & petrol for 10 hours would only cost around idr 650-850k per day whilst a 6 seater pregio with the same package will be 650-700k max. The requirement for a car reminds me of when i travelled to australia in 2013 & LA years earlier. It's very much a car country. A bicycle is not sufficient unless you stay in smaller islands like gili Trawangan. The villas are very nice. Apart fr the occasional blackouts & slight distance, it was perfect for us. We travelled in a family of 7. The kitchen had enough equipments to open a small restaurant. The toilet was clean & the living room was huge as was the outside patio area. There were hardly any people using the swimming pool, so we swam quite a bit. The best part about the place is the barbecue set, sink and eating area next to it. One outsidedining area was open while the other one was closed. Great options here as well as opportunity for photo sessions here (think IG/Selfies). Of the 3 nights we were there, 1 of them we had a delicious dinner at blue ocean seafood restaurant while the other 2 nights we did our own barbecue outside using the common facilities. We had separate menus for both occasions. This we will take back the form of sweet memories of our time together. The staff are polite & decent as was the other guests staying nearby. They helped arrange massages, taxis & when they were not around, the security guy can also arrange the same. For supplies such as drinks, bread, eggs & prepaid cards, just step out to the hindu shop outside the resort. Other shops heading to the main road sells basically the same stuff too. If you are keen to use the kitchen to prepare your own meals, take advantage of the groceries lorry in the morning. You will find a lady operating a small truck packed with vege, seafood & chicken in front of the shop next door to DER every morning at 9am. Overall we will stay here again. Based on the above reasons, i'd say, why not?

Trip advisor gave plenty of tips too to ensure a meaningful first time visit. I asked annie, a relative of chef uncle gan working there on what makes the place stand out. She answered that most of the lombok seafood served in other restaurants consists of basically the same menu. Grilled fish ie ikan bakar or seafood sold in most restaurants in lombok cooked in the same gravy marinate & served with rice and their chilli/sambal accompaniment. Ocean blue, on the other hand has a wide variety of offerings. The chef is a malaysian peranakan chinese fr malacca. He is able to cook nyonya, international & lombok style dishes. He also served as chef for the brunei palace before he started this venture. The food is very tasty & reasonably pricend. A must try here is the grilled prawns in mongolian sauce, nyonya asam style steam fish & the kangkung pelicing. The coconut shake is pretty good too. Do make use of the driver facility to get to the restaurant. Give the restaurant a call and tell them the time & location of pick up. Uncle Gan, the chef & owner was nice enough to come by & chat with us after the dinner. Him, plus his team of dedicated staff made our trip memorable. By the way, we were celebrating our wedding anniversary at OB. Would love to come by and eat there again someday.

Lucky us . It is clear that they put a lot of attention to details here. The building design, the furnitures & fittings they use, the selection of the frontline team, the training to the staff, the service standard, the food quality and even the products/merchandise they use. Small stuff like tissue, toilet rolls & toiletries are of a certain quality. They go out of their way to study guest details and make them feel at home in Marta's. We came in a big group. But joanna, andy and her team of well drilled staff made sure we have every wish attended to. In the event that they could not, which by the way wasn't much, they apologized profusely & explained the reasons for doing so. Joanna & her husband, the owners have other hotels in the island. And one of them is the rinjani lodge at the foot of mount rinjani in close proximity to the famous sendang gila & tiu kelep waterfalls. Have a look at it also, i'm confident that the hotel would also have an equal, if not better service standard compared to this one. We would love to give it a try next time we come to this beautiful & natural island paradise of lombok. Unfortunately i do not have a picture of the hotel on my phone but i do have a picture of our happy family on bikes at a nearby beach arranged by andy from the front desk. Keep up the good work, joanna. You're doing a fine job. Of all the places i've visited before, i would give this place my top 3 in terms of service standard, value for money & location. It is nicely located near the party area (but not noisy) but also to the jetty, harbour, night food market & loads of restaurant choices. We will definitely come here again, without a doubt.

Therefore we chose the best hotel available near the vicinity. Holiday website reviews shows them as the best in the area but hardly nothing else to talk about. We booked 2 rooms. But one of the rooms' aircond wasn't cold enough while the other room's aircond was just sufficient. Luckily the maintenance guy came after dinner to have a look at the aircond. Rooms appear clean but one of our travel members suffered minor asthma while another person encountered some itchiness on the feet mostly. Well, i Don't like to point fingers but we really felt that there were bedbugs in the rooms. Either that or some unseen dust due possibly to low occupancy?One of the male staff was good enough to shuttle us using the hotel vehicle to a nearby nasi padang restaurant for dinner. He's a good man to assist us, but the restaurant overcharged us. We paid around idr240k+ for a 5 person meal which we felt was unacceptable. We didn't each that much and i confronted the restaurant owner abt it. This has nothing to do with the hotel, just that the driver brought us there but we suspect the driver obtained kickbacks for ferrying in hotel clients there or maybe the restaurant overcharged us seeing that we came out from a hotel transport. Is it just me or is it now avg inr50k for a nasi padang meal these days?All in all I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my friends unless they reach lombok airport in the middle of the night and simply needs a place to sleep.

In fact, this is our 3rd or 4th visit. This time, i decided to review the restaurant. We love it here. Everytime we go to Ikano/Curve area, this is one of our top 3 choices.We love it for the simple fact that it is good value for the price and the chilli is damn tasty. Try mixing the 'sambal' with the fried onion/oil accompaniment. We find that the Noodles and ingredients that come with it are well worth the value and guaranteed to fill our bellies. For small eaters, you can even share a portion with another person. It's that much. My personal favourite is the fish head noodle while my wife loves the fishball noodles with tomyam stock. The fish head portion is ample & quite fresh too. Would definitely come here again, and again..

The rooms is alright as it is still a new hotel. Heard that it is in the same group as Tiara hotel. If so, they are experienced enough in this industry in Labuan.I like the toiletries set here. It is simple but looks classier than most of those fr other hotels. The shower pressure is strong too & that makes me look forward to taking a bath here. There are 2 kinds of shower and the rainfall type is my favourite. Buffet breakfast selection is decent. I find the rendang nasi lemak tasty & the eggs made pretty well. Juices were alrite too although only 2 too choose from. Dining area was huge and the only thing i dislike is the construction view next door which is a huge part of the view. Room cleaning is prompt & they are always around the floor somewhere. This makes it easy for me to locate & inform them verbally that my room is ready for cleaning. In general, the staff team is relatively young. They appear vibrant & bubbly but requires minor refinement in customer service. Kudos to the hotel team here. I feel that this hotel, due to it's central location in between ujana & the port/town area has huge potential and is the up and coming hotel to watch in this market. All amenities are in close proximity and there is no need for a vehicle here if your business is around this area. Huge savings in that sense. I have already stayed in this hotel twice and would gladly come back here again for my next trip.

Not disappointet. At all. Had trouble finding the plc. But once called for directions, they agreed to send the hotel car to our location to escort us to the hotel. Excellent 1st impression. Rooms were spacious. But only 11 units there, so book early to avoid disappointment. Located 3-4km fr aonang beach. Straight road left fr the main road. We drove here, so not much problems to move around. Plenty of restaurants around the area. Muslim travellers have plenty of options over here. The owner, Mommy Noi & her 2 sons were fantastic. They are (especially mommy) generous and would cater for our every request and enquiry. I would like to compliment her staff, San Ma as well. She tried hard to give us the best possible service. On new year's eve, the family arranged for a pool barbeque party complete with baloons & flying tanglungs. It was indeed an awesome experience to celebrate with them and other hotel guests. What a superb opportunity it was to meet other guests fr other countries and make friends with them. The food during the bbq was delicious as well. Mommy noi ordered masaman lamb curry and it was tasty and spicy. The whole family, esp her, made us feel righr at home here. We would recommend this hotel to anyone and would love to return here someday. Kudos to this great hotel team. 
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Hotel|Ko Pha Ngan: Mangrove Villa|3| “Decent”|review_335317920|Impressive looking villas, nearby to the pier & thong sala town centre with loads of amenities. Easy to do banking, locating cheap food (at the pantip market and other stalls), renting motorbikes & other stuff here. Service was shocking at first. Maybe because we arrived late ie 9pm on xmas day. May have caught the reception fella on a bad day. He Requested to hold our passports or thb2k as a deposit. The manner in which he showed us the room was as if everything here is chargeable if we damaged it. A listing of prices for the items available to use & warned us of hair coloring effect on their bedsheets. He looked concerned as well that we brought our child although advertisements have indicated that this is a child friendly place. It was either him or a case of loss in translation?Internet service wasn't always smooth but the biggest complaint we had was the availability of hot water. It kept on failing and we probably annoyed him by calling 3 times on the 1st night to get the shower sorted. He pointed out on his 3rd visit that it could be because we were using too much power causing the failure. All we had on was a multi socket for phone charging. Thankfully, the problem was solved the following day as a mechanic was called in to resolve the issue. Another thing was that we used the pool on our 3rd day but disappointed to see the caretaker's dog having a drink on the same pool while me & son were bathing. Note that we are muslim travellers. My tip for muslim travellers is that there is a muslim restaurant near the big c supermarket in town. It is open fr noon to late every day. All in all i wouldn't stay here again. Staff needs a customer service course. They give better deals at the lovely seaview haad yao or haad son resorts on the west of this island. Better deals thru walk in as some are not listed on agoda or the other internet booking sites.

Basic facilities are all available. Toilets are clean. Toilet cleanliness is basically our main priority when looking for a hotel/apartment to stay. Some rooms have fan while others don't.We paid for an extra person, so the hotel put in an extra double bed on top of the one already available. Ms Linda showed and brought us to our room.The eletricity service left much to be desired. Not allowed to use high consuming eletricals such as rice cooker, water heater or hairdryer. I believe this is due to the limited capacity of the power generator at the hotel. Signage pertaining to this is shown near the front desk but it inconvinienced us greatly, more so because we brought our toddler who demands milk every few hours and our preference for instant noodles :).Breakfast was decent. Normal spread with main dishes of fried rice or noodles or kuay teow. As a local traveller, i feel that the hotel could have improvised on this by offering the popular nasi lemak or other famous local delicacies such as nasi dagang or nasi berlauk. We feel that the hotel may be keeping the menu simple as it looked the same from day to day.The hotel beach was good but somewhat limited. Tuna bay beach next to us is broader and have nice white sand, but on busy days, we were not allowed to hang around or bath there as it was claimed private. They have many tourists themselves and thus we had to move further left nearer to the marine park jetty. But the whole coast in this part of perhentian besar is beautiful and offers many good spots to snorkel without having to pay extra for a boat ride.The restaurant is one of the main attraction of this place. Unfortunately there was an unpleasant event during our first dinner on Saturday 12th Sept 2015. 2 male staff in charge of seafood barbeque were pretty rude. They may have been busy handling a group order that night but the least they can do is answer us properly sinece we as paying guests. The perpetrators are a dark malay guy and a glum looking & silent chinese guy. The kelantanese and terengganu people have much to learn about customer service from their thai counterparts north of the border. We have been to koh samui, phuket and krabi before and have never encountered such rudeness.On the last night, we had a birthday dinner at the restaurant and was served way better than the other day. Food came fast. The recommended dishes are the Seabass 3 rasa and the breaded fried calamari with sweet thai chilli sauce. Watermelon juice is pretty good too. Special mention to tall dark and handsome hotel waiter/worker Encik Wan for handling our orders that night superbly.Earlier in the day, he also took some time to bring bananas & show some squirrel feeding to my toddler son.Finally, credit should go where credit is due. Ms Linda at the front desk/reception is the outstanding staff attending each matter dilligently and satisfactorily. We broke our hot water flask and she insisted it was ok. But we proceeded to replace it anyway.The lady owner was also helpful. She upgraded our room once a sea view room became available. she even gave us the option of choosing between 2 rooms and alternative locations. for this gesture made us appreciate the hotel more.
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Hotel|Labuan Island: Billion Waterfront|4| “Good Value”|review_308856875|I would normally take dorsett for my labuan stay. But i had to choose waterfront this time because of mgmt directive. What i found was that for the price paid, it was good value. With 150 extra, i get dorsett with a sea view room, better gym and more range of food at the cafe, but that's about it. So you decide if the extras are worth it for that price. My stay was short, i found waterfront more than sufficient for my stay. The service here is warm. I used to stay here for 9 weeks in 2011. Surprised to find that some hotel staff still recognised me. Service level was pretty good. The food spread, although less than dl, is sufficient. Rendang was a little oily but they have nasi lemak and egg station too. The sambal is slightly inferior but i guess it would be nitpicking to say that. Service at the cafe was warm too. Met some ppl fr the labuan market and some fr outside. Had a nice chat with them and made some friends. Ujana is a short walk away. And so is the taxi service. Taxi is also on call at the hotel. So distance & accesibility is not a problem. The pool is big and awesome. Best in labuan, in my opinion. I would recommend this place to anyone except serious gym goers.

It was an unexpected event. And the location was in the Bayan Baru Teluk Kumbar area. As there were many making the trip, i could not think of anyplace else other than vistana hotel. Booked the 2 bedroom apartment immediately.Arrived late as the event finished late. There were a couple of rooms available, so asked the girl for a more scenic room rather than the 8th floor apartment she intended to give us. Alas, we were given the room on the 17th floor with a view of the Penang Bridge and Pulau Jerjak.We liked the hotel! the view was good and was extremely pleased to discover they had refurbished the apartment too. Came here in 2009 or 2010 but was rather unimpressed back then. I suppose any recently renovated hotel gives a rather diffent feel to the tenants.Almost everyone enjoyed the hotel and we took some good pictures here too.As i took the non breakfast option, had to go down and buy breakfast for the gang. Encik Lan at the front door gave us directions to the original kayu restaurant nearby. his advise was that the restaurant was so near we wouldn't even break sweat. He was right. And the roti canai & teh tarik served here was pretty damn good.At the room, there weren't any plates. So we requested for some plates from the front desk. They entertained our request and we had a good penang style roti canai breakfast that day. Even brought back 3 teh tarik packets for gd measure.All in all it was a good booking. Planning to book again somewhere in Oct or November this year with the family members,Nothing negative to review apart from some dusts nearby the tv cabinet area. Seeing that the room is clean, it is probably dust gathered over the last few days as i predict the room is clean but no tenants for a couple of days.
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Hotel|Jakarta: Holiday Inn Express Jakarta Thamrin|4| “Comfortable for a short business trip”|review_267988083|I stayed in this hotel fr 21st to 23rd April 2015. It was a short business trip as i had a seminar at a hotel nearby during the 21st. That hotel was fully booked during the date concerned. Turns out that there was an asia africa conference in jakarta & bandung that week, so a couple of top rated hotels were fully booked. Checked in late on tuesday 21st as we took a late flight fr KL to Jakarta. Flight was delayed a good 45 minutes too so we ended up arriving very late here. The good part of arriving late is that bags were cleared very fast, taxi was available and no traffc jam (macet) to the hotel. Took us half an hour to reach the hotel. At the hotel, check in was easy and as requested, we got a room facing the main Sudirman road and a higher floor. I think the jakarta traffic and nearby buildings make for a better view than having a view of other buildings close up. Good tip by travel advisor!The hotel room was not spacious but the room had all the basics you would need. You may need to call housekeeping to request for iron, ironing board and some toiletries. I arrived late and was too tired to iron so i asked for the VIP pressing service to allow me to wear my crumpled shirt for the training in a few hours time. Bed was very comfy and i had a quality sleep. Awakened at 6.30 am to the jakarta traffic sounds. Funny that at 1am when i arrived, the road was almost completely deserted. Breakfast was sufficient. On my 1st day, they served nasi goreng with other standard hotel menu and on the 2nd day, it was buttered rice with soto ayam with the other stuff remaining the same. If i had stayed in the same hotel for a week, i would prob get bored with the breakfast. But here i was staying here for 2 days and enjoyed my breakfast experience throughly. The best thing about the hotel is it's close proximity to 2 huge shopping malls, Grand Indonesia & Plaza Indonesia. There are many other places to visit here as the sudirman main road provided for a great platform to travel places. Getting a taxi was easy. You can flag one by the roadside or ask the concierge guys to do it. Grand Indonesia was so near that you don't require a taxi to go there, unless you hate the fumes and pollution. We visited hard rock cafe Jakarta at Pacific Place (another good mall!) and it was probably on the same main road. I wanted nasi padang for lunch and the taxi brought me to the sederhana restaurant which was near to the pacific place. Try this itinirerary if you guys plan to catch a souvenier at HRC and enjoy some quality indonesian food nearby. Tanah Abang market is nearby this hotel and it took ya 10-20 mins to get there. Managed to buy all the textile and clothing required for our next few festivities and wedding invitations. There are a huge range to choose from and prices are negotiable. On the last day after check out, my luggage was safely kept by the front desk staff as i had a couple of hours to kill while waiting for my evening taxi for flight to the airport.Overall, i had a short but hugely satisfying trip to Jakarta. Thank you HIE for providing the base for an efficient outing. I would definitely stay here again next time.

I have never stayed here before. What interests me about this hotel is it's central location. It is near to the dried seafood market, the handicraft market, the open seafood grilled stalls and a couple of small malls nearby like Warisan, Centre Point and others. I think there's a new mall called Oceanus but i didn't have the time to visit there. The night life centre is also nearby. I heard BED is good, but i've not had the chance to stay there during my short trip.What impressed me the most is the size of the room. It is very spacious and comfy (see picture). It was a very cozy place to stay with a huge window & clear view of the city. My room was facing KK town.Transport was pretty easy. There are hotels downstairs to go places which are a bit further away.The thing i don't like is that there is no free WIfi here. Given the chance, i would love to stay here again. But i may give other hotels near Suria Sabah a try too because i like this mall and the GSC cinema here.

Premier hotel choice in labuan. Location nicely situated at the corner of financial park where most of the business activities are taking place. Walking distance to a couple more restaurants, blue wave cafe and other amenities. Food choice at the brassieri is ample but quality of cooking is not of KL standard. However, food are relatively fresh, esp seafood. In Labuan, the standard of freshness is high due to the island nature and location. Had steam siakap during the lunch buffet today and the quality is as good as anywhere. The rooms are nice and spacious and the wifi is free, but speed of internet leaves a lot to be desired. Normally i have a favourite room location here and will try to get the same room area whichever the floor is. Hint: my room is 404 .The bar here is pretty decent and drinks are cheap in line with the island's tax free status. Of course the hotel prices are higher than elsewhere but still cheaper than kl drink prices. The lounge is seaview and it's relaxing to chill during sunset time. The staff are also friendly here esp the girls at the reception. All in all i would definitely come here again. Choices are not many but among them, this is the best of the best in labuan.
azrin_zabri|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Hotel|Kuala Lumpur: DoubleTree by Hilton Kuala Lumpur|4| “Cozy bed & accessible to anywhere in KL city”|review_259912112|Spent a nite here on the 14th of March. Since i'm a member of the hilton club, i decided to use the voucher entitlement to spend my 5th yr anniversary dinner here. The booking was easily made thru the club and although booked just 2-3 wks earlier, and during the start of the school holidays, the dates were available. The room was nice and clean. More for couples and small families as there were some sharp edges unsuitable for children. The bathroom was transparent from the bed side but shutter/roller allows it to be opened and closed depending on what you fancy. This gave a nice high tech edge to the room. The bathroom rain shower is pretty good and i aleays enjoy bathrooms with rain shower. It's the satisfaction enjoyed during shower when plentiful amounts of water comes down like rain. Mind you it was pretty dry season in KL during march. The view was not so great. A view of the building next door and jalan damai behind jalan tun razak did not make for good viewing. Since i got this room on a complimentary basis, i guess i'll not complaim too much about the viewTv channels were ample and we caught up with one or two good movies during our stay. Given the king size beds given, and tv in front of it, it was really cozy to tuck in a couple of hours under the sheets watching a nice show in between meals or after waking up pre breakfast. All in all, i would say that one great thing about the hotel is it's location. There are some good shops in the intermark mall where the hotel is situated. You can get your grocery stuff at village grocer, coffee at san francisco and other coffee joints, sports shopping at the recently open sports direct store and plenty more. We had dinner at red lobster for the first time since it opened here in KL. I had planned to go many times but staying here in hilton double tree gave me an excellent opportunity to do so and boy did we have an awesome seafood dinner that night. A new club just opened next door to red lobster and it looks quite happening & grandThe hotel is also close to the ampang park lrt and the ampang park mall. Altho the mall is dated, you can just take the train to klcc one stop away. Parking was enough and you could also easily flag a taxi to go anywhere from this very central location in kl.Overall i would stay here again and recommend others to come give it a try.

Went to Bicester Village on the 22nd december. So, i'm entitled to an opinion and to make comparisons. The great thing about La Vallee is that it is connected with the main line of RER A heading to the same direction as disneyland. This makes it so much more accessible unlike BV which requires a separate train system fr marylebone to bicester north. La vallee village is a mall's walk away fr the station which means it offers mall shopping ie a little extra for people who don't enjoy outlet shopping. The mall is fairly huge too with auchan and a large sports shop inside. In between the mall & la vallee, i was informed there is a good churros stall but we missed it as our toddler was having tantrums (too long shopping time by the adults?) . A good advantage of la vallee is the french outlets such as longchamp, miu miu and the others. This was unavailable in the english outlets. No LV here but i'll suggest champs elysees and galerie la fayette for that. Longchamp has gd value though limited stock. I spend quite a bit in ralph lauren as there was no queue here unlike the BV one so choosing and lining up to try clothes at the changing room was not a major hassle.

Chose to omit the iconic 26th as the crowd is too large, long queues everywhere, tough parking and jammed town. Given the circumstances, 22nd was our choice of course. Buying train tickets not difficult fr london (marylebone). Just go online and buy chiltern rail return ticket with shuttle coverage fr bicester north to shopping heaven ie village. Also, having visited La Vallee on the 17th dec, i feel i have the right to compare these 2 outlets. As a guy even, i felt there were good deals everywhere. I did not go thru all the shops but ferragamo, hugo boss & coach had very attractive deals! Wanting to stretch my budget, ferragamo was the place i chose to spent my limited dollar in . But the trip back was not pleasant as i also kept thinking of the boss & coach items. Would have bought it had it not been in the same category of items as SF. Since i went to ralph lauren in vallee and spent a small fortune over there, i didn't go in to the one in BV. The queues i read on trip advisor of the PRL shop in BV is absolutely correct. No such queue in La Vallee. That may also mean that BV may have had the better deals but i care less now that i have bought more than 5 shirts in the parisian outlet. My wife informed me that prada & burberry also had good stuff here. Only longchamp and a few french brands are therefore worth buying in la vallee. So go here if u have to make a choice. No LV shops in both FO's, i'm afraid. Toilets were available and shuttle servive to the train was always there. Facility fr VAT refunds too if you're non EU so no complains. Reasonable eateries include pret a manger & a crepe shop. Thai busaba looked affordable too but we chose for 100% shopping time as we brought our owned packed lunch cooled all the wat fr our bayswater apartment. Definitely will come again, with extra ammunition and better know hows, of course.

A bit difficult for my small family in there because pushchairs/strollers were not allowed due to the staircasing. So had to carry our toddler around and if tired had to allow him to walk around in the busy place. On the plus side, the staff were friendly and cheerful. The spirit of xmas was there as we visited on the 23rd of february. We came a few days after the jennifer lawrence mockingjay wax came in which made wifey happy. There are plenty of opportunities for photo taking although some were more popular than others. Overall, i had a good time but i don't think i'll be coming again in the foreseable future.

Many rides & attractions in a small place.If planned properly, it is possible to cover all rides with just the regular ticket. There is a path around the lake, for getting to the rides quickly, instead of going by the regular path. Keep walking around to see rides having minimum wait times & grab if reasonable. Ponchos may be needed, as it rains unexpectedly. Prepare to queue up for food in the eating joints.

The eggs possibly hatch few at a time & the volunteers possibly release the hatchlings in to the sea whenever appropriate. You may not be there at the time of hatching or while releasing. Did not see even one baby turtle during my visit during this season.While volunteers may be doing some good work behind the scenes, this event in Velas is hyped up. There may be better alternative sites to witness the baby turtles venturing into the sea.Velas beach itself had extremely dark chocolate coloured sand, is broadly untouched by development and may be good for some short walks or brief family sports.

Swami Vivekananda's association with this place makes it further more important. During season, expect long queues for the boat ride to the Rock. Ticket counter may close early because of the rush (say at 1 pm, for the ride at 4 pm), so plan properly.

Kids were tired after travel & lotsa running around the previous night and were too tired to wake up early to see the sunrise the next morning. So, they just popped up their heads on bed, saw the sunrise (which was fabulous, especially thru binocs) and went back to sleep. The views from these rooms were great, especially during early night, when Vivekananda Rock & Thiruvalluvar Statue, which are close by, were lit up. Dinner service at the restaurant was good & the food quite decent.

So took up & down trips between Ooty & Coonoor. Unlike the Shimla or Matheran hill trains, these coaches just have seating space, which may not be sufficient for heavy luggage. In a short train ride like this, taken more for the experience than movement from one place to another, one expects at least the stations to be a little bit festive & selling snacks. But no, not here. Bring Your Own Munchies, force cuddle up with family and relax!I heard the Mettupalayam to Coonoor is pleasant, but may be next time I will try booking early!

The online booking process works. Go to the temple early, with your booking paper & id proof. Go without footwear or other articles in the morning, but carry some biscuits & may be a small water bottle, especially if you have kids, as the wait is long. There are large viewing galleries on different floors, where devotees can sit & watch the arti. If you are late, you may only get an angled view of the abhishek. Rent or take a metal mug for water abhishek. The old Mahakaleshwar idol is relatively free of crowd and you can yourself perform water abhishek to your heart's content. Drinking water available inside the temple tastes great!

Went out with speed boat (which was good), small group is a positive. The diving scene was nice. In the end, we wasn't sure if the dinner was included in the price but when we left no one was telling us anything. Quite disappointed when we got home and double checked their website and turned out that we could have had dinner. Overall we didn't feel that we were taken care of....maybe better if they divided English and Croatian speaking groups to get everyone involved.

Cleverly designed storage and modern controls of lighting and A/C make this somewhat the ultimate travel room. It's very small and compact, but most things you need are there and in turn with the small size of the room the cost is much less than staying in hotels of similar standards. The staff were friendly, check in Easy. The one criticism I would give is that each day they would take away the two towels we had used and then leave only one...a mystery to me, you can call reception via the phone app as the room does not have a phone. Overall I enjoyed the stay as the location is great next to the station and the price was good.

We have visited Browns in other cities across the UK, so it seemed like a good choice. The vegetarian nutroast was delicious, it's nice to find a restaurant that caters as well for us veggies as it does for meat eaters. The only item I had a problem with were the Yorkshire Puddings which were so oily that I left them, but maybe this was a one off. We will visit again i'm sure.

The restaurant itself is compact-so book in advance as it gets busy! They have recently added an outdoor area to the front which is great in the summer months. The menu has a great selection of dishes, and a good amount of vegetarian options. Daily specials are posted on the board and a nice dessert cabinet hosts a selection of delicious looking cakes. The food comes out when ready and you never feel rushed which is nice. The service is just as good as the food which makes the whole restaurant work like clockwork. As it mainly opens for daytime offerings, they do open slightly later at the weekends which is nice. It would be great if they opened later all week round, but I guess when you have something that works and is busy then why change! We will be back soon.

We visited as a group of 5 and everybody enjoyed the food, service and decor the restaurant had to offer. The hand battered cod and chips being a favourite of the group. Good sized portions of fish. The burgers were not so good-slightly overdone and a big lack of any quantity of garnish/sauce. As a vegetarian they allowed me to have the Sweet Potato and bean burger as part of the set menu. I know this is a steakhouse, but they could do more for vegetarians as the set menu really did lack any choices as there was only one main, something I hope they will change in the future. Overall a lovely meal and we will return again in the future.

The food arrived quickly and had great flavour, they also offer Vegetarian options. Beer was available on Draught which is always nice to see in a curry house. The service was good, but a little bit over familiar at times, with constant jokes about brining the wrong food, funny the first time but then it got a bit boring. The prices are fair and the portions are of a good size. I actually returned the same week as the food was really good. I will be back in the future.

It's certainly worth a bit of time (and money) to go up the tower as the views are really good. Make sure you go on a clear day when it isn't raining to really appreciate how far you can see. On the top you can travel in the 'Bubble Car' be sure to buy this with the ticket you choose as it's a great way to go around the top of the tower, whilst hanging slightly over the side of the building. Equally at night the tower lights up and it really is a great photo opportunity.

The menu is in English and Chinese and the staff also speak perfect english. My friend is Vegan and there were many options for him which is good. We had the Samosa and Potato Chilli, I cannot recommend the later enough, it really was delicious. For mains we had a Tikka Masala and a veg curry-equally tasted great. They also do delivery via KK rabbit which is good. Prices are reasonable. I will be visiting again.

After some searching online I came across China Travellers and it sounded perfect-not many tourists and small groups on the tour. In the two days we walked along the wall we must have only seen 30 other people. It felt like we had the entire wall to ourselves. Sonia was great at answering any questions we had before and from the pickup to the drop-off back in Beijing the whole experience was fantastic. We had good weather and could see the stars in the evening, and breathtaking views of the wall in the daytime. The equipment provided was all in great condition and the food was also excellent. It was nice that we didn't feel rushed and everybody got chance to make there own experience. I would recommend packing light! the camping equipment although not massively heavy still add's to the already tough walk up the wall in places, but the views are the reward! Take a camera! I took my drone to fly and got some amazing footage and had plenty of time to do this and take photos once at the camping area.

TravellingLX|ED77F33C4433E0D4504AA02CBA08DD52|Attractions|Shanghai: Shanghai Tower|3| “Wasn't that impressed”|review_483075829|I've visited quite a few observation decks around the world and I found this one quite disappointing. The queue to go up in the lifts can be up to an hour so make sure you arrive early if you want to be up for Sunset. There is also a nice exhibition about the history of the skyscraper in the basement before you go up to the top, so factor in around 30 to 40mins to look around this, I personally found this more interesting than the observation deck itself. There was a busy crowd at the top and with such large amount of people and children the windows were really dirty. Don't go up the tower if it's not a really clear day as the view won't be good at all. Another tip is to not make any reservations close to your visit to the tower as the queue for the lift down was around an hour. The price is expensive for the overall experience in my mind.

The restaurant serves excellent inventive vegetarian and vegan food, in an upmarket environment, different from the other offerings in Shanghai. I would recommend this for anybody entertaining vegetarian and vegan business clients, friends or relatives it's a really nice restaurant with great food. The staff speak little English which is a slight let down, however they have hired more English speaking staff recently, so are clearly trying to improve on this. I can highly recommend, slightly pricey but worth it.

Also do good offers in the week such as buy one get one free on Burgers on Monday and buy a scoop of ice cream get one free on Wednesday. The cakes from the attached Al's Bakery are very good. Milkshakes are a must! Staff speak little english, but still great service and free Wifi
TravellingLX|ED77F33C4433E0D4504AA02CBA08DD52|Hotel|Shanghai: Howard Johnson Huaihai Hotel Shanghai|3| “Good Location but terrible Internet and Air Con”|review_481660546|I have stayed at this hotel for the past few weeks, so i've had a good opportunity to use most of the hotel amenities. Unfortunately one of the main problems is that the staff speak little to no english, therefore if there is a problem then you have no way to communicate to get it solved, yes I could learn Chinese, but I would expect a hotel of this standard to have at least one english speaking member of staff on duty. The rooms are really hot, if you like a nice cool room overnight then you may find that you will struggle to sleep as although the rooms have individual air conditioning panels the system is centrally controlled and doesn't cool the rooms much lower than 24 degrees. The bed is comfy and furnishings although slightly dated are in good condition. Although smoking is banned in the hotel several guests still seem to smoke indoors, and the hotel don't seem that bothered. Wifi is terrible, don't expect to get any work done that involves using the internet, if this is crucial then stay in a different hotel. The breakfast is nice, plenty of hot options and cold juices and an egg station. Overall the location is good and transport links to the metro is only a short walk, wifi and air con ruined my stay in this hotel. If i was paying for the hotel personally I would be disappointed.

There is a minimum spend of 200CNY per person if you are not a hotel guest. The music is really nice, great acoustics and the lady who was singing was equally excellent. Worth a visit if you are near.
TravellingLX|ED77F33C4433E0D4504AA02CBA08DD52|Restaurant|Shanghai: Mr & Mrs Bund-Modern Eatery by Paul Pairet|4| “Good to find a real late night restaurant”|review_481376868|I love that Mr & Mrs Bund opens late on Thursday, Friday & Saturday (Until 2am!) It's rare to find such quality dinning that offers this. The restaurant has a great feel and the music is at a perfect level so that you can still enjoy a conversation but not so quiet that there is no atmosphere. The views from the outside balcony are also great and perfect for a photo of Pudong. There is a great late night set menu of two or three courses, and the options are plentiful. Drink options were also great and buy one get one free on Cocktails at night. My main criticism and the one thing thats lost the extra rating is that there are no vegetarian options on the set menu for the main course. This is disappointing from a restaurant of this type. I would like to visit again to try the full menu.
TravellingLX|ED77F33C4433E0D4504AA02CBA08DD52|Restaurant|Shanghai: M on the Bund|2| “Very disappointing, better places out there”|review_480857873|Firstly I would like to say that it's extremely rare that I give a restaurant a poor rating, however the service we received at M on the Bund was terrible. I actually contacted the restaurant via email to let them know my comments, however they didn't even bother to respond. First impressions were good, we were shown to a lovely table by the window which did have great views, unfortunately from this point onwards the experience wasn't good at all. After eventually ordering after waiting forever for the waiter, our starters arrived, both very pleasant. Once the starters were finished we ventured outside to take some photos, but were surprised when we returned that the plates had not been cleared. We then sat for at least another 15 minutes with the empty starter plates in front to the point where the main course arrived and the waiter had to take it back as there was no room on the table to put it down, he then cleared the plates and set the main course out. My partner had been given a bred knife for the lamb dish and again the wait to get this changed seem like forever. The lamb was tough and the portion was small. The waiter also did not suggest any side dishes when he took the order so when the rather small main courses arrived we then needed to order further dishes, only one of these ever turned up and we decided at this point that we wouldn't have a desert as we didn't want to give anymore custom to the restaurant. It seems many people visit here for the view of Pudong which is the best part of this restaurant in my opinion, but I would recommend going elsewhere as the food and the terrible service is not worth the money. The wine selection was good but overall we were really disappointed.

It was such good fun and at the same time educational in the type and style of Chinese cooking. Mike speaks perfect english and the paperwork is very well prepared meaning you can take home the recipes and make them again. All the ingredients we used were very fresh and easy to find locally not only in China but most places around the world. We made three dishes in the two hour class and we were able to have a large lunch from them and also take one away for eating another time. I can highly recommend, even if in Shanghai for a short time.

The zoo is extremely well kept, the enclosures are really great and the animals look happy and relaxed. It's so nice to see some of the animals roaming so freely such as the orangutans. It's a great place to bring children so they can understand what types of animals are in the world and how we can help to protect and look after them

The park was not so busy and the most we queued up for was around 40 mins. Most rides we walked straight on to. The food in the park was also nice. Staff were friendly and the park was very clean. Would certainly visit again or another Six Flags park. Very Impressed. Try Twisted Colossus it's brilliant!

The building itself is HUGE and it's a real shame that the inside is in real need of updating. I would not waste any time here.

The pizza bagel is great and the cream cheese is yummy. It feels a bit dirty inside, but no worse than most of this kind of takeaway in China. Good if you are in a rush as a standard bagel only takes 5 mins to make.

As a vegetarian I was pleased they had some options for me, I went with the pumpkin spaghetti which I can recommend. Juices are good, but like most places in Shanghai they are expensive.

As we had not eaten during the day we were both starving. The starters we ordered were delicious I can highly recommend the falafel. It was also nice to have a refreshing Mocktail which was suggested by our sever Hamilton. The main courses were equally tasty I had a mushroom pizza and my partner had the Leg of Lamb which was extremely small considering it was the most expensive item on the menu. For desert I can Dec one thing the wood cooked strawberries which were fantastic. The service from Hamilton was fantastic. We would visit again.

It was difficult to find the entrance gate as there were roadworks. You pay $10.25 to gain entry for a car and you are given a map with information about each of the stopping points. The route is very well set out and the information provided is good. We managed to see some seals and cubs which was really nice and plenty of other wildlife along the way. If you eat at one of the golf resorts you can claim the entrance fee back from the cost of the meal which is good. I can recommend 'The Bench' restaurant at stop 19-The Lodge at Pebble Beach.

The check in staff were friendly and told us all the information about the hotel. The room was ok, clean sheets and tidy. The bathroom was missing a lip into the shower which revealed all the dirt underneath. Internet was free and was quick enough for emails and general browsing. The breakfast could do with some upgrading. The hot food was nothing special and everything was on paper plates with plastic cutlery-not so great for the environment so they could do better on this.

The room was nice and clean, the bed was comfy. There is no air conditioning just a ceiling fan not so much of a problem at the moment, but I can imagine in summer it gets very hot. There is local musicians playing music in the lobby and the hotel offers free wine at this point usually from 5pm each night, worth a visit. Car parking is expensive at the hotel, but on the corner of the next block there is a car park which charges $22 per day, it's only a two min walk so much cheaper parking there.

For the best experience walk or take a cycle, don't drive it's not worth it. If you walk you get the best views of the city as the walking lane is closest to the city side. However cycling the bridge is fun and there are many shops down at fisherman's wharf that rent cycles either by the hour or by the day. If you decide to cycle you can carry on past the bridge to Sausalito and then get on the ferry with the bike back.

They told us you have to buy mineral water from us then only glass will be provided. It's not that we can't buy water from your restaurant but seriously which expensive fine dining restaurant does that give me a single name ? . Since we were on our way to Ulluwati and were tired after long water sports we decided just to eat food and go.

Food was awesome and Rajaji (resort caretaker) has again scored perfect 10 in making this trip memorable. In fact, i forgot my Pan card at the restaurant which Rajaji has arranged to send through courier..this shows his commitment towards guest. There was not much crowd in Kasauli but this hotel was fully occupied.

I am highly impressed by the service staff Ankush and Wasim, the restaurant was full but they were really quick in service and took care of all the guest. We were impressed by the particular care they took to see to it that had a wonderful birthday dinner.Ankush helped us with the formality of food waiver form etc because we were carrying our own cake. I am really thankful to management for understanding the special occasion.We had north indian food , Dal Tamra is one of the best and overall food preparation for both veg and non veg is awesome. To sum up one of the best restaurant experiences we have had-- to date-- .  Highly recommended!
ashishrawat12|51B63B4CAA8775F4F7C4B8F109B5605F|Hotel|Chorla: Wildernest|4| “Must visit for Nature lovers”|review_327045757|I am not touching on the comments/compliments which guest has already provided. No doubt its a must visit property but you need atleast 2 days to enjoy the nature. Transport team is amazing and their cost is very reasonable as compared to other transport operators whose only agenda is to loot customer. Imp point for travellers this property is in GOA so if anyone says they have to pay Karnataka state tax then pls avoid. The entry of this property is from GOA but some part of property lies in Maharashtra and Karnataka. If you are going with small kids then pls do keep odomos and mosquitos patches as this is inside a jungle. Do try their BAR its very reasonable. Lastly there is ZERO phone signals so bring your own satellite phones if you have to make urgent call. Overall a very nice experience
ashishrawat12|51B63B4CAA8775F4F7C4B8F109B5605F|Hotel|Calangute: Estrela Do Mar Beach Resort|3| “Not so bad.. if you want beach side hotel you can try this.”|review_327044727|We had booked 4 standard rooms for 3 nights in this property. We got decent rooms near pool. Overall our experience was good since the accessibility to beach is from the property itself. One of my friend noticed that there is a cremation ground just opposite the entry of the hotel but it is not visible. I found that service people try very hard to meet the demand of the guest which is a positive sign. We asked for mosquitto replent and spray in our room which is arranged in no time. Even at midnight they helped us with medical emergency 5 star for that too. Since this is near beach lot of dust come over but sweeper and cleaning staff do their best to keep the property clean so no complaints on that. I had a problem with Reservation team no one served us welcome drink , we all 4 couple checked in at different time and none of us got the welcome drink. We booked this hotel through online site and booked room on daily basis for 3 nights as it was cheaper. Somehow one of my friend erreneously booked one room with single occupancy and hotel charged exorbitant price for double occupancy which spoiled our mood. There is no connectivity of mobile signals in this hotel, although this is a problem with whole Calangute area. Last but not least food is good. Overall i will give 3.5 rating to this hotel.

I really liked the ambience and overall decor of the hotel. Breakfast spread is huge and Kangan restaurant is equally good. Try Dal Kangan if you havent ..I am a vegetarian but my colleague liked the non veg food..I really like the combo which offers mix of veg and non veg ..like a thali.... Dont forget to get a real Kangan which is made live by a guy who just sits out of kangan restaurant ...its complimentary :) ...Overall a very good experience...Vivek did his best to serve us on time... Mostly restaurant is full so try to come early or reserve your travel. GYM area can be improved.. no trainer or co ordinator was present during my 4 days of stay morning/evening time.. one of the stepper was not working and no one put a notice regarding same. Gym equipments specially treadmill and stepper need a maintenance..Overall good experience not deducting any point for my stay

This is right in heart of the city you can walk anywhere from this place. Special thanks to shuttle service guy who drove me to the country side 6-7 miles away for coin laundry on my request (sorry i forgot his name). He is very friendly and helpful. Reception staff is equally good, very prompt and responsive. Every day i walk into clean and comfortable room thanks to house keeping...10/10 to this hotel basis the pricing, location and comfortable stay.

I tried to step out for a walk but its surronded by Highway. Although all the staff have a good service attitude and they are very prompt in answering the request. They do have a shuttle service which can drop you at nearby CVS or 24x7 or station(i did used it once). A small section within reception has a counters from where you can pick water, cold coffee, sandwiches etc which is good. Breakfast you have to pay not included and they vending machine at each floor which ice dispensor (surpisingly NO water). Anyways a decent 3 days stay and i have an average experience nothing great to talk about.

My colleague and we both went for few drinks on 16 May i paid the bill of $ 28.23 through my card. When i reached back hotel i received another message that 41 dollar is again charged on my card. Since my hotel is near i went there and met with Restaurant Manager she shows me all the bill for that particular steward and i pointed the charge slip of $ 28.23 which was genuine transaction. She apologised and assured me that on 18 May (Monday) she will take of this additional charge since 16th being Saturday lot of people are around. I was assured that she would be doing the necessary reversal or speak to bank for reversal of charge. After 20 days , this charge is still reflecting on my card account and finally i have to put a dispute with by bank for $ 41 dollar charge. I am highly surprised that such a super rater restaurant has no service attitude this is when personally visited the restaurant again and informed manager that i am not from United States. Terrible experience and still co ordinating with bank to get this charge reversed.

Location is awesome facing nagin lake and hari parbat. Enjoy evening tea or morning tea at their huge garden. They have two chefs who are with them for 15-20 yrs and i must say each dish they prepare has his own kashmiri taste. For non vegetarians its the only place to eat. Best of luck to you guys who are doing such a wonderful job and keeping the place intact after so much of damage during the flood. I will come soon.

One of the places that we have enjoyed the most was the visit to the Universal Studios. Indeed, the place was very inviting. This amusement place made me bring myself to my childhood. The venue was not just for children to enjoy but also for the adults to make memories with family and friends.In reference to cleanliness and orderliness, its truly amazing that you can never see litter around. The staff/ employees were very accommodating and friendly. The service was excellent. I feel like going back again to Singapore and bring my kids with me to feel how lucky they are as children and how fortunate they are to enjoy life as it is.Universal Studios Singapore does not only offer quality services, they provide memories to cherish and pride to uphold.

Rooms were tidy and spacious. Our room wasn't ready on check in and we did wait 10-15 minutes but thats no biggie. Sandbar restaurant was a little slow on serving food (although the restaurant was packed) and the meals were quite small for the money paid. the breakfast buffet was delicious. I love the train which takes you to and from the barge - very cute. Overall a fantastic experience! We will be back :)

Staff were unable to explain the menus to us and were rather blunt/not interested. The food was delicious however a little boring, rather expensive for stir fried meat and plain rice. The chef was great and did little tricks but it felt rushed and fake. At the end splitting the bill was a nightmare...we had to work out our own amounts and tell the lady how much we wanted to pay. I have eaten at some great teppenyaki in my time and this one was a bit of a let down :(

The restaurant was packed which is generally a good sign! However I noticed most meals were left unfinished which was a slight concern. First of all, the cocktails were great! Secondly, the service was great! However the food was a let down. The meals were oversized and unfortunately lacked attention and flavour. I had a chicken, pumpkin, avocado pasta which severely lacked chicken and the avocado was scarce (maybe like three pieces), lots and lots of penne though!! My partners caesar salad was ok but lacked dressing and the tortilla shell was dry and oily. I think the menu is way to big and maybe a smaller, well thought out menu would be better. Congratulations to friendly staff though, you would be the reason I returned.

However, the atmosphere is great and all the staff were extremely lovely and friendly. Now to the best part.... The Beef Wellington I had for dinner was by far the best meal I ate in our whole two weeks in NZ and maybe even one of the best meals I've ever eaten. I know, its steak wrapped in pastry, how good could it be? I absolutely fell in love. Would travel back to Queenstown to eat this meal again. Compliments to the chef!

Lots of pools, slides, play equipment, well kept amenities and even a swim up bar!! However, the staff were extremely rude and charged us an absolute fortune for a powered camp site, even after we were told incorrect pricing on the phone and questioned it at check in, the ladies response was "well it pays for you to ask questions". After checking there online booking system we found we had been overcharged $80, but no explanation from them and there was no way in hell they were going to reimburse us. Bins were not emptied for three days, there was rubbish all over the ground and maggots on the bins. We were also not allowed more than one car at our campsite even though we paid an absolute fortune for our 4m x 4m dirt patch. They have left an extremely bad impression on us and there is no way in hell we will be back. We love Yamba and will be finding somewhere else to stay when we return.

We ordered two breakfast meals and two coffees. My breakfast meal was missing the two pieces of toast the menu promised and my partners breakfast was missing toast and hash browns the menu promised. When asking a waitress for the toast & hash browns, she took over five minutes to bring them back and slapped it on the table, no smile or apologies. We also only received one piece of toast and no hash browns. We had to ask again for my partners toast and alas no hash browns in the end. We also received our luke warm coffees after we had finished our breakfast. Very disappointed.

We told the lady we weren't up to dining in but would love a take away pizza. Staff were extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Restaurant was packed, had a great atmosphere and the meals looked absolutely amazing. We waited about 20 minutes for our pizza but were more than happy with this as we had to wander to the convenience store anyway. We had a half half pizza and I can whole heartedly say it was the best pizza I have ever eaten. We were sad that we decided to share and didn't order two pizzas. Next time we are in Dunedin I will most definitely be eating here again.

Before the tour started we were able to look through the museum area which was interesting and lots of cool little characters everywhere - sort of reminded me a bit of willy wonka. We were shown all around the factory and received lots of samples. It was a great insight into how the chocolate is made and was great hearing lots of fun facts. For the money I think the tour was most definitely worth it. We unfortunately weren't hungry however I would have loved to try the cafe. Chocolate shop isn't that well priced and is on par with what you would pay in the super market.

We were attracted by the look of the building and the views, but were sat at a table where we couldn't see outside and we couldn't sit outside because it was raining. Meals were pretty ordinary and I was left a little disappointed after reading some great reviews online. We kind of wish we didn't waste our time driving from Dunedin out to Carey Bay.

I had an extremely heavy suitcase which was easy to get to our second story room by ramp access. Would highly recommend.

Service was quick and friendly, drinks were served in a timely manner and we did not have to wait long for our meals. While we waited we had a lovely view of the park and the lake. Was a cold, overcast day but I am glad we sat outside. Meals were absolutely delicious and very well presented. Good quantity for value without going over the top.

Room was small however we did not spend much time in there so it did not bother us. Bed was weirdly high but comfy. We ate at the restaurant downstairs and it was very good. All staff were lovely and helpful. Well priced for what we got. Christchurch was a bit of a let down but lucky we had a nice hotel to come back to of a night time.

That's why it's a 5.Anyway, the food was delicious. At first, I irked at the idea of itlog na maalat (salted egg) pasta but it was so good. Sisig pizza was also delicious. The staff were also very courteous. They always pay attention, I noticed this as they pour water when your glass is already half-empty.The ambiance has this luxurious feel. It's small but luxurious enough for an ig post.One thing that could be improved is the price. Other meal may be worth around 500 pesos. I could already buy a meal like that in high-end hotels. I think Sequioa Hotel is at 3-stars hotel rating. Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience here at Ombu.

The pool was mediocre. It's small and can get crowded easily since people would go here instead of the pricey attractions.Reading the other reviews, it's true that the security here is close to non-existence. I lost my cellphone here. There was no CCTV anywhere. That's why when I asked for help, they couldn't help me about my situation. This is alarming knowing that anyone can go inside the resort. They only requested our identities when we checked-in at the hotel, but other than that we freely got inside the vicinity of Caliraya. The hotel is atop the place. The area where I lost my phone is nearest attraction in the main entrance of the resort.Though I must say I enjoyed the feeling that I'm close to nature. Trees and green grass are everywhere. There are goats roaming freely. But then again, it could've been better. There are a lot of spaces that would be good if decorated by gardeners or landscapers. The room was very outdated. The aircon works just fine. The beds are okay. The toilets can get easily clogged. We didn't have a problem falling asleep, but then again it's just mediocre. Very basic.Also, don't go here if you dont like walking. SInce the area is huge and uneven, you will have to do a lot of walking and climbing stairs.You have to pay for 100 pesos if you want to have internet access. Not worth it since internet access is only available at the hotel lobby. No internet access in the rooms.Food was basic too. It's actually convenient that for hotel guests our breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet with overflowing coffee and juice were already included. But the food itself was just okay. Even I can cook better.

The room also have a dining area, fridge, and kitchen sink. Even the balcony is spacious.The food was just okay. Not bad. Also, the staff here needs training. When I asked what time can we start swimming in the morning, one staff said 7am and the other staff said 8am. The waiter during our breakfast is also a bit lazy. He just told us to pass the plates instead of putting it in front of the person who ordered the food.The hotel was clean. But the public restroom needs a lot of improvement.Pool is clean too, but can get crowded at times.

The view, marvelous. Food needs a lot of improvement. It has small serving and also a very limited menu to choose from. Also, customer service must improve. I would like to commend how the staff ask us "is there anything we can help you with" from time to time, but there are certain services that doesn't need to be told or asked first. They lack initiative. We held a corporate event at the dome area and they already took out the food around 9:30 pm when our reservation is until 10 pm. No one served water all throughout the event. During our breakfast, they served baked fish which is hot on theWhen we confronted them about their service, the staff acknowledged their shortcomings. But I hope that aside from acknowledging it, they would really do something because their customer service really needs a drastic improvement. It such a waste because the place is really beyond beautiful.

The best part was the entrance where the tallest indoor waterfall welcomes you. There's a trail you could walk on if you want to get nearer the highest part of the waterfall.Bring shawl or other clothing to keep you warm as it can get cold inside since the greenhouse's temperature is controlled. You may get a little wet (just a drizzle) when you get really near to the waterfall.Cons: the view is marvelous but there's nothing much to do. It's like an environmental museum plus greenhouse in one. However, our family enjoyed this better than Universal Studios Singapore. :)

I recommend this to tourists who are looking for something extra to do, maybe those who have free money or time in their itinerary. It was scary at first but after about 2 mins it's not scary anymore. The view above is marvelous. You'll see how beautiful and clean Singapore really is.TIP: The ride regularly cost around SGD 30, but wait til 6pm and their rates go down to SGD 18. Singapore sky is still bright at 6pm (and usually get dark only around 7:30pm) so at 6pm you can still see the top view of Singapore.

Budget hotel that doesn't feel like a budget hotel.”|review_465198758|The staff were accommodating. Everyone of them! The rooms are small but spacious enough for packing and de-packing. It is very clean too! My family and I slept very soundly. One pillow per person but it's very conducive for sleep. We also enjoyed the radio on Channel 18 in the TV. They play nice songs. Considering the low price of the hotel, we were surprised that it had the basic amenities. It felt like a 3 to 4-star hotel. We have the toiletries, hair dryer, slippers, hot and cold bath, tv, en-suite bathroom, mini fridge and electric kettle. They also gave us complementary water bottles, tea bag, and coffee. Also, you could leave your luggage after check out. The environment around the hotel is also peaceful. There's a lot of restaurant in the vicinity. Also, there's a 7-eleven that's only one minute walk from the hotel.Downside: toilet don't have bidet. No free breakfast. No lounge area for guests who checked out already (but they have seats in the lobby). The hotel is a little far from some tourist attraction. But it's fine since Singapore has a very convenient transportation system. We used public transportation and we didn't have any problems. Actually that's it, other than those, everything is perfect. Considering the hotel rates, our stay here is already a steal!!Overall our family really enjoyed our 3 days stay. If we go back to Singapore, we'll stay at Venue Hotel the Lily again. <3
earth05|363F59FC49AC14489C875A55928EEA48|Hotel|Paranaque: Nobu Hotel Manila|5| “Amazing stay!”|review_478830544|The service and comfort I experienced during my stay at Nobu was excellent. Even before my stay, I corresponded with the hotel's GM, Marlon, to request for a room type that's most suitable for me. His response was unexpectedly immediate, and he made sure that my stay was as comfortable as it can be. As a guest, I felt the hospitality and quality of service that Nobu had to offer as a five-star hotel. During my stay, Marlon even contacted me thru the in-room phone to make sure that I was having a wonderful time at Nobu. A hotel staff brought a tea set to my room as a welcome gift, and they also promptly accomplished my requests (e.g. more pillow, replenish toiletries, etc). I especially loved the complimentary bowl of fruits that welcomed me as I entered my room. These small but meaningful gestures truly make Nobu stand out from other hotels, even when compared to fellow five-star hotels. I look forward to staying at Nobu again later this year for my birthday staycation.

Every segment and corner of the temples were intricately adorned with decorations, most of which were gold. We visited just a few days ago, and apparently the mourning period for the recently-deceased king, King Bhumibol--who was the world's longest monarch, is one year. There were mourners dressed in all-black who came to pay their respects to the king. The crowds were huge, but the tour of the palace was still enjoyable. The intense heat, though, became difficult to overcome. Regardless, my first visit to the Grand Palace was indeed a memorable one.
earth05|363F59FC49AC14489C875A55928EEA48|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|5| “Amazing day!”|review_465573206|It was my second time at Universal Studios Singapore. The place hadn't changed much, but my experience was still so great and memorable. There were various activities available for any age group, but the Waterworld show is not to miss. My friends and I also enjoyed Transformers: The Ride. The street shows were also entertaining as you get to meet different characters from the different segments of the park. I specifically liked Charlie Chaplin just walking around New York along with the park guests. This place is definitely a must-visit when in Singapore. I'd still go back!
earth05|363F59FC49AC14489C875A55928EEA48|Restaurant|Pasay: Buffet 101|4| “Great, but there's still room for improvement”|review_171479786|A day before our planned lunch at Buffet 101, my mom already made a reservation. And the morning before we went to SM Mall of Asia, my mom once again called the restaurant and confirmed our reservation. She told one of the staff that we'll be arriving between 11:30 and 12:00 in the afternoon. To our surprise, we were put in the waiting list instead of the reservation list. One staff even told us that we missed our turn which was scheduled for 11 am so we need to be put last in the list. Apparently, we were supposed to receive a text confirmation of our reservation but we did not. That's why we were included in the waiting list. Clearly, a big misunderstanding was made between my mom and the staff whom she talked with. Fortunately, we were able to sort things out with the manager of the restaurant who was present when we were questioning their reservation method. The manager realized that the fault was on their part so he humbly let us in. The ambiance in the restaurant is great. The decorations, fixtures, and furnitures looked like they were part of the hotel. All the food were merged in a long and spacious hall to make it easier for guests to get whatever they want. With regards to the taste and genres of food offered, Buffet 101 has made excellent efforts to provide good quality cuisines from different nations. They have Japanese, Filipino, Italian, Chinese, American, and other food genres that I may have failed to notice. The taste of the food is much better compared to other buffet restaurants. Despite the good food and ambiance, I think the restaurant should improve in their reservation strategy so that no other guest will have to go through what we experienced. To end my review, let me share a few tips and must-trys that you may find useful in your visit to Buffet 101:1. Know what's "heavy" and what's not. The goal of eating in a buffet is to taste as much as what is available for you to eat. Do not waste your stomach space in food that you know will make you easily full (e.g. rice, more than 1 serving of noodles).2. Don't eat what you can always have. If you always eat Pork Adobo (a famous Filipino dish), then why still eat it at the buffet? Sure, a very little serving (just to taste its difference from the other Adobos you have tasted) is fine. But if you will get a large portion of what you can always eat outside the buffet, then you might as well not have bothered splurging for your buffet experience. When eating in a buffet, try eating food that you don't usually encounter. There's no need to fear that you might not be able to finish it if you dislike it since buffet servings are very small. And who knows? You might even discover some new food favorites!3. If it's your birthday, then your meal is free! If you pay cash, you get a 5% discount! And don't worry for possible hidden charges or value added tax, because there's none of that in Buffet 101.4. Know the reservation procedure. When you reserve a seat in the restaurant, be aware that you MUST receive a text confirmation before your scheduled slot at the restaurant. If you don't then don't hesitate to contact them to follow up on your text confirmation.MUST TRYs a. Seafood chowder-very,very tasty. Prepare your stomach though. It comes in a big serving.b. Ebi (Shrimp) Tempura- Tastes good! Not too oily. c. US Angus beef slab something- WOW. The meat is so tender. And the gravy really complements the beef. This is so good!d. Sweet cashews with Sesame seeds- Simple, sweet taste but addicting flavor. Plus, it's nowhere near a heavy snack so you can eat whatever amount you want.e. Beef with eggplant- Unexpectedly good. If you look at it, you might not want to taste it, but when you do, you'll realize that it's really delicious.f. Grilled squids- Oh man. These were great. They were flavorful and yummy!g. Strawberry cheesecake- perfect taste of sweet and tangy!That's it.Enjooy!

The staff were also very accomodating; however, what I did not like were the food choices in the buffet. I think the food didn't taste excellent, most especially the desserts. For a buffet restaurant with that price, the food choices were very little. I did not even see an authentic Japanese dessert in there.
earth05|363F59FC49AC14489C875A55928EEA48|Attractions|Vigan: Calle Crisologo|5| “Vintage!”|review_171340862|If you think about it, Calle Crisologo is just a street; however, it becomes a different story when you actually see the place with your very own eyesn. Probably the most beautiful Calle I have ever seen in my life so far, Calle Crisologo boasts of its beautifully architectured pathway and century-old houses that were now transformed into souvenir shops. Instead of cars, horse-drawn carriages (locally called "Kalesa") are the primary transportation in this street. At night, Calle Crisologo transforms into a very romantic scenery. It gives visitors a feel of the Philippines set in the 1800s. Plus, it's a long street, so you really get to enjoy every bit of it. If you're planning to visit Calle Crisologo, here are some tips that you may find useful:1. Visit the place at night or at dusk. With the yellow lights brightening up the streets, the Calle becomes even more beautiful and romantic. Plus, it's not that hot anymore so you get to enjoy walking along the long street.2. Ride a Kalesa. If you plan on going more than a single time at Calle Crisologo, then try riding a Kalesa (horse-drawn vehicle) even once. You will get to really feel the 19th century aura of the place. Don't forget to document your ride!3. Lots of souvenir shops can be found in the street. All souvenir shops sell almost the same items so don't rush into buying from the first shop you see. Try to visit many shops and compare prices. I think you cannot bargain for lower prices but all the salespeople in the shops are absolutely friendly and helpful. They wouldn't even nag you to buy anything from them. If you don't want to buy anything from a shop, they'll just let you leave without urging you to look at their other products.4. If you have a keen eye, you might even find the museum. The Syquia Museum, home to former Philippine President Elpidio Quirino and wife Dona Alicia Syquia, is not exactly found along Calle Crisologo, but the Calle marks the best way to reach the museum. Only one turn from Calle Crisologo, the Syquia Museum was originally the biggest and richest house in Vigan. Now, as a museum, it features century old ceramics, art, furniture, glassware, and even ceramics that originated from the Ming Dynasty. 5. Immortalize your moments. I think there's no need to remind any tourist to take pictures or videos. But in this case, it is very much encouraged that you document your walk along the street because it's something that you will always want to remember. Believe me, the ambiance in this street is so peaceful and relaxing that you will surely want to reminisce it when you're finally back to your hometown. That's it! Try to experience this yourself. Its really worth the time and effort.
earth05|363F59FC49AC14489C875A55928EEA48|Attractions|Sagada: Sumaguing Cave|5| “Fun and Challenging”|review_151660515|Wow. Sumaguing Cave is a very vast cave found in Sagada, Mountain Province. I think it serves as one of the main tourist attractions of the place. Stepping into Sumaguing cave is a real adventure. We spent more than 3 hours going around the cave. The first phase of the caving experience includes a very steep and narrow path towards the inner part of the cave. This part is surrounded by bat feces in the rocks (and in some situations you have no choice but to hold on to them). The second phase of the cave involves water. Super cold water. You may need to remove your footwear during this part since the pathway will be very slippery. The third phase of the cave is probably the most challenging. We went through very small entry points to reach the next part of the cave. We also "rappelled" inside the cave, in which we landed in the coldest waist-length water I have ever dipped in. We also climbed a stout but challenging mountain of smooth rocks to finally make our way out. It that's not enough, the exit path of the cave is also the entrance, so you will encounter the steep rocks and the bat feces once again. Overall, the experience was very challenging, yet absolutely fun and amazing. This attraction is not for the faint-hearted or the claustrophobic; however, it serves as a good way to see nature in a different way.A word of advice: If you are not experienced with caving, it is not advisable for you to go alone. You must have experienced people (or natives) with you when you enter as Sumaguing cave is not a typical, easy-way-out cave to explore.

Everytime I go back, I see the same attractions over and over again. Fortunately, from my last visit, I saw new rides and attractions. To make my review simpler, I'll just enumerate the positive and negative points of the Park.POSITIVE:1. The entrance fee is relatively cheap compared to other theme parks around the world (About $13).2. The mixture of attractions is fit for adults and children alike. NEGATIVE:1. It' so far from the city. Although there are various ways of reaching the theme park, the travel alone is tiring and very time consuming.2. It's very very small compared to other theme parks around the world.3. It has other attractions which require additional payment. These attractions are not included in the Park Day Pass.4. There are only few rides and attractions to see. In a non-crowded day, you can finish all the attractions in less than half a day. 5. It's a little expensive. The souvenir shops have way too few souvenirs.And a few tips if you plan on going to the park:1. Be there before the park opens. If you go there a few hours after opening time, the waiting lines will surely be crowded already.2. Take note of promos, opening times, etc. (You can refer to EK's official site for more details-- www.enchantedkingdom.ph)3. Bring extra clothes and wear comfy clothes.4. Bring a bag that's easy to carry. However, if you get really irritated of carrying your bag throughout your stay at the park, you can always rent lockers. The locker area is found on the right sight of the entrance (near the bumper cars), and each locker costs about $2.5. Be attentive. Take care of your personal belongings. 6. The Rio Grande Rapids is a must-ride. There you have it!

It has many stores for different types of people. The Midtown Wing is home to internationally recognized brands. The Padre Faura Wing has local shops that offer good quality products/services. You can find many specialty restaurants within the mall-- ranging from American, Italian, Persian, Japanese to even Mexican. Usually, many people visit the mall since:1. Its location is very near two schools (University of the Philippines-Manila and St. Paul's College Manila), 2. Around it are lots of hotels where tourists stay.3. It is located in the Pedro Gil area~ a very busy sector of Manila.Visiting the mall for the first time might be tricky. You're lucky if your hotel is near the mall. However, if it's far, don't plan on visiting, especially if you're going to commute. The mall can't be easily seen from the main roads of Manila. You might have to get a cab (which is not recommendable because some cab drivers will just take advantage of you) in order to reach it. In case you plan to visit the mall, here's a guide on what to see per level (around the whole mall): Ground Floor: Department store, lots of Restaurants and Fast food chains, international and local brands/boutiques for men and women, GrocerySecond Floor: Department store, international and local brands/boutiques for men and women, restaurants, Bowling alleyThird Floor: Arcade, Department store, international and local brands/boutiques for kids, Gadgets, Food court, gymFourth Floor: Services [salons, barber shop, etc], bingo station, movie house

It's crazy out there. The walking space is quite narrow and there are people everywhere. Still, it's a good place to buy bargain stuff. You can always ask for a cheaper price for the item you want. If the seller doesn't give it to you for the price you like, just move along. There'll still be plenty of stores that sell the same stuff. The market mainly sells clothes, cellphone cases, watches, and toys. It's definitely a plus to bring water when going there. It can be really exhausting to walk around such a crowded place.
earth05|363F59FC49AC14489C875A55928EEA48|Attractions|Hong Kong: Hong Kong Disneyland|4| “Fun, Fun, Fun!”|review_136736301|Hong Kong Disneyland is clearly the smallest of all the Disneylands scattered around the world. However, its size didn't stop it from being the happiest place on earth. I visited during the weekend, and I must say that there's a lot of people who went to the park as well. Good thing the rides had waiting times to let you know how long you're going to wait for a specific ride. Overall, the experience was great. I think the staff inside the park were very friendly and professional. It was a good value for money.Now, here are some tips that may be useful for you when you plan to visit HK Disneyland: 1. Everything sold inside the park is pricey (even the food and drinks!), so make sure to bring lots of money especially if you're planning to buy many souvenirs from there. 2. Take advantage of the 10% discount for all items in the Emporium, Mainstreet Sweets, and other shops when you purchase products before 11:30 am. 3. Don't miss the parades (yes, there are more than just one~ Flights of Fantasy Parade at 1 pm and Mickey's Waterworks Parade at 4 pm) and the shows (Philharmagic, Golden Mickeys, Festival of the Lion King) because they are really great and entertaining. 4. Upon entering the park, do get a guide map and times guide to help you out around the attractions inside the park. 5. If you have company, you can still take advantage of the single rider's lane, especially in Space Mountain. If you and your company don't mind sitting beside another guest at the roller coaster, you can enter as single riders (there's a separate line for that) and save yourself the burden of waiting around 45 minutes for the ride in the regular line. The single rider lane generally doesn't fill up-- even a single bit!6. If you plan to watch Mickey's Waterworks Parade up front, an umbrella or raincoat will be helpful, because you will definitely be wet afterwards.7. Try to stay until the closing time. As you may know, the park closes with a display of fireworks. Believe me, just imagining it is very very different from actually seeing it.
earth05|363F59FC49AC14489C875A55928EEA48|Hotel|Hong Kong: Regal Kowloon Hotel|4| “Great Experience!”|review_136493472|We booked 2 superior rooms (twin sharing) for a family of four. These Superior Rooms are located in the lower floors and are different from the Regal Club rooms which are located on the upper floors and are a little bit more expensive. To my great surprise and happiness, the concierge upgraded us to Regal Club rooms for free! The rooms were beautiful. They were spacious and modernly designed. The bathroom was great as well, with complete amenities-- a bunch of different sized towels, bathrobe, shampoo, lotion, toothbrush kit, hairdryer, and everything else you can find in a well-appointed bathroom. You have to pay for the mouthwash, though. Although the hotel was nice, there still are other matters that it needs to attend to. First is the compulsory "down payment" of sort that you need to pay before you could check-in to your room. They need this to guarantee that if you consume any item/service not included in your hotel package, you can still pay for it. You will need to surrender USD 125 per room to the concierge before you check-in. If in case you didn't buy anything aside from your hotel package, you will get the exact money you surrendered when you check-out. But if you do, then they'll just deduct the things/services that you bought and give you back the change. I understand that they have to do this. However, the problem with this transaction is that the guests, in this case, we, were not informed of any "down payment". We were quite surprised that we have to surrender 300 bucks. I am sure that the other guests were quite shocked as well. Second, the lobby contained only 2 single seats. I don't really know why they wouldn't put any more seats. It's funny, really. But if your legs just need to relax and the two seats are already taken, just go to the second and third floors near the escalators. There you'll find sofas that would make your tired legs happy. Overall, this hotel was great. I don't know about the other people who said the concierge were disappointing, but during my stay, they were totally not. I guess we were just lucky. Regal Kowloon Hotel is conveniently located in East Tsim Sha Tsui, with many shops and food chains nearby.

With kids this young, the double stroller really came in handy and fit them nicely. Love to see the older brother holding on to his kid brother and watching the sights around them.Signed up for a 6 month season pass as well which we thought was well worth it at 98 dollars each for adult given that my children have free admission.We went on a weekday and had the opportunity to try out 6-7 attractions. Definitely the experience on a weekday is much better with thinner crowds- you spend much less time queuing for food and rides.Highlight for my kids was the close up photo with Elmo and friends. They absolutely love it!

My elder boy at 3 yr old felt rather intimidated by the myriad of sea creatures but I believe he will learn to enjoy it when he's older. For the adults, definitely we can see the attraction is of high quality and well designed. We will definitely come again.

I was surprised it could still have records over 3 years ago before the app was up. Recommend people to try it for restaurant bookings.Line staff was professional and gave a call a day before my reservation to confirm- and also to inform the much beloved oysters is currently unavailable. Though disappointed, we decided to proceed nonetheless.On the day itself, was a busy Friday night and we wished the staff was more attentive to our needs. That can be forgiven given the splendid spread. Great quality buffet fare, definitely there's something for everyone to enjoy!We absolutely love the lobsters at the prawn mee station and the fresh snow crab legs. A must try!

Especially for kids in my opinion.
Gary H|4AF61F4D9847CA3BC90701C5C4C99738|Hotel|Lagoi: Club Med Bintan Island|4| “1st Club Med experience with young kids”|review_442563216|We have 2 young boys aged 3yrs and 9 months. It's difficult to find a good holiday destination given the constant attention our kids need and the frequent stops we need to take for naps and snacks for the kids.This propelled us to try out Club Med for the first time to experience if this is suitable for us.Truly, the major plus of Club Med is that toddlers are well taken care of in Petit Club. Our boy truly enjoyed his time there with the GOs and kept asking for more. We even made use of the babysitter arrangement to have 1-2 hours of couple time to enjoy our dinner in peace while our boys were asleep.I also had time to try sailing for the 1st time with a GO and this is also a major plus for Club Med if you enjoy sports.Not forgetting the flying trapeze too! It's been 10years since I last touched this. Photo attached. Definitely gave me a shot of adrenalin rush.What could be improved:Dinner buffet is most often the best meal but we feel breakfast can be further improved.We were the first group of guests in the resort as it reopened post 1st phase of renovation. Facilities definitely need to be improved after nearly 2 decades and believe Club Med is working hard on this.

It would have been worse if not for the attentiveness and friendliness of some of the staff.

POLW is a nicely designed, compact water theme park attraction suitable for toddlers under parent supervision.However I feel that with older kids, they might feel they need a bigger place to roam about and explore.Nevertheless we are impressed with POLW- we saw 2 children's party held at the venue while we were there. Definitely this will be on our list when we are considering a birthday party for our little ones next time.

Both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome were memorable and definitely worth a visit.Being Singaporeans, we are proud to have this unique Gardens which showcase the best of technology to incorporate cloud forest settings into the Garden. Truly impressive.There were still some areas of the Gardens in which we did not have time to explore like the Children's Garden which we certainly would like to spend some time there with our toddler next time.

I would think Banyan really pays a lot of attention to what customers say and tries to enhance the overall experience based on the feedback received and this would not just be limited to Bintan- I have the comfort that my feedback will be taken seriously and communicated across with my preferences recorded- such is truly a world class brand.Good words aside, I think some of the facilities in Bintan resort is deemed for an upgrade as we can detect the age of some of the wooden furniture. Cheers and I feel Banyan Tree would be worth a stay in every part of the world with the huge heritage it imparts in the villa resort settings.

The resort may not be as new but it is certainly well-maintained.Breakfast buffet was really something we look forward to as there's a wide selection of juices, smoothies as well as ala carte dishes you can order from.Staff are very friendly and always make sure your needs are well taken care of- we arrived early at 11am but they allowed us to use a waiting room while they are getting our villa ready for check-in.Nice beachfront property- it was windy with light showers during our stay and so we did not use the pool. Having said that, especially enjoyed listening to the waves and coconut tree leaves shuffling in the wind.SALA will be a brand we will remember for the exceptional service quality.

We hired a paddle board from Dukes and gave that a whirl. There was even some turtles swimming next to us when we went out a little further so that was super awesome! Water is so warm and clean. Quite a few rocks underwater so tread carefully otherwise you could injure yourself with an unexpected graze. Definitely worth the visit!

I was lucky enough to have the last available slow roasted prime rib and my family sat in complete envy the whole meal! I am not a huge Steak person but their Steak was absolutely mouth watering! We had a quick drink at the bar beforehand- I recommend their cocktails too and the bar was super busy with a great vibe. Service was exceptional and overall a great dinner.

We had a shuttle pick us up from our hotel and also return us (and all our shopping bags) again in the afternoon. Kate Spade sales were absolutely amazing some other favourites included Ralph Polo, Calvin Klein and Michael Kors. Definitely worth spending a few hours here if shopping is your thing! They also have food trucks in the car park (tacos were yummy!). We were a little disappointed with Adidas and would have been great if a Nike was there too..

We were recommended this place by some colleagues and were so delighted with their suggestion. Menu was upbeat with delicious flavours, fish taco was soooo good, as was the chicken and the classic chips with dip to start! We had the rosè sangria (wish it was bigger than what it was) but again very delicious. Wait staff were really helpful and our waitress took the time to sit down with us and run through some suggestions for our meal which we appreciated. Great night, great vibe and definitely recommend.

It's simple to use and understand their map, the trains are regular and well planned with stations under key locations in the city. If you need assistance or change the staff behind the counter are happy to help, but we managed just fine figuring it out ourselves. Their paper tickets are also reusable which I think is great- they even offer a discount for re-use!

We sent an email request for a booking and were responded to straight away with date options for the AM or PM visit. We went with the morning, we're picked up from our hotel and taken into the National Park where the sanctuary is located. All the staff were extremely friendly with a great sense of humour. You get to interact with the elephants by preparing their food, feeding them, mud bath, wash them off and of course a million photo ops in between. There is a photographer as well who takes pics throughout the visit and adds them to FB for you to save later too! We finished off with a yummy lunch and a take home top! This half-day experience is worth every penny that goes towards the care and support for recovery of these beautiful creatures! Plus who wouldn't want to play with baby elephants !

While the food was lovely and the service was impeccable, I would suggest making a booking before sun down. The restaurant has a magnificent view but we could only make an 8:30pm booking and it was so dark on the coast as well as in the restaurant. So dark they have little lights for the menus so you can read them.. I think a few more candles on their tables could be beneficial - but I think watching the sun go down here would make the perfect evening. Nevertheless seafood is fresh and our chicken fried rice was also delicious. We had a pleasant meal and would recommend the visit if you don't mind spending a little more than other meals in Phuket. Spring rolls are super delicious too!

You pick your cooking style (sauces / steamed / fried etc.) and then jump out the front to pick out your seafood yourself. The seafood was so fresh and delicious we enjoyed oysters, lobster, crabs and tiger prawns! A little pricey for Phuket but it's nothing compared to home for us so we were happy to pay for the quality that we received. We also sat at a great table outside overlooking the Patong Beach sunset. Bathrooms were super clean and service was great too!

Absolutely amazing when the sun is going down, during the day there's plenty to do too. Hair braiding, massages, water activities like parasailing, jet skis, banana boat etc., henna, plus food and drink pop ups. You can hire a beach umbrella and chairs or just plonk yourself on the beach and enjoy the beautiful beach water!

It's worth the visit at night time, super packed and you will literally get hassled every few metres to go to a show, have drinks at a bar or visit a nightclub. But once you get into the swing of it, you get used to it. The vibe is great though and there was a man doing magic tricks and we stopped and watched him for ages = mind blowing! Don't recommend taking kids anywhere near here though but great for couples or adults!

Maybe at night time it is more impressive.

The entrance would not suggest that inside there is such a beautiful place. I loved the way that the menu is presented, is like reading a book. The decoration is beautiful and the service terrific with very good control of the English language. The food was delicious and very nicely presented. We had the caviar, fish tartar, beef stroganoff and some sort of Russian dumplings. Everything was lovely. Probably if you compare it with Russian local prices it will be expensive, but I did not think that this was an expensive meal. Will go back any time.

Very well executed tour. We were picked up at 6am at the hotel and were back in Vegas around 4:30pm which gave us sufficient time to do something else in Vegas. Due to the fact that we had the helicopter and boat ride booked, our time at the Grand Canyon was shorter than the time our travel companions had. Still, we thought that there was more than enough time to admire the Grand Canyon and to take plenty pictures.

We went t0 this place recommended by a friends that use to work here. We love French cuisine and it’s difficult in Chile to find a good French restaurant s it is not easy to get the right products. But in this restaurant the food was amazing. We were six at the table and everybody enjoyed their meal. I had the sweetbread as a starter followed by the duck confit. The duck confit was amazing, one of the best I ever had.

The rooms are nice and clean and located in a very nice neighbourhood. Right in front of the Santa Lucia hill. If you have a closer look in the rooms then you can see that they are in need of a makeover, however this did not bother us. The room has a small living room, a kitchen and a bathroom with a bath tub. Internet was fine too. This is not a hotel, hey are more like small apartments in 3 or 4 building complex. The concierge seemed a little bit scruffy and overworked with two guests that arrived at the same time. If you are looking for a cheap accommodation for one r two nights, this is perfectly fine.

I love this city, but you are better off exploring it by food.
Bego75|054CA85D5C59469773EB7F0B07820F1A|Hotel|Santiago: Luciano K Hotel|5| “Amazing”|review_477699044|This is a great hotel in a beautiful neighbourhood; very central and close to a metro station. We were upgraded from a standard room to a deluxe room. The rooms are big for Chilean standards and the bathroom was huge. The hotel is in an antique building with a very old elevator which gives the hotel old movie flair. We did not use the pool; however when we had a look and it seem to us that it was quite small. Sift drinks and water are in the room free of charge. The staff in this hotel is one of the best that we have ever encountered, always friendly and helpful. They sure know how to go the extra mile. For example one day when we came back to the hotel we asked the receptionist if we could have an iron and he said he would send it up to our room. It took us two minutes to take the elevator and go up to our room and the maid was already waiting in front of our room with the iron board. We were impressed. We only had one mishap/miscommunication with the gentlemen that checked us in on the first day. He informed us that breakfast was included in our room which I thought was odd as nothing was mentioned in my reservation and I had not booked the breakfast. My mistake was I did not ask further and thought this is maybe a perk that comes with the upgrade. When we did our checkout, the same gentleman stated that we had to pay the breakfast as it was not included in our room. When we reminded him that he was the one that told us 2 days ago that breakfast was included, he confessed this was a mistake on his side and we had to pay 10$ per person per day. This is a pity as since I’m not a breakfast person; my breakfast consists in one coffee and one croissant. Nevertheless, if you like breakfast they do offer a small but well equipped buffet and you can order a la minute made eggs or omelettes. All in all we had a fantastic stay at this establishment and I would stay here any time again.

The staff is very friendly and helpful. However, the difference between a 5 star hotel and this establishment are the little details. We had two rooms and when we arrived I asked if one of them had twin beds as noted in my reservation, I was ensured several times that this was the case, however when we arrived to the room there were no twin beds. I had to go back to the reception and ask again for the twin beds. Later that evening I had a message in my room from the reception desk for Mrs. Smith, letting me know that I had left behind my reading glasses and something else in the tour operator’s car and I could pick it up at the reception desk. This is very nice, the only problem I am not Mrs. Smith. The next day in the evening I had another message that we could not quite understand, but we could tell that it was not for us either. I went to the reception desk and they were also not sure what the message was about and for whom it was. These little mishaps did not really bother me or spoiled my vacation in any way, however it is the little details that make the difference between 4 and 5 stars. In any case, wew loved our stay here and we can recommend it 100%.

If you are going with smaller children perhaps it is more fun. But we were four adults (our children are 18 and 20). There are maybe 5 or 6 rides that were exciting, but the rest is quite lame. I also found the park to be very small. We have near my home (in Germany) an amusement park that is probably 3 to 4 times bigger, with 11 roller-coaster, plus several other attractions. Being this in Singapore and for that price I don't think it was worth the money. In our opinion the good rides were, gallactica, transformers the ride, the mummy, jurassic park rapids and the Shrek 4D movie is OK but we have seen better ones.

The room is not the biggest but is OK. I absolutely loved the bathroom. It is very big with a bathtub and a rain shower. The pool is gorgeous with a very handy pool bar. This place is fine for a couple of nights, however forfor more days I would book something closer to the beach or so. The reason why I gave 4 stars is because when you look closely the room could use some repair. Nevertheless the place is great with an unbeatable price.

They really know how to treat customers. We chose the chef’s menu were you don’t know what is coming. With every dish the waitress would come and explain what she was serving and how you should eat it in order to enhance the flavors to a maximum. 100% recommended.

The hotel is very nice and could not be in a better location. You are right in the center of Lisbon and close to everything. The staff is terrific, very accommodating and helpful. However, the rooms at this hotel are very small, even for European standards. We were two adults with two suitcase and two carry-ons and there was hardly any space in the room. There is no closet as such, basically there is a whole in the wall with a few shelves. The bathroom is OK, but again. As soon that you open the door to the bathroom it became very small. I really liked every else about this place, but just because of the size of the rooms I would not stay here again.

However, last Saturday we decided to have a last drink here before going home. It took them over 20 minutes to acknowledge us and finally when the girl to the order it took about another 30 minutes for the drinks to come to the table. Probably our own fault for not leaving when we were not served in the first place. The drinks were good, but not worth the wait.

We ordered the octopus Galician style and the fish croquettes and both were absolute horrible. The octopus was so small that you could hardly see it and there were mainly potatoes and no octopus on the plate. Also, so it happens, we are from the region were octopus Galician style comes from and I can tell you this dish was not even close. The croquettes were reheated and simply tasteless. The place was full mainly with tourist as it has a fantastic location. However, in a great city like Basel and it the old city you will be able to find much better restaurants and with more reasonable prices. For two very small tapas and four beers we paid 50 Swiss francs. I know Basel is an expensive city and I’m very familiar with prices in Switzerland, but even for Swiss conditions these prices are outrageous.

Even the stage is quite petite. It was full of tourists, but I believe that every Tango show in Buenos Aires is mainly made for tourists. None of my Argentinian friends have ever been to a Tango show in their life’s. They have 8 very good dancers, one singer who sang two songs as he was a bit sick on that night and one group that plays traditional Andean music (must say they were spectacular). We did not have the dinner, so I cannot comment on that. Two drinks were included in our package. They give you to choose from champagne, wine and beer. They don’t serve you premium brands, but it was OK. The service was very attentive and nice and yes, at the end of the show she is asking for tips. Although I did not perceived it in a bad way as all she did was explain to us that service is not included in case we want to leave something. She was not rude in anyway and it is no different than in any other restaurant around the world. We had a great evening with an excellent show.

The specialty of the house is the fondue, however since I live in Switzerland I chose not to have fondue in Argentina. We ordered as a starter fried calamari. They were a bit hard but OK. Then, as I main course, me and my friend decided to go with the Lam. It was advertised on the menu as “grilled rack of lamb with rustic potatoes and green beans”. What we got was rack of lamb, with some sort of very sweet red wine reduction sauce and potatoes. The green beans were nowhere to be found. The rack of lamb was full of fat, but it didn’t matter because the sauce was so sweet that we were not able to eat our lamb. On top of this, the service was quite slow. It took 15 minutes to get three Caipirinhas. But the worst was that suddenly one cockroach start walking across out table. We mentioned this to our Waiter who wiped the cockroach away with a napkin. Soon after another cockroach crossed our table. Needleless to say that with the cockroaches on our table and the very sweet sauce (that we did not order), our appetite was gone and we left the building very disappointed.

The caipirinhas were terrific but this was about it, the rest of the food is just average. We had as a starter the provoleta cheese and the ceviche sake, which both were quite good. As a main course I had the green seafood Thai curry which tasted nothing like curry. The green curry was bland, very boring. The rice was hard and the seafood looked like frozen mix seafood out of one of this bags that you can get in the frozen section in any supermarket. Not the kind of seafood I was expected in Buzios. But the worst part was the service. We arrived at the restaurant shortly after 7pm and it took nearly 20 minutes for somebody to come and take our order. While taking our order, we explain to the Waitress that we are in a rush as we had to be somewhere else at 9:30pm. The appetizers came very quick which made us believe that she understood that we were in a hurry. We were wrong. Our main course was served at 9pm!! Despite the fact that we asked at least three time for our entrees, it took nearly 2 hours for our main course to be served. We had to swallow down our meal in 15 minutes. I will probably never go back to this place. If you are worry about the view, there is plenty restaurants on the same street with exact the identical view.

It is a fantastic place to enjoy a day with the family. In fact, I believe that today one day is not enough to enjoy the park as there is so much to do and see. They have plenty rides for younger kids and then they have the most exciting rides for older kids and adults (13 different roller coasters). I believe there is something for everyone here. Even if you go with elderly people, you can just walk around the park and take one of the slower rides on the water. In my opinion everything is beautifully done. I do not understand the comments about having to stand in line for one or two hours. Let me tell you that I have been to this park in any season of the year, with rain and sunshine and there were times we waited hours to get on the better rides and there were days (due to the weather conditions) that nobody was in the park and therefore no lines. If you chose to go to Europa-Park on a Sunday, in summer, during school Holidays, Christmas or Halloween, you are most luckily to encounter long lines. Try to go on a week day when it is raining. I guarantee you the park will be much less crowded. The entrance fee is about 40 euros but then all the rides and shows inside are free. In my opinion this is not a bad deal. The food is overpriced amusement park food. I have never been to any amusement park, Water Park, or any kind of park where the food was cheap and good. However, you have the option to bring your own food. We have often taken our own sandwiches and drinks that we have purchased in a supermarket at home. Certainly a much cheaper option. I would recommend this park to anyone at any time as it is a great way to spend the day, in fact, I’m already planning my next trip there.

After doing a search on the Internet we found Ca’Macana. They have a very nice catalogue online with all kind of nice masks in all different price ranges. Each one of us chose their mask and they arrived about one month later. They were just beautiful! My brother in law, who is very talented, did some nice costumes for us and off we went to the carnival. I must say I loved my mask with my costume and had a great experience at the carnival. I would recommend this place anytime if you are looking for a beautiful handmade mask in order to enjoy the Venice carnival in a different way.

So off we went and joined this tour. And we are glad we did. Unfortunately I cannot remember the name of our guide, but her English was excellent and she had a good sense of humor.

However, I was disappointed on my shrimp fajitas. The shrimp were so small that you could hardly see them and there were only a few of them on the plate. Usually shrimp fajitas are served stir fried with veggies. Since I don’t eat onions I asked them to please cook them without onions. When my plate came, I could see there were still some onions on the plate what makes me think that they forgot about it, served the plate and then remember that I ordered without onions and took as many onions out they could. But no other veggies (usually peppers) were served with the shrimp. Also, I ordered an order re-fried beans to be served with my fajitas and they were served much later. The idea was to eat them together with the fajitas. It seemed to me that the waiters were overloaded with work. We had to wait quite a long time for our drinks or for special orders.

They have a great selections of beers. Zoran, the owner, is a great bartender super professional and makes the best cocktails in Basel. We were all so happy, we can’t wait to visit again. They also function as a sports game when any important game is on. Perfect place for a great night with friends. I guarantee you that once you come here for the first time you will become a regular. They just make you feel welcome.

We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table for 6. I did not think it is expensive. We had a lot of food and paid an average of 28$ per person. Of course if you compare this with Shanghai’s street prices it is expensive. But, although I love eating at local cheap places in Shanghai my friends do not, so this is a perfectly fine restaurant. Nevertheless I have to say the restaurant was much better looking in Honk Kong. The one in Shanghai does look like a fast food restaurant.

Service was very attentive and polite. We ordered 5 appetizers to share so we could all try them. They were good but to be honest nothing to rave about. We also ordered the artisanal bread which was outstanding, to die for. After that we all ordered our main course. I had the pasta with the vongole and I have to say this was one of the worst pastas I ever had. The pasta was all stick together and looked like a sort of ball on my plate soaked in the white wine sauce; you could actually lift the whole pasta ball just with your fork. The vongole were tasty but were also stick to the shells which made it quite difficult to separate the meat from the shell. I’m guessing here they were overcooked. The pasta had no taste what so ever, completely insipid, I think there was not even salt on this pasta. My colleague had the aubergine parmigiana which came with garlic bread. We asked the waiter if we could have a separate portion of garlic bread, which we were willing to pay for, but apparently this was not possible in this establishment. You had to order the whole dish in order to get the garlic bread. I did try the garlic bread on my friend’s plate and let me tell you that this was also the worst garlic bread I ever tasted. It was very insipid as well, I believe they forgot the salt here too, so we were quite happy we did not order extra garlic bread. On the bright side the cocktails and the wine we ordered were very good. Not sure if Jamie Oliver would be proud to put his name on some of this dishes being such a foodie in his show.

As we have been to Hong Kong before we were just planning in going out occasionally and mainly stay in the room and relax. We even ordered two times room service, which was excellent. The rooms are very spacious, modern and clean. The hotel is attached to a big mall, in case you need to do some shopping. There is also a MTR station in the mall and there is another MTR station about 10 minutes’ walk from the hotel. They have a very well equipped gym and a nice pool with a Jacuzzi. The staff is amazing, from the reception to housekeeping and to room service. They would do anything to make their customers happy. Definitely this is a place where I will stay again in Hong Kong.

It is a touristy place, but the food was excellent. We had the famous Fliegmuller Schnitzel. We thought initially that the special is the veal one, but we were informed by our waiter that the special is made out of pork. The potato salad was to die for. Be aware, if you are travelling with kids or teenagers (like we did), this is a place that does only carry original Austrian products. Therefore you will not find here French fries, Coca Cola, ketchup, etc. Our waiter was also excellent and very funny. We had a great time here and I will recommend this place to go once for the experience.

We loved the big shower in the bathroom. The hotel is closed to a metro station that will bring you anywhere in Berlin. They do offer an American style breakfast buffet for 15 euros, however we did think that this is quite expensive. Given that you have three coffee shops right across the street. They serve coffee, bread, butter, jam, croissants, etc. for much less. The Internet was also working in the room flawless. I have to say we enjoyed our stay here very much.

It is nothing fancy and the apartment seems a little bit run down but for what we paid we really cannot complain. We did not think it was difficult to find. You step out of the metro station, go to the right and it is two minutes’ walk. Of course you have to choose the correct exit at the metro station otherwise you will be lost. The main sleeping room has a big bed that is quite low and it looked at first very uncomfortable. However it was OK. You have a kitchen that we did not use and it was equipped with the essentials. Nevertheless it had two cups, two glasses….but we were four. It didn’t matter as we only used this place to sleep, but attention to detail. The bathroom is fairly big and it has a wash machine you can use, however you need to buy the soap. All in all the place was OK, the neighborhood was fine, the metro station is close by and takes you everywhere in Budapest, however in a cheap city like Budapest I’m sure there is better accommodations and not much more expensive.

I specially enjoyed that it is not the typical audio commentary "now look to the left, now look to the right ". It is like the Danube would tell you the history of Budapest. We were lucky as it was a beautiful evening and you also have a drink included in the price. The staff is terrific and very helpful.

There are several small pools where you can relax and three outside pools. We enjoyed all of them and had a few relaxing hours. They also have a few saunas that you can use. The building is beautiful but could use some makeover. This is nice to do in Budapest but is not the best thermal bath I habe been to. They have also a spa, but since we did not use it I cannot comment on it.

The rooms are not bad and clean. I thought the room for four was quite small but Ok. There is a kitchen were you can cook your own meals, but the supermarket next door does not really carry many items (not the hotel's fault). The staff on the other hand seamed bothered every time we aproached them. We booked a room for four, two single beds and two bunk beds. When we arrived the top bunk bed was not made. But we had sheets in order to make it ourselves. The next day, again there beds were made except for the top bunk. When I pointed out to the lady at the reception desk that our fourth bed was not made, we were informed that they don't make the top bunk (???). I explain to the young lady that I was just in salzburg in the same hotel and all beds were made at all times. The answer was that they make thinks differently in Vienna (???). I understand that certain hostels have rules like you have to rent towels, rent sheets or that you have to make your own bed. Nevertheless, I did never experience that they would make three beds and not the fourth one. I still don't know the reason for that. Funny enough our last day the whole room was not made. We didn't ask the reception why, but since it was a Sunday we assumed this was the reason. But we are not sure. Also, the Internet was the worst that we experienced during our Europe trip. It would not work in the room nor in the lobby. The only good think about this place is the location. You are very close to metro number 4 that takes you pretty much everywhere in Vienna.

The staff was very nice and knowledgeable. We booked a family room for four and decided last minute that we needed a room to ourselves. The staff went out of their way to find us a double room to an affordable price. The rooms are spacious and clean. The Internet connection is great too and worked very well everywhere. They have a kitchen where you can cook your own meals. It is very well equipped and we used it quite often to cook our dinners. You have two big supermarkets right next door. There is not much more in the neighborhood but the bus number 4 takes you in 10 minutes into downtown. There were several big groups in the hotel but we did not experience any noise at night. All in all a great stay.

We popped in on a Saturday night with no reservations and of course the place was full. We were offered by the Mexican chef (looked like the owner) to wait at the bar while waiting for a free table. After a few minutes we where shouted at by the German waitress. Basically we were told that we are blocking her way and we could not stay there at the bar (this was the place we were given by the owner). A little bit upset because of her manners we moved to another side of the bar. Then she came back and asked if we wish to eat at the bar which we declined. She informed us that she does not know how long it would take to get a table as she had other people waiting before us (nobody else was waiting in the restaurant besides us). This young waitress really left a bad test in our mounth as she was talking quite rudely to us. We were ready to just walk off. Nevertheless, we finally got our table. The only reason why I gave four stars is because the food was really excellentand we enjoyed it very much. I could see that the waitress was very busy and she was running around like a headless chicken. Therefore I want to believe that she had a bad day and this is not her natural approach to customers.

We have stayed in youth hostels before and usually besides dom beds they have nice family or private rooms. We booked a private room for four and we got for bunk beds. Not really what we were expecting. The mattresses were very uncomfortable, however the room was clean. The bathroom was Ok, but when you took a shower the water would stop running every 30 seconds or so. You have to keep pressing in order to keep the water running. I understand that they probably want to save water, but with the shower and the bunk beds we felt like in the military. The hostel has a bar downstairs that is full of young people, specially on weekends. The staff is very young as well and you are more treated like a college instead of a customer. Nevertheless the hostel has a great location. You are two minutes away from the metro, tram and main train station. And a short walking distance from the Marienplatz.

We had a room for four which was quite big with a big bathroom. The hotel is quite old and in need of a makeover. But for this money in the expensive city of London it is OK. The location is great, next to the Paddington metro station, you can be in 15 minutes anywhere in the center of London. It is also in a good neighborhood, full of pubs, supermarkets and all kinds of restaurants. The problem here are the employees. All of the ones that we encounter have an "I don't case " attitude. They were not rude, they just didn't care. When we arrived I was given a checking card to fill out. At no point I was asked for my passport nor my credit card. I think this to be very odd as anybody could have done the check-in on my behalf. Our room turned out to be very hot, so I went down to the reception and asked the person in charge if there is anything they could do. I was told to come back the next day as he was alone (not really my problem) and there was nothing he could do. The next morning I went down and spoke to a different gentleman. This time I was told to turn the heater down. When I explained this was the first thing we did and perhaps there is another problem, he said well if the heater is down there is nothing he could do "just open the window " (???). At the same time I informed him that our toilet is not flashing properly. At this time he was already looking at me like I was giving him hard time. He said he will send someone but never wrote my room number down. Needless to say the toilet was never fixed during our stay. Breakfast is a different story. The breakfast is not bad. They give you two choices, either continental or English breakfast with coffee, tea and jus. Quite good. But the ladies working there they just don't want to be there. They never smile and if you enter the breakfast room without being called they almost bark at you "wait outside ". Apparently since they have so many guests you are not allowed to enter the room until they call you. Since there is no sign anywhere, nobody knows, and everybody enters the room the first time without being called. I suggest they sound put a sign up. As I said I would not mind staying in this place due to the cheap price, but the staff has a long way to go. By the way, Internet was not working properly in the room, this is the reason why you will see many people with devices in the corridors.

The owner greeted us upon arriva, gave us a map and explained all the essentials about the area and how to get to Venice. After that we saw him once during breakfast and never again as there is no reception desk. If you have any questions there is a phone number you can call. This is fine with us as we generally like to be on our own. The room for four people was quite tiny but clean. The breakfast as mentioned in other comments could use some improvement. Perhaps a toaster in order to toast the bread will be nice. The location of the hostel is great. Right in front of the bus stop and every 15 minutes or so bus number 19 is passing by and takes you quickly into Venice. Same when coming back. There are several buses in Piazzale Roma that take you to the hostel. All in all we had a good stay.

Best decision. Besides Jana is a native from Prague and passionate about her city. We decided to go with her and it was a great tour, as the size of the group was so small there was plenty time for explanations and questions. She tells you a lot about Prague’s history and communist past. Since she is from here it makes the stories more interesting as you get the facts first hand. We liked her tour so much that we came back the next day for the castle tour.

No parking validation but for 2-3 hours you'd pay R15 at the underground parking. There is signage to direct you to the correct exit, but it is a little confusing for a first time visitor.

The hotel is attractive, staff are efficient and offers the bed and pillows good sleep quality. Very large bathroom and a tub big enough for two. Unfortunately at the moment there is construction next door, so if you have any intentions of sleeping in, then perhaps choose a different hotel for now. The noise starts shortly after 7 however as I was already up for my work day, it didn't affect me to much. The breakfast was excellent.

We drove to Private Taxi Transfer point and opted for the premium package including BBQ lunch with drinks, speedboat the waterfall and of course time on the island. I feel that our package was a good deal and we opted for an extra parasailing excursion which was thrilling and very well organized and safe. The views here are what you imagine a Mauritius postcard to look like. The speedboat ride cuts down your travel time, so in my opinion is worth a little extra. The waterfall is not spectacular but we enjoyed the ride and seeing the monkeys was a bonus. The lunch was basic with a combo of chicken and fish or just one if you prefer. The complimentary rum made the remainder of the afternoon very pleasant. The last water taxi back was at 4pm and we couldn't believe how time flew by. Everything else is expensive and extra including beach lounge and drinks on the main island, so take a little picnic bag with you along with beach mats and towels to add to your comfort. Don't forget sun cream.

My wife and I stayed at Surfers Apartments which is just over the road and so this was a convenient spot to enjoy cocktail sundowners and dinner. The menu is varied and we opted for pizza and pasta and we enjoyed both. The view is the king here though and there is nothing to beat the rhythmic beat of the ocean while enjoying a meal or drinks. You have a choice of sitting on the edge of the beach on the sand or the main restaurant raised on a platform overlooking the beach.

The large apartment has everything you need for a holiday home. A small kitchenette with all the utensils needed to do your own cooking, a comfortable double bed with a large en suite plus a sleeper couch if needed. The view from the balcony was raised and so overlooked the beach trees giving stunning opportunities to see the giant fruit bats (flying foxes) and the little beach in front of the apartments over the main road is a gem on its own. The Surfers Restaurant directly in front of the apartments offers lunch and dinner options with a varied menu and even breakfast on request. Otherwise, there are plenty of supermarkets within 5 minutes drive to stock up on food supplies. My wife and I both felt we could easily return to this beautiful spot. It is situated on the south eastern tip of the island about 20 minutes drive from the airport along the main coastal road. It is definitely away from the main tourist areas which for us is a bonus. The staff are friendly and helpful. Highly recommended and will definitely return.

They really went above and beyond the call of duty. Sadly we didn't get to stay long but the apartment was large and had most amenities to make a stay home away from home. It is situated away from the main tourist beach areas but the win is a more reasonable room rate and a 5 minute taxi ride takes you to one of the main beaches. The hotel arranged a transfer service to and from the airport at a cost of €25 each way.

Patricia, the owner, greeted us on arrival and made sure we were looked after. The beach is just steps away and the soft splash of the ocean adds even more of a romantic atmosphere. The service was attentive and although not everything was available on the menu, alternatives were suggested. For starters I had Grilled Camembert, mains Prawn & Chicken curry and creme brûlée for dessert, all of which was excellent. A live duo played music which was just the right volume not to intrude on conversation, but certainly added to the already romantic atmosphere. The prices match a fine dining experience so this should be considered a special night out rather than just casual fare, but you get what you pay for. Will recommend and will be back.

I have over 400 plus reviews and have travelled extensively and every once of my being says AVOID this operator at all costs. First we tried to book online and sent an email which was never answered. We persevered as a family member had recommended them. We finally went to their office near Sunset Boulevard midweek and made a booking in person. The sales pitch was quite strong leaning on them claiming their boat offers fewer numbers and better customer service than their competitors. Despite being about €10 more expensive than other operators we had seen, we opted to confirm the booking. It was explained to us that this was low season and as such they were only sailing on the Friday - the last day of our week long vacation. We gave our names and a contact telephone number as required. On Friday morning we arrived at the meeting point on time to find the office was closed and remained so for the next 20 minutes. Eventually a man in a car pulled up outside and shouted to us that the boat trip was cancelled and sped off before we could engage. We waited for another 10 minutes hoping someone could assist us but eventually gave up and left. We drove the coastal road looking for other operators but pardon the pun, we had missed the boat and clearly placed our faith in the wrong operator. I am sure, as previous reviews suggest, when they do run the service they may well give a great experience but they way in which our booking was handled and then the way we were informed about the cancellation was unprofessional and rude. I would therefore NOT recommend this operator in anyway. This completely spoiled our final day and with no recourse, apology, alternate plan or suggestion or even a decent explanation other than a man shouting at us from a car - leaves a very bitter taste in ones mouth.

There has recently been a change of ownership and the center is clean, friendly and reasonably priced. What I liked : new equipment, efficient and friendly staff, choice of dive sites, flexibility, extra option to have a meal after dives, clean HQ, thorough dive briefings.What I didn't like : crew smoking on the boat, inconsistency of service - on first day's dive we had juice and biscuits on the boat with juice and coffee on return - second day's dive we didn't. I haven't dived before in Mauritius so perhaps this is how things are here, but having to disassemble, wash and pack away rented equipment myself was unusual. We dived coral gardens and turtle point. Turtle point was true to its name and we had a sighting of 5 turtles.

Several British columns crossed the Natal borders into Zulu territory expecting a swift and decisive victory against the perceived underwhelming half naked Zulu army. The central column camped below the magnificent mountain of Isandlwana after crossing at Rorke's Drift under the leadership of Lord Chelmsford who split his force and went in search of the main Zulu army with most of his men. Those left at camp were slaughtered by the Zulu Army who although were technically ill equipped made up for this in sheer numbers.

The hospital is now a tiny museum and there is a rather ill equipped souvenir shop. I would highly recommend a visit although I would suggest a human guide rather than be led by a guided pamphlet to get a real sense of the story.

It's difficult to put this boutique hotel into any category and rather it shines on its own. It is at heart a boutique hotel, but its soul is an eclectic mix of contemporary and traditional African art without any thought to conventional norm in the display thereof. Every room is its own gallery and the main hall is something to see to believe. You could easily spend hours just wandering the place as every nook and cranny is decorated with African art but there is definitely a Balinese influence too. The Gardens are just as fun to wander and the main pool/patio area has stunning views over the gorge. The rooms are huge and for this stay I booked an executive suite but perhaps this was overkill and if I stay again it will be a smaller room as the bigger room really is excessive with separate lounge, massive patio, kitchenette, hallway and an amazingly large and comfortable bathroom. The manager, Alta was very polite and attentive without being obtrusive and her breakfast was top drawer. As other reviewers have commented, beware the driveway. It is definitely not for the feint hearted. My only criticism (but I haven't marked it down as I knew this beforehand) is that there is no bar or meal service onsite. It would have been nice to enjoy a Gin & Tonic while we enjoyed the sunset, but there is a fridge in the room, so bring your own.

The space is decorated very well and the service was attentive although our table wasn't checked up on by management. The menu is vast and is definitely leaning to an American style of food and description. Most main courses are stand alone and if sides like fries or veggies are wanted, they should be ordered and are charged separately. Most of our table ordered burgers which seemed to average around the R100 with fries. The plates were very nicely presented and food very tasty. We opted to bring our own wine and there was a minimal corkage fee. For dessert we shared waffles and Sundaes which were excellent. There is choice of seating indoors and outdoors, where the latter has gas heaters to keep you warm in a cool winters night. All told, a very pleasant night out and I would definitely visit again.

My first (and probably only) visit wasn't great. My wife and I opted for breakfast. The food was OK but the service wasn't, making the overall experience poor. It started with the waitress (who never introduced herself nor came across as friendly) spilling my wife's coffee into the saucer while serving making the biscuit soggy. There was no apology or offer to refill. The manager (bald guy who talked on the phone while pacing up and down so assumed him to be the manager) looked bored and yawned several times while in front of patrons without regard for trying to cover it up. This feeling of apathy filtered down to the staff as we noticed that it took some time for waiters to clear and wipe tables after patrons had left. The chair at our table was broken showing splinters on the back rest. The walls were littered with chipped paint from chairs being knocked into the wall. Our empty cups were left on the table well into the meal without any offer for another order and at no time did the waitress or manager enquire as to how our experience was, otherwise I may have advised them directly of my experience rather than resorting to a more formal approach on a restaurant review site. I doubt I'll be back as there are just too many options in the area to have to compromise on friendliness and service,

On the night we visited there was an elegantly dressed couple singing lovely music on the outdoor deck which elevates the atmosphere a notch, yet the screams from the mini soccer field next door lower it again. So all that aside - the food and service was good. I had the lamb chops and short rib - sadly there was no rump steak the night we visited. My one negative is that the plates are placed on the tables cold and you dish your meat from a communal platter. On a winter's night especially, the plates should be warmed. Like the name says - it's a braai lounge although the canteen style furniture doesn't imply a lounge at all. Food is served by platter or by weight if you choose to make your own platter - you select from the butcher trays, so don't take your vegetarian friends and family. Be careful though as you pay for the fat and bone too, so the price can elevate quickly. The sides are served in small two bowls ideal for sharing. There are some unusual dishes available not often seen on restaurant menus including 'walkies' - chicken feet. I'm not sure whether this is a novelty or if some clients actually order this. Ultimately, I enjoyed my night out as a novelty once off. I probably would return but perhaps not anytime soon, as it feels to close to a home braai experience without the usual accompaniments. However if you feel like a braai without having to clean up afterwards, then definitely try it.
NauticalVoyager|FD8A71B0837BDA49C26F9B8E693ABB36|Restaurant|Hillcrest: The Kitchen|3| “Wobbly start”|review_488481250|Was recommend to me and as I was eager to give it a go so as a first visit started with breakfast for myself and family. Great views, nice layout and friendly staff. My wife made it very clear to the waitron that her breakfast should not include any tomato as she is allergic. When the breakfast arrived for my wife, there was a slice of grilled tomato on the plate. I informed the manager who played the blame game on the chef. Thus a wobbly start to the meal, but other than that it was nice - not a WOW experience but certainly a place I'd like to try for a different meal and give it another go.

Tickets were a little expensive but worth it! It included canapés before the movie that were delicious and was buffet style. We were in cinema 1 and the seats were beds! Including a free mini bar, blankets and slippers. And if you needed anything else you just called a waiter over to assist you. Luxury cinemas at its best! Would definitely come back again!

Best to go when it opens and go to the most popular rides first. You can buy an express pass that lets you go to the front of the queue on most rides once. We purchased this but didn't use it until later in the day when more people were at the park and the wait times were 45 minutes plus - wired a treat because you actually do skip the queue to the front. Food as expected was delicious but overpriced, drinks the same. We were going to get public transport there but found it easier to get a taxi. Going home we rode in the cable car over the water from Sentosa. Great day out for everyone!

Room comes with free use of a cellphone that you can take with you while exploring the city! Was such an awesome tool to have with us as it was able to help us book tours and tickets, use google maps and give us discounts. Plus you could make free local and International calls - which was great to phone home with.There is an on-site pool, spa and gym (which we didn't use but look great). If you are leaving early in the morning and need a taxi from the hotel, either book one in advance or go to reception early as there was always a line for the taxi's - and the hotel itself isn't really too close to the city, you can be waiting for a while for a taxi to arrive, it took us about 15 minutes to get to the front of the queue.

Is a great hotel central to everything really.Receptionists were amazing and nothing was ever too much trouble for them - hotel services were also quick, cheap and easy (had laundry completed).On arrival received a welcome drink and explanation of the area which was extremely helpful as it was our first time and had no idea what to do and where to go. The initial room was a small room with no windows, we were able to upgrade to a city view room with big windows that opened. Room was very large!Only downside to the hotel was the constant smell of cigarette smoke. There is a window in the bathroom that opens to a little gulley that all the bathrooms lead to, so if someone smokes on L1 out the window it drifts up to all the rooms. We had to sleep with the bathroom door shut and a towel over the window - even doing this, waking up in the morning felt like I had smoked a packet in my sleep! There is a restaurant on the top level that had a nice view while enjoying the buffet breakfast in the morning. Went to the restaurant for lunch but it was over priced. Would stay here again but only a short time as the smoke smell was too much for me.

We didn't book and waited only 10 minutes for a table (2 of us).You could have a better meal pretty much anywhere that would be cheaper and taste just as good.

He was awesome - gave us so many tips on the city, tours we can do and nothing was too much trouble for him. Daily breakfast was awesome, had a great pool, and free use of the push bikes. The hotel itself is not in the old town so you are probably best to take a taxi (or use the bikes).Will stay here again!

Best fish and chips we've had in a long time!Crumbed fish is fantastic, as are the thick crunchy chips, the lovely coleslaw and the potato scallops. Service was great and they are very busy. This is the place the locals recommend.Tip- ring your order up and they will give you a time to come and pick it up. They can get very busy and if it's a cold night, it's better to have a drink in a bar nearby than stand out in the cold. We did this and were told to come at 7pm which we did and it was ready bang on time.Would definitely return when we come back to Hobart.

Offering 3 different 1.5 hour cruises, this is a great way to see some of the Gold Coast.Choose from a Morning Cruise, a lunch cruise or an afternoon cruise. We did the morning cruise which was $20 for adults and $18 for concession. This covers a 1.5 hour cruise, tea and coffee and snacks (biscuits and cake) as well as commentary. The captain and staff are friendly and funny making for a very pleasant cruise. It was pouring with rain during our cruise, but this didn't impact the enjoyment at all. You can sit inside, down the bottom undercover or upstairs if you want to brave the weather. We saw all the beautiful luxury homes, learnt a bit about who owned some of them, saw many beautiful boats and even saw a couple of resident eagles in their nest along the river.Drinks were available on board at a cost - soft drinks, beer, wine and even cocktails. Happy hour saw the price of cocktails drop and they were very enjoyable. You even get to keep the plastic glass as a souvenir. The captain also allowed people to come up and sit in the captains chair and steer the ship and get their photo taken.All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our cruise and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone travelling to the Gold Coast.

I then read some reviews and became a bit worried about what we would find. There is no need to worry!The premises consist of two towers - North and South. We were originally put in the North Tower in a room right next to the lift. Without even going into the room, I went down to see if there was another room we could have as I am a very light sleeper and was worried about the noise from the lifts. Reception kindly moved us to another 2 bedroom ocean view apartment in the South Tower. Room 1225 (this basically means 1 for the South Tower, 22 for the floor and 5 for the room). To say the apartment is spacious would be doing it an injustice! The apartment is huge and you could easily and comfortably stay here for an extended period of time. It is bigger than many peoples homes!Consisting of 2 bedrooms (one with a king bed and the other twin beds), a bathroom, an ensuite, a kitchen, a dining area, a lounge room, a foyer (2nd lounge area) and a large balcony. Both the lounge and the main bedroom have doors leading to the balcony.We were very worried on entering the room as it was very hot. The aircon can actually only do either the living room or the bedrooms, you therefore have to choose which you wanted to cool. For people who hate the heat and humidity, this worried us, but after it had been on for a while, we found that cooling the living room cooled every room down anyway.After spending a couple of nights in the room, I don't believe we would have heard anything if we had remained in the first room as the walls seem to be soundproof. The windows however are not, meaning you can hear sirens, people from the streets below (even from the 22nd floor!) This wasn't much of an issue though.The shower pressure was probably the best shower pressure I've ever had from any hotel all around the world. The bed was also very comfortable. The balcony provided a great view over Surfers Paradise - even though it is situated a couple of blocks from the beach, there were great views of the beach. We were also lucky as our room was on the end of the building and when you walked into the room you are in this little foyer/second lounge area which had floor to ceiling windows out over the Nerang River. As it was raining the whole time we were there (and the balcony was wet and windy, we found ourselves sitting on the sofa and looking out the river side probably more than the beach side! The premises has multiple pools (3 large pools) as well as a spa - which we took advantage of even in the rain. One of them is heated and indoors so there is something for everyone. Also there is a very large gym as well. There are no restaurants/cafes on site, however they are all located within a few minutes walk of the hotel. Right underneath the hotel in the Circle is a Woolworths and a few other shops. The hotel provides free parking for guests in a large car park underneath - you have to go into reception first and then you will be given an access fob and a car space number. This can be quite confusing trying to find your particular space to park in with multiple levels and the numbering not always going sequentially. There are also two lifts, one for the South Tower and one for the North Tower. This was also very confusing and there isn't enough signage to assist guests. The reception can only be accessed via the South Tower. If you are staying in the North Tower then you need to take the lift to level 4 and cross over the walkway to the South Tower lifts and then go down to reception.Also they were doing work in the car park while we were there - I think they were drilling into the concrete and there is apparently major works going on. This means that all the cars get covered in a white powder dust and it is very hard to breathe on the way to the car.All in all, you can't beat the location of these apartments, the space they provide and the comfort for your stay. We will definitely return!

Based around different rivers in the world, you get to see the wildlife that makes these rivers their home. The absolute best part of the River Safari zoo is the Giant Pandas. They are so adorable and nicely posed for us up trees etc. They are housed in a fully air-conditioned enclosure which is actually like walking into a fridge/freezer so it is lovely to go into on a hot and humid Singapore day (every day!)
TimandKath|BCE8A202A1B8C230DD3CF6E11394B3FC|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|4| “Great day out”|review_465187778|Universal Studios is a great day out and brings out the inner kid in us all. The rides are good and there are a good amount of options for those who don't like things like roller coasters. The best ride was probably the Jurassic Park rapids ride, however you do get wet! We didn't mind at all as it was such a hot day that some splashes were nice, however sitting around in wet shoes all day is not nice. Make sure that you take shoes that it doesn't matter if they get wet as they will easily dry! We purchased the front of line pass - and although we didn't go on a number of rides (all the roller coasters) it was still worth the purchase. Some of the rides had wait times of 45-75 minutes, yet with the front of line pass you go right to the front and get through immediately. It is very hot at Universal Studios so try to choose a cooler day to go.
TimandKath|BCE8A202A1B8C230DD3CF6E11394B3FC|Attractions|Singapore: Night Safari|5| “Amazing zoo with a difference”|review_465187135|You should not go here if you are only interested in taking photos of animals, however you should go here if you are interested in seeing animals. All animals, in their natural environment, actively doing things (eating, roaring, moving about etc). As this is a night safari, it is dark and taking good photos is impossible (you cannot use your flash). What this does though, is gives you a chance to really see the animals. It's amazing as they are all out active, not sleeping like you get in the normal zoos. The Creatures of the Night show is fantastic and I definitely recommend it. There are only a few of these shows a night (weather dependent) so make sure you get in early so you don't miss out. The train is a great way to see the majority of the animals, but don't forget to get off and do the walking trails, as you can rejoin the train at any time.

It is only open between 3pm - 6pm daily and it can be quite a wait as they only have 2 lifts operating so only so many people can access the floor at once. It is rare nowadays to find somewhere like this with such amazing views which is absolutely free! A must do as it gives you some amazing photo opportunities.

It offers amazing views of Singapore and if there is a cruise ship in port, you will most likely find yourself travelling straight over the top of it. This is not for the faint-hearted though, as it is quite high up. When returning at night it can be even scarier. Especially as all the windows were open and there was quite a wind so the car was blowing around quite a lot.

It is in a strange location, with not much else around it making it feel a bit forgotten or neglected. They don't tend to overcrowd the capsules (there was only 6 people in ours) but that might be because there weren't a lot of tourists there - it is certainly nothing like the busyness of the London Eye. It does offer an amazing view over Singapore and if you go close to sunset you can get some great photos of the sun setting behind the buildings.

You can feel the rush of the waterfall (and even get right under it if you really want to) and walk along the suspended walkway admiring the view of Singapore and the gardens at the same time.

You will be pleasantly surprised and as both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are kept air-conditioned, this makes a great place to visit on a hot day. We thought we'd only be there for a short time but we spent half a day there, and could have spent longer, only we left it too late to go. The Cloud Forest include a walk on a suspended bridge and a large waterfall - both of which are fantastic. The Flower Dome will have you taking more photos of flowers than you have ever taken before! It is very tranquil and relaxing.
TimandKath|BCE8A202A1B8C230DD3CF6E11394B3FC|Hotel|Singapore: Swissotel Merchant Court Singapore|5| “Amazing base for a stay in Singapore”|review_465182797|We stayed at Swissotel for 9 nights in Feb/Mar while on holiday in Singapore for the first time and it couldn’t have been a better base.We had one of their Premier Rooms (room 580) which had a king bed. Our first night was quite uncomfortable as the bed was very hard, however in the morning we found they had a full pillow menu available including being able to request a mattress topper. We requested this when we went out and when we came back it was to find an amazingly comfortable bed and pillows!I'm not sure if any of the rooms get a view of Clarke Quay - in the photos of the hotel it looks like they all look over the pool and Clarke Quay, however on the floors on the sides of the hotel, these windows are all along the corridor and the rooms are on the other side of the corridor. We overlooked a street and it was still a pleasant enough view out the window, however we really weren't in the room to enjoy it much!The room was very spacious and the air-conditioning works well, being fully adjustable making it pleasant to come home to after a long day of sightseeing. We would leave a key in the power so that the room would be nice and cool when we got back. The room has blackout drapes, a usable fridge with a minibar, an in-room safe and bathrobes and slippers. The best part is that the room also comes with a Handy phone – this is basically a mobile phone for you to use during your stay. This includes free international calls (as many as you want), internet services outside the hotel and access to big savings on all the attractions around Singapore. We saved heaps by buying our tickets using this phone. You would then be either emailed your e-tickets to show at the attraction or you would be emailed something to print. Printing is available by seeing the Concierge. Some examples of savings are the Gardens by the Bay down from $28 to $18 per person, the aquarium on Sentosa down from $34 to $20.90 per person – so well worth doing, especially if you have a big family!You also get 2 complimentary bottles of water every day which is a nice touch. The swimming pool is excellent. There is a large pool with a water slide as well as a smaller kids pool with its own water slide and an outdoor Jacuzzi. We found the best time to swim (with minimal people) was last thing at night between 9pm and 10pm. It’s lovely to cool down after a long day.The only negatives are that the bath is over the shower and it is quite high to get in and out of. The fact that the shower sliding door doesn’t open right up also makes it more difficult. I had trouble and I’m in my 30’s. If you are elderly or have an injury, ask for a room without the bath.Also, the breakfast is on the expensive side as far as hotels go. The buffet breakfast will cost you $36 plus 10% service charge and 7% GST, making it over $42. We had the a la carte breakfast in the same restaurant and while the cost wasn’t too bad - $18 for eggs benedict (plus 17%) and $16 for Croque Monsieur (plus 17%) we were a bit shocked when we saw the bill was for $61. We had ordered 2 orange juices and these came to $10.53 (including the 17%) each! That is the most expensive glass of orange juice I’ve ever had. After this day, we found a wonderful little place across the road in the Clarke Quay Central called Kraftwich – you can get a freshly squeezed orange juice (much nicer than the hotel one) for a fraction of the cost!Two drinks at the hotel bar will also set you back over $30.00. We ordered a glass of wine and a beer and this came to $34.00 – however saying this – this is a pretty standard cost for alcohol across Singapore.The location of the hotel is amazing – right in the heart of Clarke Quay. There are restaurants and cafes everywhere to choose from for breakfast (although most don’t seem to open before about 11am), lunch and dinner. For dinner, you need to get in early, as the locals eat later and the place fills up quickly. We never had an issue with the noise from Clarke Quay, or from any other guests at all. The room was quiet and it was great being able to see a part of the Quay and hear the music from the pool at night.The Clarke Quay MRT (train station) is directly across the road in Clarke Quay Central, or there is another entry to the station behind the hotel. This one is great if it is raining as you walk along the side of the hotel undercover the whole way. Travelling on the MRT is easy and efficient – they come every 2-4 minutes. Overall, we would rate this hotel as a 9 out of 10 as it was very comfortable, quiet and you couldn’t beat the location. We would definitely stay again the next time we come to Singapore.

There is nothing better on a sunny day that being on or around the harbour. Whether it is catching a ferry to Manly, or even just around to Darling Harbour it is a treat for young and old alike. The harbour during times like Vivid and New Years Eve just comes alive and you can while away many hours watching the ships come in and out. The cruise ships are always a treat to see arriving or departing.

As Vivid was on in Sydney we chose this hotel as we wanted an unobstructed view of the Harbour Bridge and Opera House. We booked a Deluxe Full Harbour View Room and were given room 1714.Well we weren't disappointed! The view was amazing with a very clear view of the bridge, opera house and Circular Quay. We also had the best view of the cruise ships that were docked at the port and really enjoyed watching 3 different cruise ships come and go in that time. The room was quite spacious for one of the smaller rooms on offer and featured a king bed, a fridge which contained the mini bar but also had enough space to use (an essential for us), a separate shower and bath in the bathroom, a table and 2 chairs - which we placed in front of the window to watch the world go by. Free wifi was good, fast and reliable.The hotel itself was lovely with staff very friendly and helpful. We were delighted to come back to the room on our first night and find a bottle of sparkling wine in an ice bucket. This went down a treat while we enjoyed the view. I can tell you that the bottle was not a cheap one either ($180!). This was a lovely anniversary surprise. Housekeeping come around several times a day and on the last time they offer to turn down the bed. Complimentary bottles of water are refreshed daily - which is a really nice touch. The hotel is located right at the end of Circular Quay and is very close to all the ferries (going to Manly, Darling Harbour etc) and the train station. You can catch the airport train to and from the airport straight to Circular Quay station and then it is a couple of minutes walk to the hotel. Perfect! It is approx 10 - 15 minutes walk to the CBD, Pitt St Mall etc.My only issue with the room was the toilet. Due to the placement of the toilet next to the shower, there is very little space. Unfortunately the toilet paper holders have been put in the worst position (exactly at leg level) so you really have to take the toilet paper off the holder to sit comfortably. The toilet is also very hard to flush - you have to hold the button down hard for approx 30 seconds for it to flush.These were very minor things though and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. This is the best hotel to stay in if you are wanting a view of the harbour. These rooms would be absolutely fantastic during Vivid and New Years Eve (or anytime of the year really)! We will definitely be back.

I was sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with my mother. We had already decided beforehand to book this hotel and she would have the single bed room as I am much taller and am well past single beds. When we arrived it was to find that the one bathroom in the place was a very tiny ensuite off the double room. As she needs to get up and go to the toilet multiple times during the night there was no way around it. I got the single. Sharing the small ensuite was annoying and you couldn't swing a cat in either the toilet or the shower. I definitely wouldn't want to share with someone I didn't know well as midnight trips to the bathroom/toilet have to be made through the other person's bedroom!The single bedroom was no bigger than my closet at home and both beds were hard and uncomfortable. The single bed when sat on was broken and it made for 5 nights of misery and no sleep. We did try and swap to another room but were told all rooms were the same, all we could do was get 2 single rooms at another $1000 each. As we had already spent $1225 for 5 nights there was no way we would have paid that! All in all a very disappointing stay. The lounge room was ok with a comfortable couch and a big flatscreen TV. The hotel was right on the South Perth foreshore, not that we would have known as there was no view. Most of the windows were frosted glass and you couldn't see out at all. Location is good next to the Mends St ferry which goes to the city but the place needs to be renovated badly.

There are some good passes going in combination with the Hop On Hop Off bus though so it is definitely worth doing if you haven't been to one before. We were a bit disappointed that we got ushered into a show and then when it was over we were at the exit and couldn't go back, despite not seeing the last floor.

The VIP passes are worth doing as you don't have to line up at all for rides/attractions. The price of food is astronomical though! I couldn't get over the price for ice-cream! The animal actors show was very good and interactive. Just beware on the large escalators. We had a tourist in front of us who was taking photos and she stepped back to take the photo and of course fell down the step and backwards into my husband. My husband and her would have gone flying if I hadn't grabbed onto his arm. I had to haul him back up and then he helped her up. Very dangerous!

We flew back into LA about 10pm and caught the Hilton free shuttle. The driver was very friendly and customer orientated. Unfortunately the service at the hotel was not as receptive upon arrival. At the time we were there the Amma tour was there with thousands of people, consequently the check in desk was extremely busy and we ended up waiting to check in to our room for at least 40 minutes. Not the best when you are tired, hungry and just want to get to your room. Likewise the whole place over the two days was swarming with people and the lifts were always full etc. The hotel room was as per a normal Hilton - nice comfortable bed, spacious room. The bathroom was a little old and in need to repairs. Overall due to the closeness of the airport and the benefit of the airport shuttle - this is a good option for layovers. The LA Hop on Hop Off bus also leaves from just outside the hotel and goes all over LA. We caught the bus down to Santa Monica Pier and then to a shopping centre and got a taxi back to the hotel. The taxi cost was very reasonable so it seems to be a good base to do other things. There are also a number of restaurants etc in the area.

We got absolutely drenched coming down on the luge, everyone's hands were so white from holding the handle bars and it being freezing cold. They closed the luge at the end of our first ride due to the storm but we still had other rides we had purchased so we had to wait around for it to reopen. Luckily there were lots of good food options and a nice warm/dry place to wait. A great day out for the family as long as it is sunny!

Our room wasn't ready so they upgraded us to a Suite on the top floor! This was the nicest room we had in our whole trip through America and Canada. The suite was amazing! A huge bedroom with the most comfortable king size bed and a large TV which made you just want to stay in bed and watch tv despite being on holiday! The spacious bathroom had heated flooring, a heated toilet seat and LED lighting in the toilet - first time I had ever seen this but it made for an amusing trip to the toilet in the night. There was a very large lounge, with sofa, TV, desk, coffee table and a combined kitchen/dining room. The room also had a large balcony with table and chairs. Really this was everything you could ask for and hope for on an extended stay somewhere and we really wish we had been staying for more than 2 nights!The hotel does a complimentary breakfast down in the dining room in the morning which caters a cold and hot breakfast - this was very good particularly because it was included. Parking at the hotel was easy to use and no issues.The area is very good as there are a lot of restaurants, cafes, supermarkets within a couple of blocks. It is also a short walk (about 10 minutes) to the tram stop which takes you right into the city and to the Calgary Tower.The service was excellent and they were always trying to help - offering umbrellas when it was raining etc. It was a fantastic stay and we would definitely stay again if going back to Calgary.

This was because the ground floor was very noisy from the person upstairs. Each time they moved the floor would creak and wake us.Will on reception was great at changing our room and offered to help us move due to the stairs to the second floor.The room was nice and had a balcony with view of the mountains. There is a TV, coffee maker, fridge and free wifi, though it did have issues at being slow a lot.The bed was comfy and we had room service for breakfast a few times which was great and they don't have a service charge per order which was good.The hotel is on the outskirts of Banff but with a car, it was perfect location. The drive was a few minutes to town and the opposite direction took you up a nice scenic mountain drive with a great lookout.The parking was free and appeared to be plenty of spots.We really enjoyed our time here and the staff were all fantastic!

It was very lovely and set in the forest but still quite close to the lake Louise village and the actual lake.Customer service was fantastic, very helpful and friendly.Room consisted of double bed with ensuite and kitchen facilities. For us, the bed was small but have noticed this at several hotels in the Rocky Mountains. The bathroom was roomy enough and fixtures were all modern so even though you are in a wooden cabin, there is still a lot of modern twists, it was nice.The cabin did happen to have a lean which you soon got used to and was no problem.This hotel is really only suitable if you have a car and parking is free next to your cabin.Wifi is included but only one passcode per guest so keep this in mind, others can be purchased for a cost.There is a lot of areas where you can wonder the grounds and sit on a bench or swing which was lovely as well.The heating works well but there is no air conditioning, however the cabin stayed warm at night and cool in the day.

We checked in late about 9.30pm and went to our room. We had booked a loft suite and on seeing it, was dissapointed that the stairs would be too much for my wife after a recent injury. We went to the hotel restaurant before they closed and after asked reception if another room on a single level was available. Luckily for us it was so we ended up in room 247. It was a reasonable room which had the main bedroom in a separate room to the living and kitchen. The bathroom was tiny, just enough room to get the door closed before using the loo.There is also an upstairs with 3 single beds but we didn't use this area.The bedroom was small with a queen bed and 2 bedside tables and lamps. The bed was comfortable.The shower was in the bath but lacked pressure.There is free wifi which worked well on the first night, but not so well in day 2 but most likely due to weather conditions that day. The rest of our stay it was perfect.As others have mentioned the lack of aircon I won't go into that again, but yes it got hot while we were here, the fan in the room does help however.Overall it is a nice hotel that caters for what you'll need while in Jasper, just don't expect a 5 star City hotel like a Hilton. It is a short walk to the town centre but a car is needed to see the amazing sights this town has to offer!The staff were great and the restaurant food and service was fantastic!
TimandKath|BCE8A202A1B8C230DD3CF6E11394B3FC|Hotel|Vancouver: Embarc Vancouver|4| “Decent hotel”|review_277115411|We booked this hotel for 3 nights in May and another night a few days later in a return trip to Vancouver.It is a short walk from one of tge canada line train stations in the city which comes directly from the airport. It occupies the top 3 floors of another building.Checkin was easy and each time were given the access code for free wifi. If entering From Hornby street, you need to go up the escalators to reception. The room is large with a double bed, tv, fridge, microwave, toaster and kettle. The windows go from floor to ceiling and give a great view. The bathroom is a nice size snd water pressure is good.One thing about the bed is that one our first stay, the sides of the mattress were very soft and we almost rolled out of the bed. We placed a pillow underneath on each side and this helps. Stay 2 was much better so rectification was not needed. There are some cafes and shops not far away as well and the hop on hop off bus stops across the road.All in all, its a decent hotel that offers everything you might need.

She gave us a card to allow access to the parking garage and would call when our room was ready.On checking in later we were given a free upgrade to a king suite on the third floor overlooking the pool. It was fantastic and we also had a plate with a large brownie slice with chocolate sauce and berries waiting for us on the table as well as a Polaroid camera for our special occasion.There is plenty of space in this room which has heating, cooling, free wifi, TV, iPad on bedside, a mini fridge, sofa, table and 4 chairs, cheapest snacks for a hotel ever, and basic kitchen facilities. We went to the marketplace IGA and bought some things to have breakfast in the room so saved heaps that way. The bed was really comfy and we slept well every night.Location wise, the hotel is in a great spot and nice and quiet. It's only minutes away from the pedestrian area of whistler. The bathroom is slightly small and the water pressure could have been better.Overall we were very happy here and would choose again in our return.While in Whistler, do yourself a favour and book a tour with Michael at Bear viewing ecotours. We also reviewed this and cannot recommend it high enough!

It was amazing!Michael was our guide and boy he really knows his stuff. The tour had 5 people plus Michael in the 4wd. It could hold another 2 comfortably or 3 at a stretch. Leg room was good in the back too.Our first point of call was whistler mountain where he said we might see some bears. We saw the alpha male Slumber first. He was huge and about 100m away. In the same spot we saw a mother and 2 yearlings about 50m away. They scampered away after spotting Slumber who then came much closer, and even crossed the road not far in front of us.Higher up we spotted another mother with 2 yearlings playing about on a patch of unmelted snow. Shortly after they came to within about 25m of us. It was fantastic to witness them in the wild.We headed over to blackcomb mountain next and saw another mother with 2 young Cubs. These came close by and crossed the road near us before the Cubs climbed up a tree.We saw a total of 14 bears on our tour which was plenty and every time we got out of the car to take photos. We had plenty of time as well and the tour lasted about 3 hours.Along with the Bears there is also very beautiful scenery to see along the way. We even went directly beneath the peak to peak gondola on our travels.This is a must do tour on your trip to whistler and you won't regret it!

He said you'd have to wait in line but it would be worth it - he was right!It was the best fish and chips we'd had in a long time. The fish was beautifully cook with a nice batter.The staff are also very personable and while ordering, they make you feel like the most important person at that moment.There is a wait to be served but this is all down to them being so good!Highly recommend eating here.

TimandKath|BCE8A202A1B8C230DD3CF6E11394B3FC|Attractions|Las Vegas: Maverick Helicopters|5| “Great trip”|review_274199497|We booked the Wind Dancer tour with Maverick and had a great time. They picked us up at MGM in a van and took us to the heliport for check in and weigh in. There were numerous other people there and once everyone is checked in they decide who is going in which helicopter. Our pilot was Chris and the whole 7 seats were taken. Chris was friendly and knowledgeable for the whole trip. The trip lasted 4 hours from hotel to hotel. We made 2 stops on the way. One inside the canyon for a drink and some nibbles and one for a quick refuelling of the helicopter. You got a great view of the strip on the way out and back. I would definitely choose Maverick again if we were going to do the trip again ever.
TimandKath|BCE8A202A1B8C230DD3CF6E11394B3FC|Hotel|Las Vegas: MGM Grand Hotel and Casino|4| “Great location”|review_274116429|We stayed at the MGM for 4 nights and got a room on the 15th floor. The room was large and spatious, had a comfortable king bed and was very clean. Our view out the window was of the monorail and Hooters. Not exactly the Strip view that we thought we had booked. Realistically the view doesn't matter as Vegas is a 24/7 town, you will not see much of your hotel room. We didn't return until around midnight every night and by then you want to get to bed, not be looking out the window. We took a taxi to the hotel from the airport which cost about $22. The location of the hotel is right at the southern end of the strip and was perfect for us. There are so many restaurant and food options both in the hotel and on the strip. We aalso saw David Copperfield who has a show at the MGM, this was really entertaining and good. For first time visitors to Vegas who ard interestec in doing and seeing a bit more than the casino, partying or drinking, make sure you have comfy shoes. We walked a lot of the strip on our last day and it was 18km walking! The hotel really has everything you need and was one of the best that we went into. The only downside was the noise. The rooms are not soundproof at all and our room was facing the airport. Therefore from about 7am to 9-10pm you have not only lots of planes but also the helicopters buzzing constantly overhead. The worst thing though was our last night. We had a morning flight out of Vegas and headed to bed about 12.30am, unfortunately this was the time that the room oppositeand next to us checked in. From then until 3.30am there was loud talking, constant door slamming and running up and down the corridor. At 3.30am we had finally had enough and rang reception. Security was straight on it came up and told them to go to bed (we think). They quietened down but the about 20 mins later we had another person with a stereo walking down the hotel hallway with a sterro blaring music (by now it was 4am). We then had a couple coming back for the night and having a deep and meaningful in the hall. I went down to reception to complain and passed multiple young females passed out at the end of the hall near the lifts. It didnt seem like the hotel had cameras or were keeping an eye on these sorts of things. Maybe ask for a quiet room (if they have one) if you plan on sleeping.

My mistake for not checking the ticket when bought but was rushing for the Tesla Coil show at the Science Centre.The movies were not as spellbounding as before. Lots of CGIs which make it look like a morning cartoon TV programme. I remembered when I was younger, the Omni theatre showed a movie on outer space, black holes, quarks...now that would amaze anyone - adult or kids! I would suggest to bring that back!

The PA system was below par - disappointing!The food was good with a good variety of dishes for breakfast. My only comment about the breakfast was that the "nasi lemak" requires a boiled egg or fried egg to go with it and not scrambled eggs...Otherwise, it was clean, brand new looking hotel with all the necessities required for both business and leisure trips.

Just had to walk less than 10 mins and you have both Coles and Woolworth's for your shopping needs. Westfield is just straight up the road. Hop across to George Street and you're on your way to either Chinatown, Thainatown or Korean Town. The opposite direction would bring you to The Rocks or Circular Quay. To the West, you can walk across to Darling harbour in 10-15 mins stroll. Numerous bars and cafes for all your meals including breakfast. Room is adequately sized and the beds were comfortable. Concierge was available to help store your luggage while you wait to check-in or for your ride back to the airport. Would I consider Metro Hotel at the Pitt again? Yes, if they keep up the standards.

The welcoming staff and concierge was superb.The selection of food for breakfast is very good. You get a good view of the city from the hotel.Like all reviews, there is a downside to this hotel. Getting budget taxis is difficult. All the taxis that go via Trader's Hotel is premium taxis (i.e. premium price). I got a double bedroom which was quite small. A staff at the restaurant was selective in her hospitality. She was rather curt and generally unhelpful to locals (I am a local) but went out of her way to serve the others. I find this discrimination rather disappointing in this day and age. Guess some people still have the colonial mentality.

Previously called Holiday Inn. Fist impression wasn't that great as we were left standing a bit with loads of luggage and 2 children at the front entrance with no dropping off space and doorman. To be fair, I think there was some VIP (Johor EXCO) in the building... wonder why they have the need to block up the front entrances with their cars when they have drivers that could park it properly for them elsewhere. (Unless the driver is a VIP too!). Then, my room wasn't ready when I checked in at 2pm. Got my family and I to wait for about an hour with our luggage on a trolley. The check in and check out counters were not labelled. I was caught standing in the wrong queue. I tried looking for a sign but definitely no signs of it. So, commented to the receptionist.Then, to the hotel's saving grace, they upgraded my room from superior to deluxe for free... everything was better... the room was nice and room service was good. I think there was some piano exams going on upstairs and someone was tuning the piano for hours which annoyed me in the room. Couldn't sleep properly.I loved the location as it's next door to Holiday Plaza and nearby food stalls.That's my two cents... it's a good hotel but still has some more room for improvement for a 4 star hotel.

My brorher in-law and I had booked the 9am snorkel the wreck tour. Our tender arrived nearly 20 minutes late at 9:18 and we were told our tour had been rescheduled due to being late (weather and ship fault not ours) and they didnt want it to make the rest of the tours late for rest of the day. We had to cancel the snorkel all together as we had booked other tours during the day with our wives and kids and were only able to do the 9am session. We ended up settling for the 10am Segway tour instead which was the same price but half the time. We enjoyed it but it was not what we came to the island for. Our families joined us for the 11:45 Marine Park Scenic Cruise and guess what that tour was half an hour late to start. Guess it's ok to run that late but not the snorkel. The guy on the Marine Cruise spent more time talking about coming from Harbord near Manly then about the Island unless he was asked a question. Overall the Island is beautifull but the service is very very poor.

The continental breakfast was the same as you get anywhere else. Overall for cheap and close to Disney it is for you.

The room smelled of damp mildew, was very outdated i thought i was in the 60's judging by the decor. Staff were quite rude and looked like expecting a tip just for checking me in. Charging people $10 to park in a unsecure and uncovered parking lot across the road from the hotel in a gravel lot is also very mean spirited. Only good thing was it was beachfront (even though their section is covered in cigarette butts). if you are on a budget and have no taste this is for you, otherwise i suggest you find a few extra dollars and go elsewhere.

We stayed for 2 nights but chose not to eat at the hotel as it was quite expensive for what was on offer. The room was a nice size and we were told we were given a water view room, it was only a water view if you squinted through the trees or it rained. The "beach" was a let down as the photos on the website make it look alot bigger than it really is and it gets filled up by cruise ship passengers and hotel guests get no equipment to use as the cruise people crowd it all. Overall we did enjoy our stay but the hotel should focus more on patrons who payed the big money to sleep there instead of obnoxious cruise passengers paying alot less just to use the beach.

Only some very minor issues were that out of the 3 apartments only 1 had an ashtray, only 1 had a tray to bake on in the oven.

The boat was nice and large, very fast trip out to the 2 reefs. The snorkelling gear provided was excellent as was the choice of reefs. We paid the $50 for the hire of an underwater camera and loved how our photos turned out as well as the professional ones already on the disc. Only a few minor issues: Lunch. I was under the expectation that the lunch provided would also come with drinks, but no if you wanted anything to drink for free at lunch you had to use a water bubbler on the back deck other wise all liquids at lunch you had to pay for. Next up was staff, most of the staff were excellent (especially Elvis) but 2 people really got me uncomfortable, one of them (don't know his name but his accent sounded maybe South African) was very touchy feely around all the young female backpackers on the boat and alot of them looked awkward when he was doing it. The next was one of the guys on the back deck when everyone was in the water, I overheard him when I came onboard for some water making jokes about my wife (a larger person) and other larger than average sized people that were in the water. I would have said something but did not want to embarress my wife or any of the others he was mocking. Apart from that we had a great day out with only those minor blemishes.

On this particular occasion, we noted there are some serious flaws with staying here. The location and external appearance of Darby Park is great, but it is let down by the design of the rooms and the amenity provided in the rooms.The acoustics of the rooms are poor, to the point that you can hear the bathroom being used in the room next door. The bed is rock hard and the pillows feel like you are sleeping on a bag of cement. Whilst not a major issue, the bathrooms are in need of a thorough tile clean, and it was a little inconvenient to have a shower that is not adjustable.Could be a lot better with a few improvements.

Getting to the park is relatively easy, by taking either the Sentosa Express or cable cars to Sentosa, which are close to MRT network.If visiting as a couple with the other half not too interested in the 'big' rides, this saves you a lot of time, particularly as the 'big' rides (the rollercoasters, basically) allow single riders. This saves a lot of time, particularly as during peak times these rides have waiting times varying for between the 45 and 90 minutes. I would recommend going on the 'big' rides in the first hour or two of opening, as you will be disappointed otherwise. You can buy a pass which allows you express entry onto these rides, but this costs about $60 extra, so can result in an expensive day out.Even a few of the family friendly rides are worth a go, even if you don't have kids with you (Puss in Boots and Sesame Street). We queued over an hour for the Madagascar ride, and to be fair, this is pretty average and wouldn't recommend doing so.

We booked ahead for a table for two, and were seated in the part of the Tiffin Room away from the main tables, next to the hotel lobby. The staff made us feel welcome, offered us tea and coffee, and promptly brought our cake and sandwich selection. We arrived about 20 minutes early, but the staff had no troubles with us being seated early.Some other reviews on here have referenced the buffet, and how this fits in with the perceived view of the 'high tea'. Personally, I had no issues with this, and being a man who likes his food, took advantage of savoury treats on offer. My only reservation is that I wish I had the appetite to take further trips to the buffet, particularly the samosa and the croque monsieur (or whatever they were called).Going to high tea is a good excuse to 'dress up' for a few hours. If you're issue is with the number of people in attendance at one time, then perhaps a bustling city such as Singapore isn't for you.

As we wanted to site on the terrace and see a view of the City skyline without any particular interest in the restaurants at the Marine Bay Sands, we thought we would give it a go.We opted to book in for drinks and snacks option, which required a minimum $60 spend. I had reserved a spot for 8pm, but unfortunately through no fault of our own the table wasn't available at this time. Despite confirming our booking verbally over the phone and having a record on their booking system, they could not confirm that we would get a booking once we arrived, which was slightly concerning, however, the Manager apologised and offered to waive the charge for the first drink and the minimum spend. I was quite happy to accept this, and by 8:30 we had taken our reserved table. The service thereafter was great, and I apologised for being a bit impatient.The food and drinks are expensive, but that sums up Singapore in general. As it was our honeymoon, it didn't bother us too much. I tried the tasting paddle, and had a couple of extra drinks from the selection. The snacks we tried were decent and tasty. The porter was a particularly good beer, but more of a 'sipping' beer.With the terrace/balcony view, this does come at the price of other people taking photos against the city backdrop. If you don't like this happening, this place isn't for you. We were happy to oblige, but this wouldn't be for everyone.

We arrived about 4 hours early for check-in, but the hotel were happy to store our bags until the room for available.We stayed in a Hillside Pool Villa, in the second to last row of villas at the top of the hill. The room was spacious, the bed was king sized and the room overlooked the pool. The bathroom was a decent size and had another external shower. The pool was a decent size also, but due to quite a bit of rain on the first couple of days, was a bit cold to use until about the third day.I note that there are multiple reviews on here critical of the breakfast, however, we could not have been happier with the huge selection of food on offer. It seemed to cater for all tastes, from your continental style (pastries, cereal, toast, fruit) to the more asian style hot dishes. I never thought I'd be eating Gouda at breakfast, but it was quite enjoyable. The breakfast restaurant area is a decent size, so there's no issues with finding a table.If staying in the main hillside area, the buggy will be your best friend during your stay. One thing that isn't overly clear when booking is the size of the hill . Even for people in our late twenties with a reasonable level of fitness, it would have been quite a challenge, rain or shine. The staff are happy to do drop offs and pick up at the rooms. Upon ringing Reception from the room, we always found the buggy pick up to be quick, usually no more than 5 minutes, which only slowed down during the expected breakfast and early evening 'rush hour' periods. The buggy saved us from quite a few potential drenchings, so kudos to the hotel for offering this service!The restaurants and bars on within the hotel are all good, albeit quite expensive (but Koh Samui generally isn't that cheap). We thankfully got caught in the bar by the beach during a big downpour, so made the most of happy hour on one night. As others have mentioned, Nan at the top pool bar was a laugh, and made some decent cocktails.One thing to note with the hotel is that it is quite a way out of Chaweng, and getting a taxi is quite expensive into Chaweng (Usually 250/300 Baht). If ordering a taxi from the hotel, you'll always end up with one that costs 300 Baht for a one way trip, as none of the apparent cheaper alternatives will show up. The freeshuttle buses into Chaweng are good when they're running, but there's a decent chunk of time during the evening when there's no free shuttle. It would have been better if the hotel ran more, or spaced these out better throughout the evening.My one gripe with the Hillside Villa was the lack of sea view from the pool, mainly due to the height of trees in front. Had the tree in front been cut down by a metre or two, we would have had an unobstructed view of the island off the coast, without impeding on the privacy of the villa in front. This is something for the resort to consider to improve the views had by guests.Overall a decent resort. Will consider coming back if we return to Koh Samui.

After checking in, one of the staff took our bags to the room and showed us how to use the free phone provided. It was quite handy to have this during our stay, as on occasion we did need to phone places to book in for lunch and dinner, with it also providing Google Maps (which came in handy). The phone itself was pretty basic and slow with Google Maps (it lagged quite a bit, and sent us in the wrong direction a couple of times), but was good to have around.We stayed in what would have been one of the standard rooms, with a decent sized double room and ensuite which looked out from the first floor onto the pool area. The window partially looked out onto the roof beneath it, which wasn't all that great, but could have been worse.Probably one of the biggest issues with the room was the ensuite. It appeared that this would have been quite nice a number of years ago, but was in dire need of some TLC. There were a number of cracks in the tiles and the grout was a bit dodgy in some places. Also, for some bizarre reason, the door of the ensuite has semi-open slats, which doesn't exactly give much privacy and make it a bit exposed. The opaque window next to the shower was quite filthy on the other side, with mossy growth and dirt on it.The breakfast itself wasn't bad, but not extensive. I believe it would have cost around SGD $35 if not part of the room deal, which it's a bit on the pricey side for two of you, and you'd probably be better off heading out elsewhere.One thing that baffled me was the lack of pedestrian access to Scotts Road. If coming up from the direction of Orchard MRT you have to walk through the car park to reach the main hotel entrance. Would make sense to have a pedestrian access, rather than having to navigate through the car park.The outdoor swimming pool could use a refurb also. It's very dated, and not particularly attractive. The ladders to enter and exit the pool feel as though they are about to give wayOverall, the hotel is in a great location and isn't too badly priced for Singapore. To make it the 5 star hotel it apparently is supposed be, it needs some work to it.

As neither myself or the other half had an interest in scuba diving, we booked the day trip to the Angthong Marine Park with snorkelling and kayaking.We were picked up from our hotel by a private driver for the short journey to 100 Degree East's headquarters. Upon arrival the tour guide/lead gave us the wifi details, water and details about the day's events prior to the short walk to the boat. Upon arrival at the boat, we were introduced to the rest of the crew. In total we had a total of 5 crew for the 12 guests. The boat itself was clean, modern and well maintained. It did not feel claustrophobic at all and was particularly spacious.The first stop of the trip was for the snorkeling at the islands. Upon disembarking into the water, the crew helped everyone out and guided everyone. Unfortunately the recent weather had meant the water was very murky and we didn't see the fish expected, but this was beyond their control. As a result, we cut the snorkeling short and headed to one of the other islands. Whilst on the island we were guided up a steep hill to one of the viewing areas - a difficult walk, but worth it! Following this, we had lunch which was particularly good.Without rambling on too much more, the tour included stops on the beach, a trip to the lagoon (the one which inspired the book 'The Beach') and kayaking. All of which were fantastically organised. There was an almost endless supply of the water and soft drinks, with the crew offering these to the guests frequently.A big thank you to the 100 Degrees East team.

We booked with Happy Samui due to the lack of available last minutes tours, and the availability of a tour departing in the morning.Happy Samui as a tour company isn't anything different to most tours operating in Koh Samui in that it goes to the same limited 'attractions' as every other tour. Other than a nice viewing area, most are tourist traps which have limited actual sights to look at and mostly include a load of touristy markets. Although no reflection on the tour itself, the tour brochure basically shows you what you will see. As noted by other reviews, the tour has a guide between two buses traversing the same route with a little bit of information at each destination, but by no means extensive. It would have been good to have some commentary on the way, but I don't think think the drivers speak English (which would have helped!) One of the main issues we had with the way the tour is run itself was the amount of time at each place. A few of the stops were excessive for the amount of stuff to see, particularly the first stop at one of the temples and the later stop to waterfall. At both stops we found ourselves waiting at the bus for a while. In the case of the waterfall stop, it wasn't clear that members of the group would be going on elephants, as this wasn't an option in brochure - this wasted further time.

Despite the distance between the hotel and Ubud, the reviews appeared to justify staying at the hotel.I was quite surprised that the hotel is as small as it (about 20 rooms) and is very well staffed. Besides the daily room and clean, the staff also make the beds in the afternoon ( a nice little touch). We stayed in one of the second storey rooms overlooking the pool (by the restaurant), with the room being very spacious and laid out. The balcony was a decent size and provide a nice view of the pool and the nearby temple.As others have previously noted, the hotel is a bit out of the way and isn't close to any restaurants or bars within walking distance. The hotel restaurant provides a decent selection of main meals, and compared to some hotels, is quite reasonably. The included breakfast isn't the buffet you get so often in hotels, but a made to order set menu (about 4 or 5 options to choose from, including American, Continental and Indonesian) which includes fruit and pastries, and of course, the amazing Balinese coffee. The free afternoon tea put on in the afternoon was a particular highlight.The one issue we had with the Puri Gannga was the cockerels. Although it is established through other reviews on TripAdvisor that the cockerels are an issue, it's .not until you stay in this hotel that you realise the gravity of this nuisance. If it was a 6:30/7am wake-up call, you wouldn't mind, but the noise at 3am wasn't great. Perhaps the hotel could consider ways to mitigate this issue, particularly given the proximity to rooms and the fact that people don't generally appreciate early wake up calls when on their holidays.The free shuttle bus to and from Ubud was great, and well utilised by us. Most of the time we were the only people being dropped off or picked up.Overall a highly recommended hotel, minus those birds!

After looking up a few restaurant reviews on Trip Advisor, we came across a few that looked like checking out, although after not writing down the address and getting in a taxi with a driver that clearly didn't know the areas all that well, we took our chances. By chance, we drove past Lacalaca despite this not having been on our radar originally. It would have been about 6:30pm when we got here, and we were the first customers in the for the night, and outnumbered by the staff 8 to 1! It filled up pretty quickly after this point.We had a few of the dishes, including the beef quesidillas and the fajitas, which were the main highlights. We also took advantage of the 2 for 1 cocktails (Mojitos and Margaritas). The wait staff were very attentive and the prices quite reasonable.Will definitely visit again when next in the area.

Also, we love the freebies that came with it.We went on a weekend which explains the long queue but we got to see the parade which is a plus!Not advisable for hot summer days given Singapore's humid weather.The staff at the gate was rude. We went out to exchange our $$ at the money exchange right outside the gate and we were stamped with "invisible" mark for returning in.When we got back after exchanging currencies, she would not let us in. I do not know if that was trickery of some sort to have less people at the park. We asked her what was the "invisible" stamp for if she would not have a way to trace if we were really returning or just trying to sneak. I used to think of theme parks as happy places in Earth. Bad memory of a theme park which ruined how I view places as such.

Came here straight from the airport and while rooms were prepared a very lovely hospitable accommodating Filipina welcomed us with towels and refreshing drinks. She served us fresh fruits and that was the start of a really great two-week vacation throughout the country. She was lovely enough to even give us a suite on the other La Siesta Hotel at no extra cost but we were too tired from the flight and politely declined it, only because we were too lazy to transfer.The room space is enough though not as big as others I've been to. Good air-conditioning. I love the hotel's location because you will see a lot of shops but not close enough to backpacker's area so it's not too loud at night but not too far from happenings. The restaurant served the best pho I've ever tasted throughout VietNam. We'll keep on coming back for sure!

Very little space to move. Just a real good place to sleep after traveling the whole day. A/C is not well maintained and tends to get hot within the room.

Toilet.Central location within KL and close to tourist places. My only concern is )and partly because of our fault, being unable to research) when we ask the staff at the lobby of options going to the airport. Instead of answering, they did a little trick in marketing their transport car service. Also, misinformation since buses are available 5 hrs before the time of our flight. Staff said the bus won't be accessible that time. This is a first we traveled not having enough knowledge because this is more of a spontaneous decision.Pretty nice small rooms and not-bad-toilet. Just have to work on the toilet and cleaning of the toilet too. Some rooms are juxtaposed each other so good luck if you've gotten yourself a noisy neighbour. WiFi is free but most of the times you need to go down to the lobby to access it. Even connecting within the lobby gives you problem.

Friendly and very helpful staff(ROOMS)but the rooms are small, very compact and I had a hard time sleeping due to the SMELLY OLD PILLOWS. I remember resorting in using my clothes as my pillow because the smell was really AWFUL. The toilet is nice and well-cleaned, but then, other days it remains unclean and not neat. They do not replenish toiletries like tissue but then some days they do. Shampoo has foul stench and we have to buy our own from Indomaret nearby. I guess the cleanliness just depends on the room-boy cleaner.(OTHER SERVICES ARRANGEMENT)We wanted to experience Jimabaran Seafood Dining and asked the hotel to arrange it. They recruited an expensive seafood restaurant with transfers from hotel back and forth. I ended up having food poison on that resto.(FOOD)Breakfast is basic.

Tip: try living in the moment, enjoy your stay and be open to new experiences. Here are the facts:We stayed here for the holy week of 2015 and we were not disappointed. Reservations: A bit of a hassle if you contacted directly because signal is weak. Best if booked with agoda. You can still message owner with complete details and expect a worry free reservation once you bank transfer. Dont expect confirmation if signal is weak, even if you call, just bring your deposit slip on time of arrival. You'll be surprised even your requested room has been taken cared of. Rooms:Very very soo much spacious! We rent a room for two and they gave us 2 queen size bed in one room. Socket near head rest. Hot shower. Table. 2 chairs. Wooden design, ceiling, wall. No fan or AC but not needed. RatesThe best of its kind. Cheapest of its kind. Value for money. Extra charge for towel so budget travelers must bring own towel. But 1 room has 4 pillows 2 comforters 2 bed sheets, 2 beds. LocationNear lemon pie house and downtown sagada. But if you carry lots of bag might be tiring til you reach bus terminal.

Utilize the airport pick up offered by them because taxi couldn't even locate it. Even McDonald's delivery had a hard time locating it. Basic room with hot shower and wifi. Stayed here for 1night since we're going to Malapascua and we really don't need a hotel near the city centre. Also, we wanted to catch Mactan Shrine where we can buy the cheapest pasalubong. Very near lapu lapu shrine. Food is ok. Staff is having a hard time communicating except in their own dialect. Accomodating staff though and helpful on directions. Owner must have a way in letting staff know if the guests are already paid because staff didn't let us go without the owner arriving. In sort, we felt being hostage though partly, we were at fault since we didn't bring our proof of payment which we left in Manila. You can stay if you have early flights but not recommended for long stays. Cheap price as well.

Nice friendly humble owner Vivian. In fact I'd advise that best time to visit is when Vivian is in the Phils. Very accommodating. Staff and other upper mngt --- meh. Along the coast of Malapascua, beach front hotels lined up and the part of which with very powdery sands are on the centre. Not too smooth sand on the part of BCBR as it is on the far end and very posh hotels nearby offer more classy elegant lodgings. This one's pretty basic though location offers best view and service is good. Rooms - spacious with AC though not really needed. Hot shower. Wifi. Socket near head rest. With veranda. Astounding view on the left corner room second floor. You can hear the sound of waves at night. Very relaxing. Bar - full of Americans. 2drinks worth 1 every happy hour. You can also mingle with the local girls. Tasty free breakfast with choices of Filipino or American food. Not so hot coffee. Drinkable water has charge. Restaurant inside the hotel but the food is cooked on the adjacent resto outside the hotel so you can go at the outside resto directly instead ordering in the hotel as it costs extra and takes more time bringing the food inside the hotel. They walk from resto to the hotel and the food has no cover. No extra charge for additional towel, linen, pilllow. But you have to request for a new towel if you want one, otherwise you gonna use same one you had yesterday. There's a small store where you can buy unexpected necessities.

Very nice lady ESTELLE, really helpful and the other girl. Quiet place yet near city centre and a good exp in living like a local. Food choices (free bfast) ranges from french toast with egg and fruits to pinoy "silog", includes free coffee or fruit juice. Airport transfers - 1 of 5 of us is leaving on an earlier date and the driver is very kind to give all of us 5 a free ride to the airport and drop us there to send our friend goodbye. Next day, he still happily sent us again to airport.**that day a group of Americans and EUs are going back to airport as well. They were earlier and the car is still in airport but they are so assistive in getting a new car, I think it's more of a family car just to have us not waiting for the American's car to go back. This seldom happens in Bohol. When you're a Filipino traveler, you're discriminated. Vest was different. Excellent service on all guests!Special req's - We bought Kings longganisa in the supermarket late at night (pretty famous in cebu and bohol) and Estelle was very kind to ask their chef not to leave yet and have it cooked. It was delivered on our room with no extra charge! But it has to be charged. But wasn't. Price - good large discounts if you're staying for more than 3nights. Otherwise it's a bit higher compare to other Bohol hotels but definitely value for your money. Location - excellent strategic location not too close to centre so it wasn't noisy but not too far. Its a good walk to ATMs, malls, restos and nearby stores for unexpected needs. Rooms- clean, complete toiletries, choice of new towels just leave it on the floor if you want new one. They clean the room nicely. Spacious rooms. Lots of socket, with ref, AC, wifi. I'd go back here!

One of the dishes came out wrong, they reluctantly changed it after the manager was informed. The fruit juice we order came incorrectly and they refused to change it.The restaurant is also expensive, and unfortunately the money you pay is definitely not worth what you get in exchange.Id go back to the location but i could definitely live without the restaurant.

I was flying to Lembongan from the UK to do my DM and i wanted to stay between 6 and 7 weeks, so before i committed to a particular dive center i research and emailed almost all of the dive centers on the island, this was easier said than done, however the folks at legend were very quick with their responses and they all made sense as they speak very good English (not the case with all of the centers).Price wise they are not the cheapest on the island for the Divemaster internship but they aren't the most expensive. However they are the newest, so all the gear is less than a year old and in very good condition, the boat they use is also new and in good condition. The price you pay is definitely worth the service you get!The guides and instructors are very friendly, knowledgeable and were all willing to help me out with my studies. It was a very good blend of professionalism and enjoyment. There is a guide for every type of person, Harli has eagle vision and can spot just about anything and everything providing its there. I put Yeray under a bit of pressure as i was worried about the currents but he reassured me and kept me from getting into a situation i wouldn't be comfortable in. Jessie is more "by the book" and a bit less flexible than the others but i imagine she would be ideal for beginners and people that are worried - she even saved my behind once as i got caught by the current, she made me feel very safe.The rest of the staff are also great, the captain (Nurata – I hope I spelt that right), the boat hands, the additional people at the shop, they were all happy to help where and when they could.The owners/managers, Ricky and Isabel, were very helpful, they helped me out with everything from the doctor, to places to eat, to accommodation, the whole 9 yards, i couldnt have asked for more. AND because i finished my Divemaster course a couple of days early i was even promised a couple of dives FOC when i was next on the island, which is very kind of them.The Divemaster course itself was paced out to suit me. I took days off when I felt like it and there wasn’t any issues. Thankfully Legend was happy to have me in the water as much as possible, which I massively prefer to being in the classroom. The classroom sessions were also flexible. I was wary when I intitially started looking for dive centers, I wanted people who wanted me to get it right rather than just take my money and have a relaxed attitude to my learning. Overall it was a really good course and im a better diver now than I was before I went.The next time im in Bali I will go back and dive with Legend. I’d recommend them to anyone and everyone. Should I want to become an instructor in the future, I will specifically go back and do it with Legend. It was an all-round excellent experience!Thanks Legend!

The room was basic (like all homestays), but it was comfortable, and they clean your room every 2 days.My room had both AC and a fan, which is always nice, and hot water (most of the time). I did have a problem with the hot water but after mentioning it the problem was solved.The husband and wife that own/run it speak pretty good English for the island and always helped when they could.It's a quiet place on the whole, about a 10 minute walk from the center of the village, but still close to food n shops etc. Its also located near are couple of the better scuba diving shops on the island.

A real fun day out though, beautiful beaches, great look out points and the quokas are fantastic!

There are, what seems to be, thousands of monkeys in the forest, so the chances of you not seeing a monkey are nonexistent. The monkeys can be a little boisterous but i suppose that's only to be expected, but there are a lot of "rangers" around to keep things on the up and up. Buying bunches of bananas does invite the monkeys to just jump and scramble up you without any warning, so if you are concerned but still want to feed the monkeys, do not carry them yourself :) it was a fun day out and i would recommend it.It was around 2 USD to get in and you can spend as much time was you want milling around.

However, it was the nicest western food we ate in the area - sometimes one can have a little too much noodles. The setting (the garden) was really nice. The service was average. It was a little expensive however, and im not talking for bali, we paid around 80 USD for 2 people with 1 glass of wine

The mussels were very nice and came with bottomless french fries, however the steak was a let down, it was tough and rather tasteless despite the sauce.The service on the other hand was very good and everyone was very friendly.I'd go back for the mussels but not the steak. I've rated it average but only because there wasn't a "good" but i wouldn't go so far as to say "very good". It was also kinda of expensive, for that kind of money i was expecting a better meal.

Passages filled with bones and skulls, something you don't see everyday. i wouldn't go again but i'm very glad i went.unless you get there really early, like 45 minutes before the museum opens, there is one hell of a queue, but despite the crowd, it doesn't seem crowed in the tunnels, because of the way they stagger the tourists.There's a fair amount of walking in a confined space so its not really suitable for anyone whose not fond of small spaces.

It was my first time diving in an aquarium and its well worth the experience. Our dive master was a guy named Dick, he was from England so there was no trouble with a language barrier, he was very patient and friendly, everything you want from someone guiding you through the waters. On top of all of that, it was a half day thing, rather than a boat taking you out to see for an hour and then an hour back, we got 2 dives in half a day and were back at the hotel in 15 minutes, it was only me and my buddy in the tank so no one else was getting in the way, I thoroughly recommend it. You also get free entry included to the aquarium so you can also have a wonder about once you're done.

The soft shell crab, tempura prawns on some kind of leaf, both prawn and crab cakes, crab meat curry and clams were all out of this world - mouths watering just remembering it all.The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and were incredibly friendly.Cant rate Kin Dee high enough.Take my advice and go n' enjoy a meal

Kendell M|AF05D6716CCBAF895EFA0418640070AB|Restaurant|Miami: Bahama Breeze|1| “The worst service ever.”|review_494421550|So we had a reservation on Father's Day at 6:00pm. We arrived at 5:45pm and checked in. The hostess advised that we had a 25 minute wait. I could not believe what I heard, so I repeated that we have a 6:00pm reservations. The hostess again advised that, "yes, you still have a 25 minute wait. We are running behind and don't have any servers." Well...6:50pm the hostess finally call us to be seated. The attitude from the hostess was the worst. I will never come back again. What's the use of making reservations?The only reason they get 1 rating is because I can't leave it blank. Truly don't deserve a 1.

The ambience and the service were excellent, however the food left a lot to be desired. We both ordered the steak and eggs and were sorely disappointed. I don't know what cut of steak we were served, but it was tough and tasteless. The egg seems to be made from powdered eggs (the same as McDonald's). Honestly, I expected at the very least real fresh eggs. The bar scene and ambience was fine but in good conscience I cannot recommend this restaurant for food.

For two weeks everything was taken care of and I didn't have to ask for anything. The only reason I'm giving this hotel 4 stars is because I did not get into my room until 5 PM even though check in time is 3 PM and had to wait in the lobby for my room to be cleaned. However everything else as far as service was top-notch. My room attendant, Donna, was absolutely the best! She was kind,courteous and very helpful with anything I needed. Adrienne, the bartender was the best! She remembered everyone's names and was very charming. She had such an outgoing personality that she got a room full of strangers to talk and have a good time. The hotel was always clean and all the staff were friendly. I will definitely be back.

We was given an option to sit on the higher table if we do not want to queue. We took up the offer and ordered Chocolate Crepe, Signature Crepe, Checkers, Lady M Ice Cafe and Hot Chocolate. Tried and very disappointed. I think they are overrated. Crepes are very sweet and my chocolate drink is way beyond nice. Checkers are tataseless and the is not neat when the chocolate and vanilla sponge cake is being stack together. Even Starbucks hot chocolate is so much better in term of chocolate richness and taste. We did not even finish all our order an leave. To pay about $9 for a crepe is ok if the taste is good. Will not return for a time being. We also waited for very long for our order to be taken.

Dinner was superb and service great. Price is not too bad, say £250-300 with wine, starters, mains and desserts for two. Shows were great and then dance club late into the night.But if you don't have good table, don't bother going because I think the shows made the restaurant worth visiting. Ibiza is peppered with good food so this place without the show would suffer from competition.Tips: make sure your hotel concierge books tables opposite the stage, second row from the stage. You won't want the first row/ next to stage as you ll get splashed!Book dinner for 10:30pm. Saturday or Friday shows are the best. Book weeks Or months in advance

Background: backpacking (sleeping rough) Europe for 1 month; adventure travel in Egypt for 1 week (2-3 stars hotels); 2/3 star hotel Tunisia; 4 star hotel Maldives half board; 4 star Thailand; 4-5 hotels in Malaysia; 4 star hotel Hong Kong, Bali, Beijing, Singapore; various 2-4 star hotels across China; 5 star hotel in Cancun; 4 star hotels Switzerland, France, Spain.Pros of this hotel:Very very excellent staff ( One staff even drove to another town just to get us tickets we asked to reserve online because online reservation was closed)LOvely spacious roomComfortable beddingCleanLovely turn down service with chocolatesfree service of taxi into townLocation - walkable to the old town belowCons:maybe location could be better if closer to shop? if you want to see more; you may need to consider hiring a car; but this is true of Ibiza island. Ibiza should be explored by car.No lively clubbing scene within walking distance (if this is your sort of thing) No gym, pool is too small to do any meaningful swimmingConclusion: Highly recommended. For swimming, drive to the Cala bAssa beach.Note: No spa available
markwiles|FF869FFA768697EA2A3F3BDC6B3DD98B|Hotel|Jakarta: Amaris Hotel Thamrin City|2| “Very basic”|review_151016323|Stayed for 2 nights, my brother selected this hotel because of proximity to eateries ground floor of building.My background: done backpacking (sleeping rough) Europe for 1 month; gone to adventure travel in Egypt (2/3 stars hotels; done 3-5 stars hotels around the world (Cancun; Switzerland;Spain; France; Italy; Maldives; Far East; China).Pros of this hotel:CleanFriendly and polite staffComfortable pillows and double bedStrong air conditioningFree wifiCons:No wardrobe/anywhere to hang clothesSmallNo windows (one window that showed one of the corridors of the hotel; hence people can peek into your room! Nice!)Smoking permitted so can smell smoke in corridors then into your roomShower temperature variableLocation not so good (bad because taxis in Jakarta is unreliable)No hair dryerNo kettle for hot water (tho they left 2 mugs in the room!)No light snacksNo hangersNo gym/poolConclusion:I would recommend this place if you are a solo traveller; who dont mind very basic comfort; in need of a place to stay for few hours (like check in midnight and checkout 5 am).
markwiles|FF869FFA768697EA2A3F3BDC6B3DD98B|Hotel|Cancun: Le Blanc Spa Resort|5| “The Best Holiday Ever!”|review_24014718|We booked our wedding and honeymoon at Le Blanc after reading Trip Advisor. It was an excellent choice! I have travelled as a backpacker in Europe, stayed in 4 star hotels in South east Asia, stayed in bad and good hotels in major UK cities; but I was truly amazed at the dedication and attitude of the staff at Le Blanc in delivering a top-notch service. I felt totally immersed in relaxation for 2 weeks. I have never totally felt relaxed on any holiday (not even when I visited my folks!) previously.The hotel is minimalistic in design, clean and fresh. It is well maintained. The dining experience is of a high standard. There are only few times when I thought the service was a tad slow but that is due the large size of our party.Our room faces the ocean and every room has jacuzzi. Our butler were Eduardo and Javier and they are truly helpful despite some hiccups in English-Spanish translation.I did not use the spa as i felt the services there are very overpriced. i had plenty of spa services in the UK and SE Asia and I cannot justify the prices at Le Blanc. However, I took full advantage of the gym and also the classes (pilates, yoga) offered. The pools were very nice and clean and they are not always full, thanks to the fact that the hotel occupancy is only 260. The beach is also very nice and clean. Water is great. The location of the hotel was excellent as it is only about 500m from the party zone! Not far from Coco Bongo which is an excellent club.The wedding packages were rather expensive but we just contracted essential services to bring costs down. I was overall satisfied apart from few minor things. I paid for make up and hairstyling on wedding day but I still had to pay extra if I wanted hair trial ($42 per style) and make up trial. I think hair trial should be included as when a bride paid for make up and hair for wedding day. I didnt think I got the hairstyle that I wanted despite showing photos but fair play the hairstylist did work very hard.There was a little blip when it comes to music playlist during the wedding and reception (they dropped some songs I listed and added songs I didnt want) but i consider this to be minor irritation. i also got different bouquet flower on wedding day due to the windy weather on my weddding day.The wedding coordinator Diana was very helpful and certainly tries her best to coordinate everything and remaining calm. Photography was excellent and professional, I wished he would have taken more group shots though.There are shows every night, e.g. magic shows, circus show, fire dance, jazz band, pop band...sounds cheesy but they are actually quite entertaining.If you dont like alll that there is always the jacuzzi in the room! I had a mini jacuzzi party with my pals in my room trying to dry up the room's mini bar! It was fun.What can I say..top hotel in top location with top event and top service and top cuisine and mini bar.i would recommend this hotel for any discerning traveller.P/s The service like cleaning the room can be somewhat inconsistent ie late..but this is rare..ensure that reception/butler always aware.

Filip_Paseka|271B0DC7E0CE54E05F86E603E1CFEB00|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|4| “Good park”|review_464429484|We spent in the studio whole day and tried almost every single attraction, staff was very friendly and smiling whole day.We would recommend to not miss Mummy area, of course sci-fi attractions and despite the fact we are not fans of transformers, 3D drive there was simply the best.Unfortunately (big BUT), you can buy express pass which allows you to go to the special queue and you skip the line. At some attractions there were so many people with this pass that even they made queue and waiting time for normal people was incredibly long. We absolutely not agree with this mechanism and in our opinion it is not way which park should go. It is only making people mad and angry.Another point is that in Jurassic park you need to pay for locker (longer you use it, more money you pay), and together with many people with express pass you are just paying more for locker because they are skipping the queue (you wait more, pay more).If you would like to eat something, we definitely recommend Mel's bistro - great atmosphere with nice double burger.

Very thoughtfully designed theme park with well managed facilities. It was our lucky day that the weather was clear and each and every ride was operational, though we waited long in the ques it took almost 2 hours in few rides. But the rides in the park are exciting, Mummy Ride and Galactic are the best rides. I personally liked the Transformers Ride and the Shrek Show. Lots of food options, but little expensive, you can also carry your meal box. There are few shops just to take some memorable gifts and many attractive places to take superb pictures. A must visit place in Singapore.

But not the Best!!”|review_347067766|Everything is perfect about ITC Mughal Agra, except its "NOT-SO FRIENDLY" Staffs, from Front Desk till its Restaurants we found them a kind of moody, rude, and with a very unkind behaviour.For instance- The day we reached, we checked inn late so, we asked the front desk that can they provide us late check out just to make up our visit, the immediate response from the other side was straight face NO.Firstly, we know it is not a big deal. Secondly, we know you are a BIG HOTEL with 100% occupancy and all those glamour. But for the sake of courtesy your answer to any of your customer any time and every time what ever may be the matter should always be at least "WE WILL TRY", don't try since we are not begging you, but these quoted words will always leave a good impression. Similar behaviour we faced at your Peshwari Restaurant. Any ways, you are ITC, ITC MUGHAL and we are just another customer who stayed with you for the first and may be for the last time. But these small things do/may leave a mark on you and your brand.Good things about ITC MUGHAL- It is a well maintained property it is huge and beautiful.Food was awesome, quality wakes up the taste buds, we tried all of its restaurants and liked Taj Bano the most.Location is good with the great views of the Taj Mahal from the observation deck Jharokha-e-Taj.In all, ITC MUGHAL was not what we expected.

They first offer at 10.000 for each photos. Im not a fan of outdoor activities. So it's all just standard. The 4d cinema's chair is not working. Not suitable for too young children because its too dark and the sound system is too loud. Even louder than cinema. Movies are too boring.Underwater show quite fascinating. They have live mermaid. Sea lions show can fascinate children. Beware of mosquitoes. I didnt get to see the Dolphins show because its raining. Overall all of the attractions not under a good maintenance.

Lunch at Burangrang with a great view looking at the lake. Price expensive and food taste good. They served local food. Good for relaxing and they also have sofabed. Free kerupuk snacks at entrance. Rent the donut boat at the lake for 20k/pax. Great for relax. You can also dine at the restaurant at the lake. I don't know the details here. Rent the choo choo train for 30k/pax. Going up to Kampung Ulin using wara wiri car. Quite far if you walk and the road is not smooth for stroller and ascending. Prepare your legs if you decided to walk with stroller or children. I don't really like the attraction here. You can find lots avtivities here. Archery, angry bird, rodeo, and many more. But it's more like small kiosk for every attraction. Close at 5Tried the ATV. located at the farthest road at the end of the road. Paid 100k for the big ATV for 2. Great track and kinda scary. There's a sign warn that the there's a cliff and should be careful. Not recommended for young children. Going to difficult to find the wara wiri for going back. And because its going to past 5pm soon. We decided to walk back to the main area. Quite far and tiring while pushing the stroller. Overall its a worth visit leisure park.

Kinda difficult to find coz we don't see the sign. When get into the small road toward entrance, its very dark and there were 2 local citizens who said that they live there and sell souvenir standing in the middle of the road saying that everyone's who is going to enter their village road and visit cafe should buy it. Kinda insist and we just ignore them. Arrive at the cafe somehow i don't really like the ambience. Its very dark and spooky. My 2 yo boy saw spooky things and starting to calling someone that we can't even see. And maybe because its a weekday. Only 2 customers there. I don't recommend for young children to visit here. They don't have beautiful view like others famous cafe near Dago. I dont recommend here if you're looking for a view. For food taste good. What i tried and delicious are zuppa and bolognaise spaghetti. Not recommended Burundi chicken cordon. For price its expensive. Around 100k ++/pax.

You should visit here when you're in Jakarta. Should spare at least 1 whole day because the distance and the traffic jammed. It took around 2 hours from North Jakarta and can be as worse as 12 hours if jammed and high season. So make sure you come here on low season and check the one way schedule Quite expensive, you need to pay for the entrance, for vehicle and per pax. If I'm not mistaken, free for under 2. I forgot the price coz i visited last year. Once you paid, you can use every facilities inside, playground, shows, and attractions. Not well maintain, quite dirty for me, and the animals not groomed well. In my opinion they all looks skinny. Check schedule for their shows. Try to see all the shows. Worth it. One of the famous show is cowboy show. You can see penguins and feed them. But need an extra fee. For attractions, try the train that go into artificial cave. I forgot the attraction's name. Located across the elephant show. But be careful of you bring young children. When inside the cave, it's dark and there will be a sudden shot of fire. Might scared them but not harmful. None of the foods are delicious inside Taman Safari.

Stayed on the 16th floor in a twin bed room. Room* Spacious room that is larger than the norm in Melbourne* Modern clean and well presented* Desk well positioned in the room* Large windows with view of skyline* Bathroom was huge and had a touch of luxury - 2 basins, large bath with TV* Great amenities throughout the room (robes, bathroom accessories, slippers etc)* TV Has a good selection of channels and on demand movie offerings* Wifi was reliable* If there is any let down - water pressure in the shower was not great and the twin beds can move around. Bed and pillows probably not the most comfortable around.Dining* Large and varied in-room dining offering including a 24 hour menu* In room dining caters for all of the common dietary requirements and they are open to discussing dietary requests* The Radii restaurant was well laid out and has a lovely ambiance* Breakfast buffet had a lot of variety, a wood fired oven the chef uses for cooking hot items and plenty of bread, fruit, pastry and cereal items as well. Hotel grounds- The lobby and dining areas are large, spacious and full of character. The main entry areas are built to impress- Everything appears clean and well presented- The level 9 day spa has a huge gym, pool and change/shower facilities. If you have to check out and hang around in the hotel you can still take advantage of the day spay facilitiesService- Doormen were very helpful and deliver that welcoming service- Concierge were helpful, though at times were perhaps undermanned (1 person only) for such a large hotel- Abundant service in the restaurantLocation- 5 minutes to the nearest 7-Eleven which is on the end of Colin street- Probably 10-15 minutes walk to get to CBD shopping and dining hubThe hotel overall reminded me of some of the luxury hotels in Asia and the Middle east. Often hotels in Australia are understaffed and lacking luxuryRecommend this for leisure travelers and for business travelers who appreciate the extra luxury
SBPerth|98A603A5B53F6FE355A7D3016FEB1887|Hotel|Qantas|4| “Generally the most popular option for Perth to Melbourne”|review_496674034|In Australia if you want to fly with normal non-budget carriers, then Qantas is the top airline to choose. They generally have newer planes with more modern in flight entertainment and significantly better food offerings than virgin. Virgin has planes which are needing a refresh or replacement for a premium priced carrier. Qantas will generally have many more slots from Perth to Melbourne than Virgin so if you buy a flexible ticket you have more options if you need to change your flight. Main downside of Qantas is their planes are almost always full so you have long queues to get in and out of the plane and rarely will you find a spare seat next to you. (reflects their popularity)

Hotel is located on a scenic stretch of St Kilda Road. Details belowLocation* Overlooking a commercial part of St Kilda Road, on what is a very busy road during peak hours. Lots of workers during the day walking around. At night is very quiet with few people out and about* Good proximity to Alfred hospital if your staying nearby for medical reasons* Walking distance to tram station with easy 15-20 mins to Melbourne CBD* Nearby amenities are a 7-11 store, 20 min walk or short taxi to get to bigger grocery stores in Prahran* There is a restaurant in the hotel (more a bar than family restaurant), restaurant in the nearby Parkview and across the road near commercial road is a Burger Edge, Pizza, Japanese and Nandos . So you will have nearby options to get a meal* For those seeking more shopping or night life you have Prahran (Chappel road) or the city as choices. Uber / taxi range from 7.50 to 15 to get to the Prahran/Windsor area.Rooms (stayed in a studio room)* Clean and modern rooms. General hotel grounds look new. Comparing to say the Parkview nearby which looks decades apart.* Kitchenette comes with full size fridge, a cook-top, microwave, dishwasher and range of utensils to use. Guest laundry is on the ground floor.* Rooms have balconies but you would want to request forward facing rooms if you want to sit out and enjoy the view* TV has a mix of commercial and small selection of pay TV channels (including TVhits and sports, kids channels) Movie packages as well are available* Room service food menu is decent for after hours offerings compared to some Ive seen* Bathroom modern. There is not a lot of bathroom bench space as they go but shower has good flow and pressure* Pillows were not great, should have more of a selection of firmness types on offer by default* Air-conditioner kept the room toasty warm on cold Melbourne daysService* Housekeeping seemed ok* Concierge was very helpful when I had issues, top marks from me for them on that pointSummaryDecent hotel if you need to stay in that area. Pricing seems good as well. Could be a good modern but budget option close to the CBD without the CBD pricing. The studio rooms may be too small if you bring along kids, not sure what other offerings they may have for more than 2 people. If you don't like using car,taxi or tram you would perhaps look for a hotel with more immediate walking distance activities nearby.

Balconies on many rooms+ Spa bath which is rare to find in many hotels+ Bathroom heating which you dont see often - great for cold days+/- Breakfast was good, and good value and the eating area had a nice ambiance overlooking the nearby park but the breakfast staff service could be sharper and more welcoming+ concierge was helpful+ cleanliness seems good+ Sign up for their free rewards program gives some benefits like free WiFi and food discounts. A no-brainier to join.Not so good:- In general hotel has a dated feel - even walking in the lift you can see tiles are chipped on the floor and lots of scuff marks. This should be easy stuff to address so not sure why it hasnt been- Bathroom is very dated, flying saucers for tap faucets. - Room Lacks some of the automatic amenities like free water, slippers, bathrobes you find standard in rooms nearby CBD hotels- Bathroom soaps feel cheap- Room service is limited after 9:30pm to only pizza, keep in mind if you fly in late. Hotel is due a refurbish and refresh.

For someone attending a conference there it is great. For someone attending for recreation there may be better located hotels to consider.Hotel Grounds+ Clean grounds and hallways, and ample seating areas+ ATMs, mini-shop and adjoining coffee shop inside+ Small but functional gymService+ In dining room service were prompt and helpful+/- Various concierges I dealt with were are generally helpful, though issues raised about the room were not, followed up on- Lack of warm welcome at the door that a good hotel is renowned for. The head breakfast guy was very welcoming - would be a good example to follow.Room OverviewStayed on the 3rd level room with 2 double beds. + Two Double beds suitable for a couple with kids+ Reasonably spacious and room was clean and well presented+ Bathroom was in good condition and well stocked with towels and amenties+ Nice lighting options for creating your desired ambiance at night- All of the pillows provided were lacking firmness- Terrible view on the 3rd level overlooking a closed (and ugly) foyer/pool area. Being a week there, this was a major downside. Created a darker room due to foyer obscuring natural light. You may want to request a higher floor if your staying more than a day- Planes landing at San Jose can often be heard as they fly directly overhead- Step in bath rather than walk in shower which I prefer & bath faucet leaked during the stay so was something you could hear in the background. Also had shower curtain which you don't see in top chains. (water leaks everywhere without it)- A noisy pump or other machine woke me up a couple times in the middle of the night. No resolution when this was raised with hotel staff. Again may be a 3rd floor issue.In room entertainment+ Good quality WiFi - worked well- TV had very limited options. The selection of local channels was bland and no easy guides available on the TV to see what is on.- On demand movies are very expensive 20-25+ USD for a single movie. This is way overpriced and no package offers- With this hotel being in a very dead/sterile location it should consider putting in NetFlix or other dedicated movie channels to pass the time in the evening(for free)Location+ If you are attending a conference at the San Jose conference center this is basically connected next door. + Close to the San Jose airport+ Train on road alongside of the hotel- Very little to see or do immediately outside the hotel and very little in the way of walking distance attractions, restaurants and shops. Expect to use a train, taxi or Uber to go anywhere. - Major shopping areas are 15+ minutes by car awayThere are a few other hotels nearby that would also likely suffer from the commercial nature of the area (and lack of activities). There is nothing going on around. At night it seems very quiet.If you do not need to specifically stay in San Jose you may want look at what other hotel options are available at San Francisco or nearby cities.

Stayed in a room on level 5 overlooking the entry parkRoom overview+ First thing you notice is a huge window with a lovely view of the city and park+ During the day this makes the room light and airy (with curtains open)+ Desk with power points etc if you need to work+ Small balcony with 2 chairs and a table that would be a lovely place to sit and have a drink and watch the city+ comfortable bed and a pillow menu to request different pillows+ TV was not the biggest Ive seen but a good range of TV and movie options+ Easy to use air-con controls and sufficient lighting options+ Bathroom was well appointed and spaciousSome downsides:- Would comment that the shower head was small for the shower and didn't have the spray coverage I normally see- No complimentary water that most upmarket hotels are offering these days. You can get 2 bottles for $6 which is a good price. If you get the room at a good price its probably ok.Hotel Overview+ Whilst I didn't use it seems to have a high quality pool, spa , gym. Open to 11pm is very good many other hotels close earlier+ Central CBD location. Walking distance to Rundle mall+ Some nice restaurants and coffee shops in the immediate vicinity+ The park out front is nice for a walk around+ Clean and modern hallways , connecting areas- The entry foyer looks a bit bland/industrial and could use a minor touch of decoration/colour/textures to warm up the entry- nearby convenience stores are a bit of walk away if you want to get something late at night. Admittedly staff seemed helpful if something is needed though+/- lower levels may have more outside noise. Its a bit of a trade-off as you get an awesome window and balcony areaServiceOverall in a very short stay staff seemed more helpful than at a more expensive hotel I've stayed in the Adelaide CBD+ Porter/entry staff seemed genuinely helpful+ Efficient front desk+ Warm hello with a smile by cleaning staff as you pass the corridorSummaryRelative to the price paid for this visit, was generally very impressed with the room. Location is good, Service seems sharp and there are decent amenities on offer. I would certainly visit again and recommend Crowne Adelaide. If your getting low pricing below $160 per night its a bargain.

Multiple themed areas with rides for big and smaller kids. If you are a tourist only there for the single day the express pass would probably get you around quicker as some of the attractions can have 1-2 hour waits to get on.For myself the Transformers ride was the highlight, kids loved the junior rollercoster and the Madagascar boat rides.There are a variety of food offerings in the park, bit overpriced and from our experience not great.Some of the cloth shopping we saw (e.g. Universal shirts) were cheaper than you would expect.

The animals are closer up than is the case at other zoos and there are some daily shows which can be entertaining to watch.There is a free water playground in the zoo, whilst not super big was a favourite for our kids to play in. Bring bathers for your kids, though not really for adults.Food choices were a bit limited, fast food and Asian options. Getting into the zoo does not get you the River and night safaris. Whilst I never went to those, it seems a bit like your being double charged for the same location.

More choices of western food and in general more food variety than Orchard road shopping centers I visited. (that catered almost exclusively to Asian tastes) Whilst there is still lots of overpriced luxury stores there was some good shopping - a huge Toy's R US , Tangs and other mid-tier brand name stores. e.g SketchersFrom the shopping center Level 3 you can take the Monorail to Sentosa Island so its a good location to start your trip in Singapore at.

Most of the shopping would be categorised as high priced luxury - not much for the bargain hunter looking for affordable quality. Places like Kuala Lumpar are a more affordable option to visit. Many of the shopping centers have a confusing layout and limited signage as where you are and what is available.Food is almost extensively Asian, not as many Western outlets

I went with the free options which was visiting the area with evening light show and treetop walk.

Good affordable option for families with smaller kids. (considering Singapore is a pretty expensive Asian destination as they go)Location Notes+ Central to the Orchard road shopping precinct. Easy walk to Orchard Gateway, Orchard Central, 313 in particular+ Walking distance to the MRT railway which we found a great way to get around many places in Singapore (You dont need taxi unless your going further away like the Zoo)+ Catch the MRT at Somerset (near hotel) and head to Vivo City for Monorail to Sentosa (Universal, Waterpark etc..)- Next to Cuppage plaza which as well as a bit of an eyesore but has some popular value restaurants. Gets a bit sketchy at nightRoom+ Two double beds which avoid the need to get two rooms. + Bathroom reasonably modern and functional though a little on the small side+ TV has a channel "Singapore insider" which was a good way to see the places to visit in Singapore. Liked that feature. + TV has dedicated kids channel which gives them something to watch+ Lots of complementary water- TV channels not much in the way of movies etc.. - Room is a bit small (with 2 double beds), OK for family with smaller kids. If your going with Teenagers may be better to find a double suite- We were on the 8th floor on the Orchard Road side and you could hear the hum of something constantly running - possibly the pool pump. You ignore it after a while but if your light or difficult sleeper you may want to ask for room on a lower level or on the Entrance side- You wont get swept away by the views, on the Orchard road side the view is not great (see photos). There is a lot to do so you probably wont be in the room much anyway. ServiceIn general the hotel service lefta good impression.+ Concierge staff helpful and professional+ Porters were also helpful and professional+ We ordered room service and it was reasonably prompt and they made the effort to follow up to see if we were happy+ Breakfast service was good++ Was highly impressed by the room cleaning service. Normally I don't notice much difference between hotel to hotel but at the Holiday Inn those ladies really take pride in their job and it showed. (Like laying out the kids dolls in a nice way which my kids loved). Dining - BreakfastAsk for a deal on breakfast when you check in. Kids under 12? can eat breakfast free+ Big buffet with lots of choice. Have separate halal and non-halal sections as well as vegetarian options (so covers three main food preferences in Singapore)+ They have a kids corner with flavored milk, kids cereals, mini-cupcakes, Swiss rolls etc.. A fun addition for smaller kidsOverall was a good family hotel, I certainly can recommend this hotel for people looking for a good value hotel in a central location with decent service. Kids friendly choice as well.

General Notes+ Centrally located on Collins street. Hear of CBD+ close to major malls and restaurants - walking distance to a lot of stuff+ close to public transport+ reasonably quiet area after hours + 24 convenience store across the road+ comfortable, well appointed room+ concierge desk were helpful + well appointed bathroom+ mezzanine area provides free drinks and snacks - unique in terms of countless hotels I've visited (that I can remember). So if you check out and you need to kill time they can allow you to stay in the mezzanine area which is very comfortable- downside for my preference, step in bath/shower rather than walk in (preferred)- Room Service only every 3 days - little in the way of complimentary offerings - e.g. No bottled water which many places provideFrom a business view+ Quiet+ central CBD location+ complimentary area has free drinks and food - plus quiet for meetings (though needs some power points for laptops etc)- Small desk and poorly positioned (squeezed in a small area of the total room)- lack of power points (have to move furniture to plug in a device)- WiFi was flaky (for me and a colleague in another room)Family viewpoint+ bonus small kitchen, empty fridge, cutlery, plates etc..+ Step in bath with plastic ducks - small kids would love it.+ Microwave, stove - good for preparing food, heating food for babies etc+ TV can spin around to lounge area and back to bed area (so can have kids watching TV on the lounge)+ Netflix has dedicated kids programming+ lots of storage area for longer stays- can trip down the stairs would be a problem for a young toddler who cant walk wellGeneral opinion, good hotel like accommodation. The room I was in probably more suited to a family or couple rather than for business trips. I hear there are better rooms with balconies etc.. cant comment on those.

Main attraction would be central location for visiting places like Rundle Mall and comfortable rooms.Room* Comfortable bed, lots of choices of pillows. Room was spacious and multiple lighting options to creat a nice ambience* One of the largest big screen TVs I have seen in a hotel with some Foxtel channels available* Bathroom newly renovated and spacious* All the key amenities you typically need* Not much in the way of views, smaller windows as part of the historical character of the building* 24 hour room service on offer which is better than a lot of Australian hotels I have stayed atMain areas and locations* Small Foyer area, being a renovated historical building it does not have the beautiful foyer of purpose built hotels. * Lifts are generally quick and responsive (and a good number of them)* Main breakfast restaurant is located in a basement area, functional but lacking atmosphere* Across the road from Rundle Mall so very central for walking to shopping and restaurants , perfect for short stopovers.* Tram access also across the road to further aid getting around* Taxi bays were often filled with other cars in front of the hotel so took a bit of a wait to get a taxi without booking. Services* Breakfast buffet has decent options including some gourmet bircher muesli, freshly squeezed juices and pastries. Barista made coffee was well done. * Main concierge desk was sometimes short manned, should have 2 people available for checkout / check-in at all times based on my experience at similar class hotels in Australia. (Melbourne, Sydney)Overall positive experience, good location
SBPerth|98A603A5B53F6FE355A7D3016FEB1887|Hotel|Sarajevo: Hotel Central Sarajevo|5| “Luxury Sarajevo Hotel & Top Location”|review_405132180|Highly recommended for the luxury hotel visitor. Whilst this hotel is rated 3 star I found many elements better than 4 star hotels I have stayed at. The Location:* The hotel is close to the "old town" area of Sarajevo so perfect if your there on holiday* Located straight from the old church it is basically in between the old and new areas. Left takes you towards modern shops and right towards the old town* Many of the main attractions (Old Mosques, Churches, Old Markets) are a short walk away and taxis wont be needed* A 24 hour grocery store (Konzum) is located across from the hotel for any supplies you may need which was very handy* Plenty of night activities nearby (restaurants etc..)* Long term Parking is nearby the hotel for those travelling by Car (the hotel can also provide parking with notice)The Hotel* Lovely foyer and entry area. Lots of comfortable seating* Restaurant area has relaxing ambiance to have a coffee or some food* Breakfast has large choice of continental offerings made to order in the restaurant. Some nice healthier options (e.g. Smoothies).* Quality pool - kids loved it* From what I saw a well appointed Gym with lots of equipment* Helpful staffThe Rooms* Having stayed in a lot of hotels I can say the room was larger than the norm - loved it.* Comfortable beds and amenities* TV with lots of cable channels (many in English including kids channels) * Beautiful bathrooms with good amenities (better than many 4 star hotels I've stayed at)If I visit Sarajevo again this is my hotel of choice. For the experience I had, cant fault it. Especially recommend if you are travelling with young kids as rooms are spacious, comfortable and quiet.

Workman like foyer. Quick checkout. Location - close to airport though from domestic if coming in late you need to take a short taxi hop. Not a location for a stopover holiday or extended visit.Room - Small but modern. Bathroom has a very nice shower and is modern. Lacking privacy though if you have kids. (open design) I had a lower room and its a terrible view of the car-park. Again if your there on business short stop or overnight-er it wont be a concernFood - Breakfast was well done. Nice buffet, well appointed.Not a holiday holiday , otherwise does the job

In the restaurant staff are attentive and helpful.Food - Loved the breakfast, the hotel restaurant has a beautiful relaxing vibe to it and you feel your in a really classy place. Food options were very good and of a high quality. The pastries in particular were awesome. Room - Room was good, on a lower level so nothing to see outside. (blocked by other rooms). Bathroom maybe a bit dated but it was serviceable. Comfortable bedLocation - right in the CBD on the more commercial side. 10-15 mins walk to Burke Street mall and similar. Quiet location at night.Price premium over other choices in Melbourne but its a quality stay. If you sign up for their reward program its a 2pm checkout.

Like anyplace it has the standard continental options but I particularly liked some of the vegetarian options available - recommend the porridge which is tasty and quite the difference to normal breakfast options. (you don't feel like you had a big fatty meal before a meeting) Well priced.Liked the ambiance of the place, overlooking flagstaff park.
SBPerth|98A603A5B53F6FE355A7D3016FEB1887|Hotel|Melbourne: Radisson on Flagstaff Gardens|4| “Decent value hotel in CBD”|review_350665429|Slightly cheaper option in the CBD compared to some comparable hotels in Melbourne. Stayed in a corner room which was quiet and roomy. Across the road is Flagstaff park which is a pretty pack full of people walking, relaxing etc.. Good if you like to go for a jog/walk.Room - spacious with all of the normal amenities, comfortable beds. A selection of foxtel channels on the TV. (a few more would be good). Main downside for me was the shower which was a bath/shower you have to step into which also has unusual and difficult reach/use tap fittings. Didn't like it at all and is poorer shower than the last 3 hotels (Syd, Melb) that I visited. There is a moving glass panel I didn't like. Definite risk of falling , injury. But if you have young kids you like to bath it would be good.Food - breakfast is cheaper than some hotels in the CBD. The hot selection seems to cater for typical tastes but cold could do with some more options like bircher muesli. Also pastry selection was not well done - too small and tough. Whilst I never ate lunch/dinner there they seemed to have specials for $15 for lunches which is good in a hotelService - you are not really greeted at the door or anything or any help with bags. Room service seemed responsive. Didn't like the fact in the restaurant you make your own tea for breakfast - my previous hotel in the Melbourne CBD had a much sharper service in this area. Location - I was on business so proximity to train station was good - get get around the CBD and surrounding suburbs really easily. You have to go for a walk (15 mins) to Melbourne Central and surrounding areas if you want to shop, go to restaurants or visit the cinema. (train is an option though) There's not much on the doorstep from a shopping point of view. The Queen Victoria markets are close but if your on a business trip the closing hours are earlier than you will probably return from your appointments (4pm). Would I stay again, probably. If your looking for good value then this is probably one of the better choices. If you want luxury/pampering this one probably misses the mark but then you are getting it for cheaper than some.

It ticks all of the boxes if your with a lover of shopping , eating out. Location Notes* close to times Square (5 mins. walk) which has a lot of food options, affordable shopping and a theme-park (level 5) which has rides for both old (roller-coaster etc) and young kids (toddlers). Your kids will love this place and you can get some nice shopping in to. Cheap ticket entry and you can leave and come back in on the same day without paying again.* Close to grocery outlets for things you need to buy* Next door is the Lot 10 shopping centre which has the Isetan department store and other smaller stores. (We got some bargains on name brands here compared to Australia) Good prices on things such as clothes , shoes, watches etc..* Next to that is Fahrenheit 88 with another 3-4 levels of shopping and H&N department store. * Across the road is Sungai Wei plaza. Bit of a maze , lower quality goods but like 2 mins from the hotel. Behind that are 2 other shops, you need to be a detective to find them though.* Further away you have the Pavilion Mall (with high class shopping, themed shopping, high class and regular restaurants. The bottom floor food court is awesome.)* Cinemas in both Times Square and Pavilion * Food in the area is mostly of good quality and clean, no need to eat in the restaurant at the hotel if you want to eat on a budget.* If you are into shopping and eating out you do not need a taxi. Everything you need is in walking distance. Security guards, lighting etc. so it feels safe and is quite clean and full of atmosphere. Kids went with us everywhere , no problems.Hotel Good points:* Reasonably priced* Staff friendly especially to kids* Service when requesting something is generally good* rooms have all the necessities (iron, hairdryer, convertible power switches etc..). * Breakfast buffet was generally good. nice range to suit most. * room service food is reasonably priced (compared to AU ) but is of course more expensive than local options. Lots of choice.* Got free Wifi in the room which was good. (check your package/offering though)* Pool and gym are nice.Hotel - Not so good:* rooms were not ready at the check-in time. Considering check-in is 2.00pm that's pretty poor* room cleaning seems slower than other hotels I have stayed at, we had on first day someone knocking on door at 4pm to clean up which to me is not on. Most people go out in the morning which is when cleaning should be done. it did get better on the remaining days.* i was at 10th floor, one night got woken up by alarms / sirens down on the street. Road noise can be heard. Generally though we had no problems.* TV is terrible. Same movies, series rotated 4-5 times over a few days. (I saw Sleepover 3-4 times, Click 2-3 times etc..) Offering some pay-per view movies would be good way to improve it.Overall a good value hotel, decent service, great location.

It's just awesome. BUT the hotel rooms & corridors need a complete overhaul. The two rooms we booked smelt of dampness. The wallpaper had signs of water damages (they were buckling!!!). The carpet - dirty. The walls were plain dirty. The rooms were on the small side. There are no room service. Need extra towels? Go get them yourself. No porter/bell-boy. Carry your own luggage. Tough it up. Thank God the 16th floor where I was did not smell as bad as the 10th floor where I went to the coin-laundry room. Practically had to hold your breath as you walked there. Smelt like old bar!?! Regarding the coin laundry, after travelling for a while around Asia, I was looking forward to washing my clothes at a reasonable price. Unfortunately, there is only 1 washing machine out of 3 & 1 dryer that work!! Guests take out other people's clothes out of the machines so that they can use it!! Fix them already. 10 days I was there & the situation remained the same. It should be noted however that the reception & restaurant areas were up-to-date & clean. I wish the rest of the hotel were the same. Still, I have to thank the beautiful staff we met there. The front desk, the concierge, the F&B personnel as well as the sweet lady who did the cleaning on our floor. Top notch for communication & service. They were most helpful particularly with organising the shipping of 6 boxes for us. Thank you. I really just pray that the Accor Group upgrades that particular hotel to bring it to par to the location and the staff. Thank you to the Ibis Ambassador team.
Pam G|443662914BD0E26107774DB12FD5E2D1|Attractions|Seoul: Seoul Metro|5| “Excellent ”|review_503680945|Excellent public transport system. We spent 10 days going around Seoul using only their metro system. You first have to buy a Y-money card (transit card, the equivalent of the Melbourne mykey card, English Oyster card, Hong Kong Octopus card). It costs 5000 won. We initially put 10000 won on each card. We refilled our cards 2 twice with top ups of 10000 won each time. I reckon it's good value compared to many other international cities like Paris for example. There are clear maps in every stations. Also, both in the stations & trains, all announcements are done in Korean and English. While travelling, when approaching each station, the announcements are done in English & Korean + they also tell you which side to go exit. Very good user friendly system. Very clean. Very punctual & fast. No long waiting periods.

I love Korean food, particularly Korean BBQ & tonight we thought we'd try G2 in Melbourne CBD. Well, the tables are dirty. They are so sticky & grimy. The exhausts don't work. The music is so EXTREMELY loud that we could not hear each other talk let alone the waitress who took our order after 3 repeats. The service was so bad that the waitress put our food on the seat next to us because there was not much room on the table. The cost was quite expensive for all that horror. I walked out in the middle of the meal. Never set foot again there that's for sure

The weather was not good. No food available. Went back to ship early as were hungry. Otherwise, I hear there usually are people grilling lobsters to sell. Pity for me I guess that the gods had decided to rain on my parade on that day. I believe there Should be something available at all times. The 'ramparts' are broken & don't look like they're going to be repaired soon. Massive pines have fallen and are leaning against each other. These are accidents waiting to happen. The whole place looks like a beautiful abandoned gem. How sad. Typical of French territories I guess.

But when you total: coach & boat transfers, buffet lunch, pre lunch alcoholic drinks & wine during lunch, tea & coffee, glass bottom boat, reef trip on another boat plus entertainment, it is actually pretty good. The beach was lovely. The water was however cold at the time I went. Also being winter, there were plenty of snakes on the sea and on the island. They freaked me out. I'd seen them before in Fiji, the size of pencil but on Amedee, they were as long as my arm & quite big. But that's nature. Nothing can be done about that. I loved seeing 2 see turtles.

What a misnomer!After reviewing all the great recommendations from past guests from that resort we went there to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. We travel very regularly throughout Europe, Mauritius and this is actually our 20th visit to Fiji according to Fiji customs on the way out. So this review is one of the hardest I find myself making. Accommodation: we booked the 1 bedroom villa on the beach. It looked as spectacular as in the pictures on the net. Nothing to fault with the look. Just amazing. But the outdoor bathroom, even though it looks just stunning it was in the picture it is SO impractical. It is completely outdoor. My fault; when they said 'outdoor shower', I wrongly assumed that it would be semi-outdoor; that it could never be completely outdoor in the tropics. Well it is. We had a nest of wasps (they called them hornets) in the gutter in our bathroom as well as 3 wasps cocoons being built on the posts in our bathroom. Imagine the amount of wasps flying around practically all the time. The mosquitoes at night. The flies every time we emptied our bowels!! I even had a yellow & brown coloured spider visiting me while I was showering! It was most unpleasant. On our last night, we even had a cockroach that fell on my husband as he opened the door to go out to the bathroom (I have photos after he killed it as proof, however I think it's gross to upload that). Now let's talk about the weather in the bathroom. It rained, showered, it was windy, it was cool at night. We did not feel we were at a resort but as if we were camping somewhere being at the hands of the temperament of nature before having a shower. Who on earth designed such idiocy? At least give the guests an option by also having an indoor shower. Close the outdoor area with glass or something so that guests are not forced to be victims of such situations. I suffer from a lung condition and I feared the effects of the cool breeze on my health every night when showering. It's just wrong. The Windows or lack of: The rooms have plenty of plantation shutters but no windows. Unfortunately due to the high winds that seem to blow constantly, the howling or screeching sound they make at night stopped me from sleeping. Again, who's that idiot who designed that? Maybe he/she should spend one night trying to sleep with the wind screeching through the shutters all night long & we'll see how fast those stupid designs are abandoned. Get windows in those rooms pronto. Also, sand blows in. Ask the cleaners. The bites in the room: as of the second night, my husband & I became food to some sort of bites while sleeping. We complained after the first morning it happened & a whole team of cleaners came to our room to thoroughly clean everything as they could see the bites on us, particularly on me. I had not gone in the sea, so it could not be sea lice or anything like that. The second night, we were bitten again. The third night, we sprayed ourselves before going to bed & woke up without any new bites.No authentic Fiji look:Lack of Fijian look with the roof that we are so used to seeing around in Fiji. It was so apparent as we approached by air. However we understand, because the high winds would most likely blow everything away very quickly. The restaurant, menu & food: The restaurant looked very nice & I really appreciated the fact that there was plenty of space between the tables so that you got some privacy.The menu choice was quite poor.Breakfast: supposed buffet & à la carte hot food. The choice at the buffet is very limited. We finally got croissants on our 4th morning; no yoghurt; no cheese (had to ask) ; no cold meat. The coffee choice was only a coffee pot; we had to pay for our expressos even after we were told by a waitress whose name can be provided if asked that espressos were included in the breakfasts. At least have a coffee machine like many resorts do nowadays (eg Sofitel Resort & Spa Denarau).Lunch: Choice is again very limited but ok. Dinner: To start with, there is not enough light for us to read our menu. They must see nearly every guests with their phone lights on to read to menu. What does that mean? There's not enough light. Do something about it. It's ridiculous. Menu choice & quantity:Same choice 2 days in a row with only 4 choices per course is quite poor. The quantity served is unbelievable. For the first time in my life, I had to tell the waiter that my main was just not enough. I ordered the local fish with purée of 3 different vegetables & I got 2 VERY TINY pieces of fish & a few DOTS around my plates. It looked even too small for a usual entrée. I had to state my amazement & shock. The waiter brought me another serve & Only then was I able to be satisfied. The whole episode made me feel like a glutton but I should not. It was just ridiculous. As mentioned above, we are well travelled & this was a first. Whenever in Fiji, if able, we dine at V restaurant at Sofitel. It is haute cuisine & by God, the food is just amazing & so is the quantity. Maybe the chef at Paradise Cove resort could just pop over there for a little chat & advice.The lack of path lights:Thank God for my phone light that allowed us to move from our villa to the restaurant & back every night. It is pitch black. The hotel puts one tiny tea candle light in a lantern every now & then supposedly to light guests' paths!! However every guests use their phone light. Maybe the hotel should think why that is so. The paths:The paths leading from the rooms to the restaurant & pool are non existent. It is a struggle to walk back & forth while sinking in the sand. All of the resorts we have stayed in Fiji since 1996 are on islands & they all have hardened the paths somehow, making it easier for their guests to move about. The sand, wind & beach. We have learnt too late that the winds blow strongly on that resort affecting the beach, the sea and guests comfort generally. The photos of beach on the net for this resort are deceptive. There are corals, broken shells everywhere. They are so sharp that it makes it impossible to walk on the beach or even go in the water. On our second afternoon, there were 5 staff members with huge bags collecting the bigger corals that had washed up. But it did not change anything. Guests stayed away from the beach. It was unpleasant. Another reason that made it so was the wind. We can't go on the beach for fear of being whipped by flying sand. Believe me, it hurts. The sea is so rough all the time that we just did not dare go into the sea. The whole time we were there, we saw just 2 people twice (on the first & on the 4 day) in the sea & they lasted not even 5 minutes!! On our last day, we saw a young couple of honeymooners attempting to go into the sea & giving up after standing in the water for approximately 30 seconds. So sad to see. The pool: Just a plain rectangular pool. Nothing to write home about. However, knowing how bad the sea is in front of the resort, those hotel designers could have put some more thoughts into designing a nicer pool. The people: As usual, everyone is Fiji is always absolutely lovely. A special thank you to Mika for trying to make our second honeymoon somewhat better. He was most attentive to us & even organised a special song for our anniversary as well as a special celebratory dessert (see photo). I have to say how quick they were to respond to our call to fix our roof that banged all night due to high winds on our second night. Another one came each time we called to fix the tv that would not connect for 2 days. Another team came to change our phone when they realised that lines were crossing. All we knew is that they kept on calling asking for another room. Vinaka vakalevu to all the Fijians at Paradise Cove. Just beautiful people. Overall: What a disappointment! What a misnomer! Nothing paradisal about this place. We will never go back there. We hope to meet the lovely workers again but in another resort. God willing, we will go back to beautiful Fiji but never to that particular resort.
Pam G|443662914BD0E26107774DB12FD5E2D1|Restaurant|Nadi: Cafe O Fiji|5| “Excellent ”|review_359931631|After a horrible experience of being served off milk at Raffles Gateway Hotel, Nadi, we were desperate for a decent breakfast. Our taxi driver recommended it. It was extremely clean, air conditioned, beautiful service, the choice for breakfast was quite big and the cost was very reasonable. The coffees were good and came very promptly. The quality of the food that came was beyond reproach. The quantity was very good for two hungry people. I saw some lovely freshly baked cakes and cookies being brought as we were finishing our breakfast. I would highly recommend this cafe to all.
Pam G|443662914BD0E26107774DB12FD5E2D1|Hotel|Nadi: Fiji Gateway Hotel|1| “Horror”|review_359930533|We were sent there to wait for our sea plane connection as we landed quite early in the day. We planned to have breakfast while waiting. The continental breakfast choice was very poor. The worst was when I asked for skim or low fat milk to have with my cereals, I was initially told they did not know what I was talking about, followed by they did not have any. When I told them that I was allergic to full cream milk, suddenly they knew what I was talking about and went looking for some at the bar. Unfortunately what they brought me was off. When I put a spoonful of it with my cereal in my mouth, I could not help spitting it right out. When I told them that the milk was off, they looked at me as if I was talking a foreign language. What a horrible experience. The horrible taste stayed in my mouth for hours. Please do not go there for stop overs or anything else. Hotels at Denarau are only 12kms away from the airport, we usually take around 20 minutes to get there. If you need a good breakfast just around the corner from the airport just go to Cafe O, maximum 10 minutes from the airport in heavy traffic.

Pam G|443662914BD0E26107774DB12FD5E2D1|Hotel|Denarau Island: Sofitel Fiji Resort & Spa|2| “Too noisy & disappointing ”|review_344864045|This was our 5th visit there. We obviously liked it that's why we went back. But after this visit we are going to think long & hard before going back. If ever. Out of 5 nights there, we were woken up 4 mornings between 7:30am to 8:00am by staff hammering, pulling heaving stuff & God knows what else waking us up while we are on holidays. I understand that work has to be done but that early & that loud?! Tourists pay a lot to come relax & sleeping in is part of it.We had to call the front desk every day & I even spoke to the duty manager about it. Once should have been more than enough. It never stopped. Our complaints never stopped. Well I'm putting it in writing now. Pity. Another matter: we arrived at the hotel at 12:30pm, I admit prior to check-in time which is 2:00pm. We booked two connecting rooms. I got one around 3:30pm and did not get the second one until 5:30 pm. Every time I called to ask about the second room, I was told that someone was going to call me back straight away which they never did. That went on for two hours. Every time I went to the front desk to see what was going on, they kept on giving me free drink vouchers. I did not want free drink vouchers, I wanted my room. Such lack of service & such disregard from a 5star hotel is disappointing. We are Accor Le Club members & I have to admit that our last stay at the Sofitel Fiji Spa Resort was bad. Maybe if they need repairs done they should think of closing it down for renovations. We travel often to Mauritius & I often see 5star resorts closed down temporarily for that reason. Also, a page from there too, maintenance & cleaning work do not start until breakfast has finished which is after 11:00am. Regarding the turn down service, it should be done during dinner time while patrons are at dinner, fresh towels should given, beds turned down etc. No one should walk in on people while they are naked getting ready for dinner which happened to us twice. We had to put the do not disturb sign on & we were told they do not supply fresh towels! Maybe take a look at what other 5 star resorts do around the world & learn. Oh, I nearly forgot the lack of pool lounges & the dangerous umbrellas. Twice they fell on us & we witnessed about 10 falling around us. One fell on a pram, thank God the baby was in the mother's arms at that time. After that we decided to go to the beach for fear of getting hurt. They never used to have such poor quality ones. What's going there?! The wind was not that strong to cause them to fall so much. Get better ones, get rid of those flimsy ones. Real pity.

We have had a most memorable and happy time there. Thank you to every staff on the island. We were welcomed by all, from top to bottom. Vinaka vakalevu.

Tour guide: Helen, driver: Francois. Both very good. Helen was most informative, patient & very nice. She was most accommodating. Farewelled the group at Mont St Michel to go back to Paris & joined another bus, 2 tour guides & 2 drivers. Drama at the start: they gave the impression that there were at least 6 people missing, so we had to wait a while until they got the ok from the office to leave. Shortly after takeoff, I understood that they did not count properly & that there was no one missing! Wasted everyone's time. Into the trip now & Laura is actually lying, feet on the seats in front of me, reading a book!!! Not a word has been said. It looks like the tour is finished. Disappointing & unprofessional attitude. 2 hours into the trip back to Paris, getting back onto the bus after a pit stop, Natty announced that the people that were supposedly missing never were but we're in fact on the bus in front of us. They chatted between themselves ignoring everyone one else on the bus. Other people grumbled about their attitudes during the pit stop. In the meantime, we're running 45 minutes late. I've had to cancel a car that were to pick us up at Paris City tours office around 9:00pm, the scheduled drop off time. We're now facing public transport in a strange city at night thanks to 2 incompetent tour guides. O my gosh, I was sleeping on the way to Paris & was just jostled out of my sleep by the driver named Marc (seated behind me) who had decided to listen loudly to the radio , some horse racing thing. This trip is still going downhill. As a compensation, they should have at least offered taxi fares for everyone to their hotels or other destinations. Laura, Natty, Fernando & Marc On the other side of the river around Musee d'orsay. Camion coincé dans le tunnel et le chauffeur a dit putain au moins trois fois en rainy avec toute l'équipe!!

It's just awesome. BUT the hotel rooms & corridors need a complete overhaul. The two rooms we booked smelt of dampness. The wallpaper had signs of water damages (they were buckling!!!). The carpet - dirty. The walls were plain dirty. The rooms were on the small side. There are no room service. Need extra towels? Go get them yourself. No porter/bell-boy. Carry your own luggage. Tough it up. Thank God the 16th floor where I was did not smell as bad as the 10th floor where I went to the coin-laundry room. Practically had to hold your breath as you walked there. Smelt like old bar!?! Regarding the coin laundry, after travelling for a while around Asia, I was looking forward to washing my clothes at a reasonable price. Unfortunately, there is only 1 washing machine out of 3 & 1 dryer that work!! Guests take out other people's clothes out of the machines so that they can use it!! Fix them already. 10 days I was there & the situation remained the same. It should be noted however that the reception & restaurant areas were up-to-date & clean. I wish the rest of the hotel were the same. Still, I have to thank the beautiful staff we met there. The front desk, the concierge, the F&B personnel as well as the sweet lady who did the cleaning on our floor. Top notch for communication & service. They were most helpful particularly with organising the shipping of 6 boxes for us. Thank you. I really just pray that the Accor Group upgrades that particular hotel to bring it to par to the location and the staff. Thank you to the Ibis Ambassador team.

We spent 10 days going around Seoul using only their metro system. You first have to buy a Y-money card (transit card, the equivalent of the Melbourne mykey card, English Oyster card, Hong Kong Octopus card). It costs 5000 won. We initially put 10000 won on each card. We refilled our cards 2 twice with top ups of 10000 won each time. I reckon it's good value compared to many other international cities like Paris for example. There are clear maps in every stations. Also, both in the stations & trains, all announcements are done in Korean and English. While travelling, when approaching each station, the announcements are done in English & Korean + they also tell you which side to go exit. Very good user friendly system. Very clean. Very punctual & fast. No long waiting periods.

But when you total: coach & boat transfers, buffet lunch, pre lunch alcoholic drinks & wine during lunch, tea & coffee, glass bottom boat, reef trip on another boat plus entertainment, it is actually pretty good. The beach was lovely. The water was however cold at the time I went. Also being winter, there were plenty of snakes on the sea and on the island. They freaked me out. I'd seen them before in Fiji, the size of pencil but on Amedee, they were as long as my arm & quite big. But that's nature. Nothing can be done about that. I loved seeing 2 see turtles. Overall, a lovely day.
Pam G|443662914BD0E26107774DB12FD5E2D1|Attractions|Aneityum Island: Mystery Island|2| “Ordinary”|review_392679620|Stopover for the day with a cruise. It was dull. Nothing much to do. One side of the island the the beach is windy & full of corals whereas the other side is FULL of sea cucumbers. Neither is pleasant. The locals are there just to sell their wares. No entertainment. Only food was some sort of donut on a stick & a few takeaway tubs of fish & rice concoctions that the locals bought before the tourists had the chance to. Basically, not worth it.
Pam G|443662914BD0E26107774DB12FD5E2D1|Restaurant|Tullamarine: McDonald's|1| “Service nonexistent ”|review_390602195|Stopped there on the way home this afternoon. Wanted a small thing to tie us until dinner. Ordered a toasted banana bread through drive-thru. Waited 13 minutes. Nothing. Drove around to the window & cancelled our order as we were sick of waiting. The 'manager' came around to do the refund. Not one word of apology for the wait. Nothing. She took another 4 minutes to process the refund. Whatever happened to service?! I thought Maccas training were pretty good on that sort of thing. Maybe in some suburbs. It certainly skipped that one. In the end, we wasted nearly 20 minutes there for nothing. Next time, I'll make sure I get something from inside the airport.

The transfer was prompt in a very clean & air conditioned vehicle. The driver was friendly & did not speed like many in Fiji. The staff at the office/terminal was very friendly and capable. The waiting area was clean & air-conditioned. The restrooms were very clean with monograms towels. The flight took off on time. The pilot was friendly & informative. Upon our return they were professional in contacting us about the scheduled departure time being changed due to bad weather. At no time did we feel unsafe even though the weather was bad. They transfer to the airport was swift & in a similar vehicle to the one which picked us up. I would recommend them to anyone & would use their services again.
Pam G|443662914BD0E26107774DB12FD5E2D1|Hotel|Naukacuvu Island: Paradise Cove Resort|1| “Paradise? What a misnomer!”|review_361627902|Paradise? What a misnomer!After reviewing all the great recommendations from past guests from that resort we went there to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. We travel very regularly throughout Europe, Mauritius and this is actually our 20th visit to Fiji according to Fiji customs on the way out. So this review is one of the hardest I find myself making. Accommodation: we booked the 1 bedroom villa on the beach. It looked as spectacular as in the pictures on the net. Nothing to fault with the look. Just amazing. But the outdoor bathroom, even though it looks just stunning it was in the picture it is SO impractical. It is completely outdoor. My fault; when they said 'outdoor shower', I wrongly assumed that it would be semi-outdoor; that it could never be completely outdoor in the tropics. Well it is. We had a nest of wasps (they called them hornets) in the gutter in our bathroom as well as 3 wasps cocoons being built on the posts in our bathroom. Imagine the amount of wasps flying around practically all the time. The mosquitoes at night. The flies every time we emptied our bowels!! I even had a yellow & brown coloured spider visiting me while I was showering! It was most unpleasant. On our last night, we even had a cockroach that fell on my husband as he opened the door to go out to the bathroom (I have photos after he killed it as proof, however I think it's gross to upload that). Now let's talk about the weather in the bathroom. It rained, showered, it was windy, it was cool at night. We did not feel we were at a resort but as if we were camping somewhere being at the hands of the temperament of nature before having a shower. Who on earth designed such idiocy? At least give the guests an option by also having an indoor shower. Close the outdoor area with glass or something so that guests are not forced to be victims of such situations. I suffer from a lung condition and I feared the effects of the cool breeze on my health every night when showering. It's just wrong. The Windows or lack of: The rooms have plenty of plantation shutters but no windows. Unfortunately due to the high winds that seem to blow constantly, the howling or screeching sound they make at night stopped me from sleeping. Again, who's that idiot who designed that? Maybe he/she should spend one night trying to sleep with the wind screeching through the shutters all night long & we'll see how fast those stupid designs are abandoned. Get windows in those rooms pronto. Also, sand blows in. Ask the cleaners. The bites in the room: as of the second night, my husband & I became food to some sort of bites while sleeping. We complained after the first morning it happened & a whole team of cleaners came to our room to thoroughly clean everything as they could see the bites on us, particularly on me. I had not gone in the sea, so it could not be sea lice or anything like that. The second night, we were bitten again. The third night, we sprayed ourselves before going to bed & woke up without any new bites.No authentic Fiji look:Lack of Fijian look with the roof that we are so used to seeing around in Fiji. It was so apparent as we approached by air. However we understand, because the high winds would most likely blow everything away very quickly. The restaurant, menu & food: The restaurant looked very nice & I really appreciated the fact that there was plenty of space between the tables so that you got some privacy.The menu choice was quite poor.Breakfast: supposed buffet & à la carte hot food. The choice at the buffet is very limited. We finally got croissants on our 4th morning; no yoghurt; no cheese (had to ask) ; no cold meat. The coffee choice was only a coffee pot; we had to pay for our expressos even after we were told by a waitress whose name can be provided if asked that espressos were included in the breakfasts. At least have a coffee machine like many resorts do nowadays (eg Sofitel Resort & Spa Denarau).Lunch: Choice is again very limited but ok. Dinner: To start with, there is not enough light for us to read our menu. They must see nearly every guests with their phone lights on to read to menu. What does that mean? There's not enough light. Do something about it. It's ridiculous. Menu choice & quantity:Same choice 2 days in a row with only 4 choices per course is quite poor. The quantity served is unbelievable. For the first time in my life, I had to tell the waiter that my main was just not enough. I ordered the local fish with purée of 3 different vegetables & I got 2 VERY TINY pieces of fish & a few DOTS around my plates. It looked even too small for a usual entrée. I had to state my amazement & shock. The waiter brought me another serve & Only then was I able to be satisfied. The whole episode made me feel like a glutton but I should not. It was just ridiculous. As mentioned above, we are well travelled & this was a first. Whenever in Fiji, if able, we dine at V restaurant at Sofitel. It is haute cuisine & by God, the food is just amazing & so is the quantity. Maybe the chef at Paradise Cove resort could just pop over there for a little chat & advice.The lack of path lights:Thank God for my phone light that allowed us to move from our villa to the restaurant & back every night. It is pitch black. The hotel puts one tiny tea candle light in a lantern every now & then supposedly to light guests' paths!! However every guests use their phone light. Maybe the hotel should think why that is so. The paths:The paths leading from the rooms to the restaurant & pool are non existent. It is a struggle to walk back & forth while sinking in the sand. All of the resorts we have stayed in Fiji since 1996 are on islands & they all have hardened the paths somehow, making it easier for their guests to move about. The sand, wind & beach. We have learnt too late that the winds blow strongly on that resort affecting the beach, the sea and guests comfort generally. The photos of beach on the net for this resort are deceptive. There are corals, broken shells everywhere. They are so sharp that it makes it impossible to walk on the beach or even go in the water. On our second afternoon, there were 5 staff members with huge bags collecting the bigger corals that had washed up. But it did not change anything. Guests stayed away from the beach. It was unpleasant. Another reason that made it so was the wind. We can't go on the beach for fear of being whipped by flying sand. Believe me, it hurts. The sea is so rough all the time that we just did not dare go into the sea. The whole time we were there, we saw just 2 people twice (on the first & on the 4 day) in the sea & they lasted not even 5 minutes!! On our last day, we saw a young couple of honeymooners attempting to go into the sea & giving up after standing in the water for approximately 30 seconds. So sad to see. The pool: Just a plain rectangular pool. Nothing to write home about. However, knowing how bad the sea is in front of the resort, those hotel designers could have put some more thoughts into designing a nicer pool. The people: As usual, everyone is Fiji is always absolutely lovely. A special thank you to Mika for trying to make our second honeymoon somewhat better. He was most attentive to us & even organised a special song for our anniversary as well as a special celebratory dessert (see photo). I have to say how quick they were to respond to our call to fix our roof that banged all night due to high winds on our second night. Another one came each time we called to fix the tv that would not connect for 2 days. Another team came to change our phone when they realised that lines were crossing. All we knew is that they kept on calling asking for another room. Vinaka vakalevu to all the Fijians at Paradise Cove. Just beautiful people. Overall: What a disappointment! What a misnomer! Nothing paradisal about this place. We will never go back there. We hope to meet the lovely workers again but in another resort. God willing, we will go back to beautiful Fiji but never to that particular resort.

Our taxi driver recommended it. It was extremely clean, air conditioned, beautiful service, the choice for breakfast was quite big and the cost was very reasonable. The coffees were good and came very promptly. The quality of the food that came was beyond reproach. The quantity was very good for two hungry people. I saw some lovely freshly baked cakes and cookies being brought as we were finishing our breakfast. I would highly recommend this cafe to all.
Pam G|443662914BD0E26107774DB12FD5E2D1|Hotel|Nadi: Fiji Gateway Hotel|1| “Horror”|review_359930533|We were sent there to wait for our sea plane connection as we landed quite early in the day. We planned to have breakfast while waiting. The continental breakfast choice was very poor. The worst was when I asked for skim or low fat milk to have with my cereals, I was initially told they did not know what I was talking about, followed by they did not have any. When I told them that I was allergic to full cream milk, suddenly they knew what I was talking about and went looking for some at the bar. Unfortunately what they brought me was off. When I put a spoonful of it with my cereal in my mouth, I could not help spitting it right out. When I told them that the milk was off, they looked at me as if I was talking a foreign language. What a horrible experience. The horrible taste stayed in my mouth for hours. Please do not go there for stop overs or anything else. Hotels at Denarau are only 12kms away from the airport, we usually take around 20 minutes to get there. If you need a good breakfast just around the corner from the airport just go to Cafe O, maximum 10 minutes from the airport in heavy traffic.

Pam G|443662914BD0E26107774DB12FD5E2D1|Hotel|Denarau Island: Sofitel Fiji Resort & Spa|2| “Too noisy & disappointing ”|review_344864045|This was our 5th visit there. We obviously liked it that's why we went back. But after this visit we are going to think long & hard before going back. If ever. Out of 5 nights there, we were woken up 4 mornings between 7:30am to 8:00am by staff hammering, pulling heaving stuff & God knows what else waking us up while we are on holidays. I understand that work has to be done but that early & that loud?! Tourists pay a lot to come relax & sleeping in is part of it.We had to call the front desk every day & I even spoke to the duty manager about it. Once should have been more than enough. It never stopped. Our complaints never stopped. Well I'm putting it in writing now. Pity. Another matter: we arrived at the hotel at 12:30pm, I admit prior to check-in time which is 2:00pm. We booked two connecting rooms. I got one around 3:30pm and did not get the second one until 5:30 pm. Every time I called to ask about the second room, I was told that someone was going to call me back straight away which they never did. That went on for two hours. Every time I went to the front desk to see what was going on, they kept on giving me free drink vouchers. I did not want free drink vouchers, I wanted my room. Such lack of service & such disregard from a 5star hotel is disappointing. We are Accor Le Club members & I have to admit that our last stay at the Sofitel Fiji Spa Resort was bad. Maybe if they need repairs done they should think of closing it down for renovations. We travel often to Mauritius & I often see 5star resorts closed down temporarily for that reason. Also, a page from there too, maintenance & cleaning work do not start until breakfast has finished which is after 11:00am. Regarding the turn down service, it should be done during dinner time while patrons are at dinner, fresh towels should given, beds turned down etc. No one should walk in on people while they are naked getting ready for dinner which happened to us twice. We had to put the do not disturb sign on & we were told they do not supply fresh towels! Maybe take a look at what other 5 star resorts do around the world & learn. Oh, I nearly forgot the lack of pool lounges & the dangerous umbrellas. Twice they fell on us & we witnessed about 10 falling around us. One fell on a pram, thank God the baby was in the mother's arms at that time. After that we decided to go to the beach for fear of getting hurt. They never used to have such poor quality ones. What's going there?! The wind was not that strong to cause them to fall so much. Get better ones, get rid of those flimsy ones. Real pity.

It was a lovely surprise. We spent 5 nights at Castaway Island resort in January this year. It was our first stay at Castaway Island resort. We had been there before on day trips but never stayed. We have had a most memorable and happy time there. Thank you to every staff on the island. We were welcomed by all, from top to bottom. Vinaka vakalevu. However we would like to say a special thank you to a few people who have touched us most, namely: cheeky Aquila for the ride of our lives (lol); generous Jerry (Vinaka dear friend); Nox ( thanks for sharing your home with us); Freddy (THANKS mate for the dolphins) and Mere from the boathouse. All the lovely F&B staff, from the chef to the waiters. Thank you for the great menu & food. A special thank you to Monica, Emori, Uraia, Arieta, Ratu at the restaurant. Thank you everyone for spoiling us with the most special dinner on the beach on our last night. Emily with her cocktails! Keep them coming. Thanks Edwina who spoilt the girls with lovely manicures. Dear Arieta who spent so long doing my daughter's hair. Vinaka. A special thank you to the masseuses whose names we did not catch as we were half asleep when they finished with us. So good.

Tour guide: Helen, driver: Francois. Both very good. Helen was most informative, patient & very nice. She was most accommodating. Farewelled the group at Mont St Michel to go back to Paris & joined another bus, 2 tour guides & 2 drivers. Drama at the start: they gave the impression that there were at least 6 people missing, so we had to wait a while until they got the ok from the office to leave. Shortly after takeoff, I understood that they did not count properly & that there was no one missing! Wasted everyone's time. Into the trip now & Laura is actually lying, feet on the seats in front of me, reading a book!!! Not a word has been said. It looks like the tour is finished. Disappointing & unprofessional attitude. 2 hours into the trip back to Paris, getting back onto the bus after a pit stop, Natty announced that the people that were supposedly missing never were but we're in fact on the bus in front of us. They chatted between themselves ignoring everyone one else on the bus. Other people grumbled about their attitudes during the pit stop. In the meantime, we're running 45 minutes late. I've had to cancel a car that were to pick us up at Paris City tours office around 9:00pm, the scheduled drop off time. We're now facing public transport in a strange city at night thanks to 2 incompetent tour guides. O my gosh, I was sleeping on the way to Paris & was just jostled out of my sleep by the driver named Marc (seated behind me) who had decided to listen loudly to the radio , some horse racing thing. This trip is still going downhill. As a compensation, they should have at least offered taxi fares for everyone to their hotels or other destinations. Laura, Natty, Fernando & Marc On the other side of the river around Musee d'orsay. Camion coincé dans le tunnel et le chauffeur a dit putain au moins trois fois en rainy avec toute l'équipe!!

When we finally got to jump it was amazing, the guy I jumped with was very friendly and informative. It didn't take too long to get photos and video after. The ladies inside signing you in are fantastic and we had a great experience with these guys. Would highly recommend them.

We went here at the end of our trip so we'd seen a lot of other places and this was the worst, it was very dirty compared to everywhere else we'd been (and Singapore in general) and smelly and no one was friendly. The buildings are very colourful and having a wander round was interesting enough but I wouldn't go back. I would also not recommend walking through the hawker hall which connects to the train station, I have never smelt anything so bad in my life, it put me off wanting to eat anything at all. I would much rather spend my time exploring other parts of Singapore.

The people were very friendly and helpful and it's reasonably priced. The coffee and pastries reminded me of home and they were always spot on. The layout of the cafe is also very nice. If you're looking for something a bit more Singaporean then maybe this isn't the best spot, but if you're looking for great coffee then definitely give it a go! I would love to go back here if we're ever in Singapore again.

We were told the smaller one behind it would be available for pictures but this too was under-going maintenance and was closed. Very disappointing that they were both unavailable and I'm not sure why it takes 4 weeks to clean the Merlion... it sits out n the rain so I'm not sure how clean it would be anyway. On our last day the scaffolding was taken off the front but you still couldn't see much and you didn't get the whole effect without the water. Definitely check the dates of cleaning before you go so you're not disappointed!

I was here for a week and used the SMRT multiple times a day, there was never a late train, never a cancelled train and I never had to walk more than 10 minutes to get anywhere once I got off. It was amazing. And the train to the airport is so handy.The only thing I found odd was that the tourist pass can only be used for 3 days at a time... we had to top ours up halfway through our trip which was a bit annoying as they're only available at certain stations. Other than that, it was perfect.

Would recommend heading up just for that! The setting is really cool, you can see aspects of the brewery as you walk through. I can't actually remember the name of the beer I drank, but it was really good, I had 2 more. It's very expensive, but alcohol in Singapore is anyway and I would say it's worth it for the view you have. You can see the Supertree light show (can't hear the music obviously) and you can also see the Marina Bay light show. Tiny little critique is that the lift takes forever (I know it's 33 floors up but I stayed 49 floors up at MBS and the lift only took half the time) and it gets very crowded as there's only 1.

It's about a 10 min walk from the MRT straight down the road as well so it's pretty easy to get to. The service was good and the staff were very friendly, there was also a box of costumes when you walk in which was pretty cool.The food and drinks are average which is why I gave it this score because a restaurant should still be about the food even if it is a bit of a fun. It is reasonably priced by Singapore standards though and I would recommend giving it a go if you get the chance, just for the spectacle.

It was still a pretty fun day out but it lacked a bit of character. We bought the express pass which works on majority of the rides at the park and I have to say it paid for itself 5 times over. We skipped numerous ques which had waiting times of over 90 minutes... our longest wait was about 5. It was a lifesaver in the heat as well as a lot of the line areas aren't air conditioned and it was extremely hot. The food was extremely overpriced, which you expect so it's fine, but it was also really terrible... I don't know if we just chose the wrong places to eat but we didn't like anything. Getting there is super easy, it's just a tram ride over and you can buy you ticket to the park when you buy for the tram so you don't have to wait in line twice. I would still recommend going, but I won't be going back.

We ate here whenever we got the opportunity.There are so many different options, everyone is extremely friendly, the food is insanely cheap and it's incredible. We didn't have one bad dish the entire time and I think we spent 50$ over about a week, saved us so much money. Our taxi driver told us this is the place he would recommend going as it's the most authentic Singaporean food center he knows of. I would highly recommend it and I'll be going back if I'm ever in Singapore again!

The structure itself is pretty incredible, you can get a good look at it when you take the walk all the way down form the top. There is tons of information on the incredible gardens and flowers and the waterfall is very impressive. It's just really interesting to walk through. They also have a small Lego garden near the top which is really cool.
Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Zoo|1| “Terrible Zoo”|review_463916258|This zoo is terrible, the animal enclosures are tiny, a lot of them are just in there by themselves and look bored out of their brain and sad, running back and forth along glass walls continuously. The elephant show is appalling, this is a zoo not a bloody circus, no self respecting zoo would have their animals perform like that these days. And then they just take the elephants away... probably to a cardboard box somewhere until the next show. Not to mention everything is a money grab, $5 to feed the poor elephants, $5 to have an extra viewing. It's ridiculous. The night safari includes mostly deer of varying kinds and 1 tiger. The only good thing about it was that the animals actually had some space to move around without glass walls. The river safari at the beginning is ok, definitely the best part of the zoo. It's very expensive for what it is, there are very few food options and the options that you do have are expensive because it's not like you can go anywhere else.I wouldn't ever go back here, it's by far the worst zoo I have ever been to and it highlights the massive cultural differences in how people treat their animals.
Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Attractions|Singapore: Supertree Grove|5| “Definitely worth seeing”|review_463914929|The supertree's are very impressive and very well landscaped. We saw them during the day and at night and they are equally impressive either way. The light show to music is worth seeing but I wouldn't really recommend going up to do the sky walk. It's only about $8 a person but the view is nothing special, you can get the same from a number of other places that are free or that offer more of an experience to go with the view.
Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Attractions|Singapore: Flower Dome|3| “Pretty”|review_463914171|We went to the cloud forest first and then walked through the flower dome... I would probably recommend doing it in the reverse order as I found the flower dome to be much less impressive. It's very pretty and well put together and we went during Chinese New Year so they had an extra display which had great decorations, but I just found it underwhelming. If you're super into flowers then I'm sure you'll love it, but there are much better things to see if you don't want to fork out the money for entry.
Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Hotel|Singapore: Marina Bay Sands|5| “Worth it just for the pool”|review_463912708|We spent our last night in Singapore at Marina Bay and it didn't disappoint. We booked a club room so it was very large and had a balcony overlooking Gardens by the Bay, which was incredible. Afternoon tea, evening drinks and breakfast at the club were fantastic and we enjoyed every second of it. We didn't eat or drink anywhere else so we didn't have to experience the crowds some people are talking about. Check in was easy and quick, there was no line to speak of and the man at reception was lovely and helpful. I would definitely recommend doing the express check out though, it literally took 2 minutes to fill the form in and drop it off.The infinity pool was incredible, worth every cent we paid. It was very busy at all times but it wasn't so crowded that you couldn't get a great photo, plus just looking at the view is amazing. I wouldn't stay here for my whole trip, but it was definitely worth the night!
Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Attractions|Daylesford: Daylesford Day Spa|4| “Relaxing ”|review_440077748|We were told to arrive for our massage and facial 15 mins before our appointment but we didn't end up getting into the room until 20 mins after our actual appointment time so the wait was a little annoying, but other than that it was good. The massage could have been a little firmer but it was very relaxing as promised and the facial was amazing, loved it. Also loved that no one tried to push products on us at the end, just gave us a sheet of paper with what was used and what they'd recommend, much appreciated! The ladies who treated us were very lovely the whole time and the front desk ladies were also great. I would definitely go back here.
Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Restaurant|Ripponlea: Attica|4| “It's an experience”|review_440076549|To say it's overpriced would be a serious understatement given that one of their main selling points throughout the evening was that everything comes from the tiny garden out the back or a farmer down the road, so not sure why I needed to pay $400 for it. But anyway, the service was exceptional, the explanation of all the food and wine was fantastic and interesting and we were seated in the semi private room up the front so the setting and the atmosphere was awesome. It was an experience that I won't forget.... in some small part because I seemed to spend a lot of time eating plants. Horror dish of the night was a 'chicken broth' which was literally murky water with a bunch of leaves thrown in, followed by the tulip dessert. Just because a tulip isn't poisonous doesn't mean it's edible, lesson learned. But I found the rest of the courses to be very nice, as we're the accompanying drinks and the whole thing was an experience that you just don't get very often. I wouldn't go back but I would still recommend it!

The course options are very well balanced between different types of foods to keep everyone happy and the size of the courses is perfect. Our waiter was great at explaining the different options we had and also recommending drinks. And the food was always quick to get to us and perfectly cooked. It's very, very expensive, but that's really it's only downfall!

The cocktails are also very nice and they give you a doggy bag if you don't finish your food. Would definitely go back.
Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Attractions|Hamilton Island: One Tree Hill Sunset Cocktails|4| “Fantastic views”|review_397073036|The views from One Tree Hill are incredible and it's worth going just to see the sunset. The cocktails are cheap, but they would want to be considering they're all premixed and taste like they contain no actual alcohol. It gets very busy around sunset so would recommend going a little early to get a good spot. You can also take your own drinks to the rotunda they have on the hill which is awesome. It's a great atmosphere and a great spot!
Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Attractions|Hamilton Island: WILD LIFE Hamilton Island|3| “Too Expensive”|review_397071175|We went for the cuddle a Koala experience and were told on arrival that we could only pat them today, the lady did ask if we wanted to come back another day when it was available but it was our last day so we paid the $90!!!!!! for breakfast and a photo for 2 people. Ridiculously overpriced, even for Hamilton. The food was ok but definitely better elsewhere for a cheaper price. We also paid for 2 people but got our photo taken together so we only received 1 actual photo. You do get the chance to take your own photos with the Koala which is great but it means that the family of 4 in front of us took FOREVER. I understand them wanting to have their turn at the experience but it took far too long. Overall it was an ok experience but given my time again I probably wouldn't pay the money for what I got.

The staff were very friendly and accommodating and we would definitely go back if we return to Hamo!
Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Attractions|Hamilton Island: Hamilton Island Watersports|3| “Awesome beach, staff not super friendly ”|review_396467017|We did the Whitehaven beach dash, the staff at the checkin were friendly enough but not very informative. Once we made our way down to the boat our 'deckhand' was very short and unresponsive to everyone on the tour, our driver just seemed bored with the whole thing. The beach was amazing and we got to spend a good amount of time there but there was not indication of things to do or see on the beach from the company, just a very old bag with very old beach toys in it. Our deckhand disappeared for the whole time and the tide came in washing the esky she had there nearly out to sea. We had to rescue it with no thanks from her when she finally returned. The speed of the boat trip was good but the customer service of this place could be greatly, greatly improved.

Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Hotel|Warburton: Forget Me Not Cottages|3| “Nice spot, but the spa was a disappointment”|review_355432840|I booked this accommodation purely for the fact that it had an outdoor spa so I was very excited to get there and try it out, however we couldn't even get in it as it was a million degrees. It was literally too hot to put your foot in for more than 2 seconds. I pulled mine out and it was red raw and stinging. We turned the air bubbles on to try and cool it down, but this process took over an hour and a half and it was still too hot to be in for more than 5 minutes, it was absolutely ridiculous and such a let down. The location was good, it was very quiet, the food provided was nice and the cottage itself was small but cute, if seriously lacking in lighting (had to use my phone torch on numerous occasions, I get going for romantic, but being able to see would be preferable). Overall it was a nice place but considering I booked (and paid) for the spa not being able to use it was such a disappointment.
Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Attractions|Melbourne: Aussie Brewery Tours|4| “Fun day”|review_355431876|We went on the Sunday tour, it started off really well at the Napoleone brewery with whole jugs of beer and a lot of interesting information, it sort of became a bit more of a pub crawl as the day went on though as the group got separated and there wasn't a lot brewery related talk happening. Would have liked more opportunities to do a bit of a tour of the actual breweries or a conversation with the brewers themselves, but Scott provided some good info and banter on the bus ride. Lunch was also very nice at Hargreaves but this was more a pub than a brewery as well.

The food was fantastic, the variety to choose from was also great. The service was spot on and the staff were super friendly. The restaurant itself is also very nice inside. I would go back any day of the week.

It's definitely not a Zoo, but it was interesting enough, just felt like it was mostly aimed at children. Managed to do the whole place in about 30 minutes. The Tassie Devils were the best thing in there.
Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Attractions|Sydney: Madame Tussauds Sydney|3| “Takes a long time to get photos, but it's ok”|review_350961423|I've been to Madame Tussauds in London and New York so I was looking forward to visiting the Sydney one, but the others were much bigger with a lot more to look at and a lot more interactive things to do. Sydney's version was ok, they have a lot of Australian figures which would probably be more interesting to overseas tourists, like the UK & American versions were for me.Overall it was pretty good, but I wouldn't go again. It was too expensive for something that took me all of 30 minutes to walk through because I couldn't be bothered lining up for 20 minutes behind the bus load of tourists who went in before me for a photo.
Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Hotel|Sydney: Ovolo Woolloomooloo|3| “Didn't actually book this location, but hotel design was very nice”|review_350960845|I actually booked the Ovolo at Darling Harbour and was notified 2 weeks before I was due to stay there that I was being shifted to the Woolloomooloo one instead. I booked the one at Darling Harbour because of the location so I was less than impressed to be moved with absolutely no reason provided at all. I suspect it was because they were trying to get people to see the new renos at the wharf. The service provided by Rachael on the switch over was very good however, and we did receive free cab rides to the Harbour as compensation. I also received a room upgrade to something twice the size of what I originally booked. The room was lovely but if that was twice the size of the last one, I was getting seriously ripped off. Our bathroom also wasn't renovated like the website suggested it would be.The hotel bar and area was really awesome, the freebies were great and so was the service we received from reception. I would probably stay here again now that I've been, but the muck around with being moved kind of put me off.

You get what you pay for as the food is a bit hit and miss but we like the laid back atmosphere and we always enjoy our breakfast. We'll keep coming as long as we live in the area.

It's our go to restaurant in China Town. There is a huge variety of food and drink and it's all great, I'm yet to have a bad meal here. Not to mention we're frequently the last people in the place on a Saturday night and we've never once been rushed along or asked to leave. The service can be a bit spotty when it's very busy but otherwise I don't have a bad word to say. Love it

Without the waiter bothering to grace our table again the whole time after he took our drinks order. Which also took about 20 minutes too long. When we finally got the food, after asking about it twice and being told it was 5 minutes minutes away each time, it was too mediocre to even care about eating it. Not to mention the fact that it was about $20 too expensive for what it was. The whole dining experience was ruined and I will never be going here again.

Bit heartbreaking but I would not recommend wasting $20 on this pointless display
Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Attractions|Fox Glacier: Glacier Helicopters|3| “Incredible views ”|review_323253479|The views on our flight were breathtaking, the average review is mainly for the fact that we paid $900 for two people on a 40 minute flight and the only thing the pilot said the whole time was this is Mt Cook, Tasman and the glaciers... I thought we would get some info about all of them, maybe some fun facts... Nothing. We also only got a 35 minute flight and had to pay the full 4 hour one. I would recommend if you have a lot of spare cash, otherwise a walk would probably be better.

Would probably steer clear if you're an experienced rafter but for everyone else would highly recommend

The only downfall is that it's very expensive... But if you're in Queenstown you can't leave without trying a swing so I highly recommend it!

Super expensive for something really not that impressive.The luge was lots of fun, would recommend getting a few runs if you can as they're not very long. Basically if I didn't have to walk up a steep hill for an hour I would have skipped the gondola altogether.

They were too short and the view was lacking in all but 2 line, everything else was trees. For the $185 we paid we expected so much more. The guides were nice but seemed like they were just going through the motions. I would recommend spending the money on doing something else for 3hours.

Aside from the temple there is also nothing to do here... and the little market stalls on the way out make it seem a little cheap... it was good to see but wouldn't go back.
Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Attractions|Sumida: Tokyo Skytree|3| “Go on a weekday”|review_280514412|We went on a weekday late in the afternoon and managed to avoid all the crowds most people seem to encounter, ours was a last minute decision to go so we never looked into on-line bookings etc. Only waited for 5 minutes in the line and it wasn't very crowded up the top so we had ample opportunity to get photos. I would definitely recommend going at night if possible, the view after dark was more impressive, aside from seeing the extent of the smog in the daylight. It's expensive, and costs even more if you want to go to the very top, but if you have the cash it's worth a look. If you don't then you're not really missing an essential Tokyo experience
Alexandra J|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|Attractions|Hiroshima: Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum|4| “Very interesting place to visit”|review_280513335|The grounds of the Peace Memorial Park are beautiful and very well kept. I was slightly underwhelmed by the Atomic Bomb Dome, but it was still eye opening to see the destruction caused to the building. I found the museum to be extremely interesting, we all know what happened and have possibly seen pictures, but actually seeing these things up close is very different to simply reading about it. There is no context provided for when the bomb was dropped during the war, it is simply facts stated from the actual event which some people seemed to disapprove of. There are a lot of school groups going through the museum which takes away from the effect a little as they seem to view it as a day off school rather than a learning experience. Despite this I would definitely recommend a visit here just for the experience.

The staff were very friendly and helpful and all signage is in English as well as Japanese. Granted we didn't see any shows so I'm not sure of subtitles on those etc. definitely pay for a fast pass if you can, they are super handy and make sure if your an international traveller you take cash with you, as there are no ATM's that accept international cards... It was an expensive day but a lot of fun.

Smelt disgusting, and the tiny window was no help. The room was large by Japanese standards and clean but very noisy and there are much nicer places to stay for the same price that are a shorter distance from the Shinjuku station. It's also in the middle of the red light district and you can pay by the hour... Overall I wouldn't stay there again.

Be prepared for a LOT of people, some of them are quite pushy when down by the fountain trying to take photos or throw coins in, but everyone gets their turn. We went during the day and at night and it was actually busier at night but for some reason it seemed calmer. If you have time I would recommend seeing it during the day and at night. I absolutely loved it and would go back in a heartbeat, it was breathtaking.

We had an excellent view of the Vivid Lights Show in Darling Harbor.Rooms are clean and comfortable. Food was good. Front Office/Reception area was great - shout out to Nitish, who made checking in painless and fast, as opposed to this other guy (whose name I fortunately forgot, who kept insisting that they had no record of our valid Agoda booking, he kept saying that our reservation was cancelled - he exerted absolutely zero effort in listening to our explanation when we mentioned that we cancelled one booking and had another confirmed one - I suddenly remembered all the negative reviews on here about their customer service and wondered whether he was the source of it). Everyone else we spoke to was great!We loved our time here. We will be back, and we will definitely stay here again - but will just not go to THAT guy in the front office! LOL!This place was perfect for us.

For an extra 90 minutes one way, you will be duly rewarded if you journey further to witness the majesty of the South Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park instead.In comparison, the West Rim has the novel glass Sky Bridge, but seeing the expanse at the South Rim in person will simply take your breath away as pictures and videos cannot do it justice at all. I had walked on the Sky Bridge and it is indeed an experience. I had also enjoyed a memorable helicopter landing on the canyon floor and pontoon boat ride along the Colorado River at the West Rim, but somehow that portion of Grand Canyon lacks the supreme and superlative scale of the South Rim.Hence, if you are hard-pressed to only choose one, do the South Rim instead please. Otherwise, do both South and West as they are each unique in their own right and gorgeous glory.It is interesting to note that the West Rim is not part of the National Park, but belongs to the Hualapai Indians.Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Even this single long English word cannot adequately describe the Grand Canyon. Words woefully fail us when we try to describe the statuesque and stunning South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park.Even for my second visit, one will still be left awestruck with the awe-inspiring panoramic vista before you.As a Seven Wonders of the Natural World, this is obviously an internationally famous scenic attraction, so it is extremely crowded. One should go early to beat the crowds.If you are able to, spend 1 night at their lodges so you can see both sunset and sunrise. Otherwise, opt for a day tour which has a Sun Set tour option so that you can witness / capture the magnificent, memorable hues of the sun setting over the graceful Grand Canyon. There is indeed a reason that National Geographic rates Grand Canyon as one of the ten places in the world to watch a sunset.After the crowds dispersed, we lingered for another 15 minutes and enjoyed the alluring, bewitching and peaceful twilight at Grand Canyon.Pack a picnic lunch to eat right at the rim of Grand Canyon, so that you can spend more time admiring the spectacular scenery before you.We visited these lookout points : Mather Point, Yavapai Point and Granger Point (where we saw the sunset). These scenic points offer captivating and perfect postcard pictures. The trails are very easy, and relatively flat.Absolutely not to be missed by locals and overseas guests, especially if one is already at Las Vegas. Everyone, young and old will be awestruck with the impressive South Rim of the overwhelming Grand Canyon National Park.Grand Canyon National Park is indeed everyone's bucket list of must-see natural WONDER of epic proportion.

Surprisingly, the dam is much smaller then it looks on TV or in those Superman movies.The colours of the water in the dam are a gorgeous turquoise blue, and this lookout point is rather scenic with beautiful picture taking opportunities.Hoover Dam was the most expensive engineering project in U.S. history at the time of its construction. When Hoover Dam was finished in 1935 it was the tallest dam in the world.Hoover Dam is 726.4 feet (221.3 meters) tall. Today, Hoover Dam still ranks in the top 20 of the tallest dams in the world.Hence, still an impressive and delightful Dam to stop-by and see.Sorry that I cannot upload any pictures, with my review now.Helen LimSingapore

Seligman is also home to the real Angel of Route 66.There was a time in America when Route 66 was the major thoroughway that connect East to West. It began in Chicago and ended at the Santa Monica Pier. It was decertified and removed from the maps in 1978 when Interstate 40 opened. It took a true Angel to lobby the Arizona government to recertify it as Historic Route 66. Angel's tireless efforts virtually saved the remaining parts from extinction. It was his actions that inspired John Lassiter to write the movie "Cars".Bring a waterproof marker to sign your name and pen a message on the "peace" Volkswagen van.There are many interesting historic Route 66 souvenirs and mementos that one can buy at this quaint but well-stocked gift shop.Seligman is worthy of a stop, to soak in an historic ole homely American cosy town feel, and partake of a part of historic Route 66.Helen LimSingapore

It was formed by fault subsidence that continues today, slowly deepening the lake along the eastern side.This is a beautiful lake ideal for boating, water skiing, swimming, sailing, fishing and famous raspberry shakes.Strongly recommended to stop by, and see this breathtaking Bear Lake.Helen LimSingapore

For a closer look, accessible hikes take you into the amphitheater to see the hoodoos.One can take a moonlit hike among the horseshoe-shaped amphitheaters and simply be moonstruck at the beauty.Swoon over the hoodoos (mesmerizing pillars of eroded rock), plus sip some of the best air and snap post-card perfect pictures of some of the most bizarre rocks in the country.Beauteous Bryce Canyon in Utah certainly stands alone among natural phenomena, with its vibrant red rock structures and hoodoos.The horseshoe-shaped amphitheaters that make up the park provide stunning views of the hoodoos.It is an alluring and unique sight of geological formations shaped like oversized totem poles that are a result of frost weathering and erosion.

The snowcapped mountains, pristine alpine lakes and evergreen forests simply take your breath away.We had gone on a gentle 10 mile 100 minute guided float ride down the picturesque Snake River through Grand Teton National Park. This covers the most scenic stretch of the Snake River in the Jackson Hole Valley. The Snake River with its lush willows to feed on and deep water pools to swim in, is a lifeline to the park's rich and diverse wildlife.We saw pronghorn, deer, osprey and a bald eagle. There were many beaver lodges too.This will always be a memorable highlight of our USA trip.25 years ago during my college days, I had a poster of the famous Ansel Adams iconic shot of Snake River Overlook against the Gorgeous Grand Teton which I always wanted to visit.I was finally overwhelmed to finally be at this look-out point to experience the real McCoy, and finally tick off my bucket list.Whilst lesser known then the internationally famous Yellowstone, both locals and overseas visitors should take some take some time for the gorgeous and graceful Grand Teton National Park.Although Grand Teton is only 10 miles south of Yellowstone National Park, it remains remarkably less crowded.You will not regret coming by, and do go for the Snake River float trip please.Helen LimSingapore

The water is cold and inviting.This is a very popular and crowded National Park, so do go early for parking and the shuttle bus, and to beat the crowd .There is a cafe which is very crowded with long queues, so if possible pack your own picnic lunch before coming to this Park.There is a nice gift shop for your requisite mementos.Put on sun screen as the sun is relentless on a cloudless summer day, and apply insect repellant please. Also, bring a light jacket as it may get cool in the evening.Highly recommended National Park in Utah.Helen LimSingapore

I managed to find a Maltese one.For those who do not like to shop at all, you can rest at their sit-down eateries, for a quick bite.They still offer free ice water and 5 cent coffee.This row of stores is huge, and stock an incredibly wide array of souvenirs in their 76,000 square feet outlet.Go for the fun and experience of a quaint small town in America.You cannot miss this classic Drug Store at Wall, South Dakota since there are numerous huge road signs on Wall Drug, along the highway as you drive / travel.Helen LimSingapore

Their staff is very friendly.Half of the restaurant is full service sit-down, but as it was full, we sat at the other half whereby those with takeaways ate.We waited around 15 minutes which is well worth it as they assemble your burgers on a freshly made-to-order basis.We had their Pitmaster and Frenchman burgers.Their piquant Pitmaster is a delicious 1/3 pound beef patty grilled perfectly to our Medium Well doneness with BBQ pork shoulder and smoked gouda cheese, pickled jalapeno and smothered in chipotle aioli sauce. This was a satisfying dream concoction which created a party of dancing taste profiles and flavors on our palates.The fetching Frenchman is also delectable with 1/3 lb. beef burger, panchetta, grilled pear, brie, port reduction, caramelized onion.Either burger is USD10.Bottled water is only USD1.You can also sit outside and enjoy the vibrant Main Street Square events / scene of happening Rapid City (there was an outdoor concert then).Highly recommended stop for both locals and visitors, for a delish and economical gourmet burger meal.You will certainly enjoy yourself thoroughly, in this pleasing modern burger joint.Helen LimSingapore

We even had decadent Haagen-Dazs ice-cream.The stewardess frequently walk through the aisles with cups of water and juices.In-flight entertainment are great with a satisfactory selection of Hollywood's latest blockbusters and old movie favourites, Bollywood and Chinese movies as well as a superb array of TV series, music and games.Check-in of our luggages were efficiently performed by friendly counter staff.Seat spaces are adequate and comfortable, even in Economy claas.Highly recommended top-notch airlines for their flights of dependable, consistent quality and high calibre.

Their virgin mojito was fantastic.As for appetizers, we had delicious kale. The parma ham and Georgian peach platter was a refreshing mix of salty and sweet taste profiles on our palates.We also proclaimed their mac and cheese delectable.For entrees, we tried their decadent large shrimps and grits which made us great fans of this Southern comfort food.Our uncle and aunty also tried their fresh and delicious Georgian trout.Their hamburger also looked scrumptious.We thoroughly enjoyed this contemporary American food, which is cooked with fresh local produce.Their portions are adequate and satisfying.We skipped dessert.We ate al-fresco outside their patio in ideal weather, and sincerely appreciated that our cousin's adorable fur kid could also join us, in this lovely family dinner.There were also other couples who had brought their pet dogs with them, and I loved their company.Highly recommended American cuisine restaurant with genial Southern hospitality, for both locals and visitors alike, in the vibrant Midtown area of Atlanta.Helen LimSingapore

His face is 87 feet, and is the same size of all the 4 Presidents' faces on Mt. Rushmore, put together.There is no substitute for determination and hard work which is still ongoing, and this monumental mountain carving (which will certainly stand the test of time) will still take decades and scores to complete, since 1948 when Korczak began work with only USD147.Korczak and his wife Ruth also fulfilled their dream to have the Indian University of North America, which started in summer 2010.It is heartening that their tireless vision and persistent efforts are continued on by their children and grandchildren.They have left a lasting legacy for one and all.Hence, Crazy Horse Memorial is indeed a worthy and must-see tour, for both locals and overseas visitors alike.Helen LimSingapore

Washington's nose is 21 feet long. The eyes are about 11 feet wide, and the mouths 18 feet wide.During the next day, we went on the Presidential Trail which is 0.5 miles and starts from Grand View Terrace.Around 400 people worked at Mount Rushmore which took 14 years to complete, and thankfully no lives were lost despite the ardous and dangerous work.They also have a nice gift shop which offers a wide array of momentos.Highly recommended for both locals, and overseas visitors alike.Helen LimSingapore

It is named after the dead trees found in its gulch. This quaint town's image of the wild West town has lingered, due to past events and the individuals responsible for making the town into a legend. Famous figures like Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane each left their mark. Our tour did an unexpected but welcomed stop at this crowded touristy cowboy town.There are many cafes and a few casinos which are fashioned after the good ole towns of the Wild Wild West.At 4pm, along a section of their Main Street, they re-enact a shoot out scene which is rather interesting.Delightful Deadwood is a nice American town to soak in the past atmosphere of the exciting but rough and lawless West, back in the 19th century.There are many souvenir shops to get various Deadwood or South Dakota or Mount Rushmore mementos.There is also a nice Harley Davidson store at Deadwood.Recommended stop for both locals and overseas visitors alike.Helen LimSingapore

Also, it would be appreciated if they provide shower gel for those who do not use bath soap.They have an airport shuttle bus service, which also kindly took us to a 24 hour Walmart, 9 minutes away.Thankfully, we had the requisite WiFi in the room.The LED TV is small though.Breakfast for our tour group was served at a conference room, on the 3rd floor.Adequate buffet breakfast with hot scrambled eggs, bacon and susage.We bought drinks, and their front desk staff are really friendly.Billings is a charming town in Montana.

There is also a small mini fridge.The room was clean and decently sized with 2 double beds. There is no sofa, but there are 2 chairs.The beds are fine, but the pillows are too flat, and gave me a stiff neck.Their toilet is small but functional, with a hot water shower stall.They provide their own pump bottles of toiletries such as hand wash, body lotion, body gel, shampoo and conditioner.They have recycle trays for our plastic bottles etc.Their Administration office (where you get the room card keys) are a 8 minutes walk away.Dining options are at the 'fine dining' Dining Room for which reservations are needed, and they do NOT do takeouts.The Lake House Restaurant offers more casual and economical fare, and they do takeouts. There is stupendous views of the Yellowstone Lake, 5 mins walk from the lodge.They provide a concise but helpful tourist guide booklet to Yellowstone National Park.Strangely, their vending machines do not sell bottled water, so we propose that they kindly consider this soon.But there is a water cooler, at the entrance.Helen LimSingapore

For vegetarians, there was lasagne.They provided refreshing lemonade, and soft drinks or iced tea or coffee too.Desert was a very nice apple cobbler.We appreciated their bottled water.Their service was attentive and efficient.The National Oregon / California Trail Center provided an educational and entertaining talk about the Oregon trail.It was sobering to learn that 18% of the intrepid pioneers never made it in their quest for free land.Also, the financial cost was very high at USD1200 to USD1500 to fund provisions for a wagon trail ride from Independence, Missouri to the Oregon Trail for 6 persons, when the average annual wage was only USD150 back then.It was heartrending to hear of parents staying back with a dying child, whilst the rest of their children were sent ahead with the wagon train.There is a small gift shop for souvenirs.There are also beautiful quilts and paintings displayed throughout, for sale.Recommended for the locals and overseas visitors to stop at Montpelier (Clover Creek), IDAHO for lunch, and soak in the historical value in learning more about the brave pioneers who travelled on the 1850's Wagon Train, to the West.Helen LimSingapore

You need to pay if you desire beer to go with your dinner.The cowboy music is familiar favourite tunes to one and all.We were impressed with their musical skills, especially the guitarist who strummed at lightning speed.They sang well, and in wonderful harmony.Highly recommended for the food and entertainment.

But we upgraded to a Panaromic 2 queen-sized beds on the 57th floor with a fantastic night and day view of the strip. It was worth topping up USD45 per night for this memorable view from the room.It would be great if Encore at least provided the first 2 bottles of water free so that we do not need to immediately go out to buy water after check-in.One needs to pay the daily USD35 resort fee if you want room WiFi and phonecalls. Otherwise, you can get free WiFi from their lobby and casino area.Local calls are at USD1.25 only, for the first 30 mins.On the final night, our room was not made as their electronic panel erroneously activated the Do Not Disturb sign. All the room lighting and temperature are activated by an electronic console on the bedside table. The blinds are automatically drawn open, when all room lights are on.There is ample closet and drawer space.Encore needs to provide more socket outlets for us to charge our multiple hand-held devices.Request for higher floor rooms facing the strip, as the music from their famous night club is really noisy and thumping, into the wee hours of morning.Their hotel breakfast (from 7:30am to 11am) is at The Buffet at Wynn. Go early as we need to queue around 30 mins to an hour.Upon request, they allowed late check-out at 1pm.Their Concierge counter closes at 9pm.You need to show the room card key to the security guy especially at night, so ask for the number of card keys corresponding to the number of people staying in the room.Encore's casino area is smaller than the Wynn, but adequate.Highly recommended hotel if you are hankering after an elegant hotel stay, at the Las Vegas strip.

Nevertheless, they remembered to e-mail me a PDF copy of my invoice, 3 days later.One is only 6 mins walk away from Lennox Square, a high-end shopping mall which has many shopping and dining options.For breakfast, you can also walk 2 mins to a corner breakfast cafe (great breakfast sandwiches), which is located to the right of their driveway.A further 2 mins walk past this breakfast cafe is the MARTA train station. On a first come first serve basis, you can take their Tesla house car to destinations within a 2 mile radius. Of course, a tip to their driver will be welcomed.On the way back to the Atlanta airport, we took the MARTA train at USD3.50 only, per person.We highly recommend this excellent hotel for businessmen and even for leisure travellers who appreciate an exclusive hotel stay and sublime experience at Atlanta.Helen LimSingapore

He is an extremely safe driver, and we appreciated him getting us back to our hotel safely, although it was already past 1am.Indeed, Alfonso is the epitome of a perfect, knowlegeable and gentlemanly guide, who will help take your priceless Kodak moment shots.This is one of the few tours which provides a picnic experience (you get to choose your own sanwiches) and fresh fruits. We enjoyed sharing our picnic with some squirrels. They provide free flow of bottled water.But do buy some snacks at the gas-station stop, since the picnic lunch is only at 4pm for the Summer Grand Canyon National Park South Rim Sun-Set tours.If you are still hesitating / researching, go ahead and book with this professional tour company which offers a more intimate, relax and cosy small group experience of the Grand Canyon, for visitors.This is also the only day tour which accords us the privilege to spend around 4.5 hours at the Grand Canyon.We certainly experienced the reasons why Grand Adventures Tour is number 1 on TripAdivisor. So go ahead with it too.As an unforgettable added bonus, Alfonso even stopped beside a highway stop for us to witness the stupendous Milky Way, and stars and planets which were out in full impressive force.The van is still comfortable and efficient for the 800 kilometers road trip.Helen Lim Singapore

Around USD24 each. They even sell Dog T-shirts with this iconic angel wing design, and doggy throw toys as well.We also got the eye-catching AMC's USD45 Negan's Lucille baseball bat, which is an infamous and terrifying instrument of death, from Season 7.We heard excited remarks (and even 1 query on the price) from passerbys, when walking around Main Street with Lucille baseball bat.We had to buy the USD22 The Walking Dead Chronicles (The Official Companion Book) printed in the USA, and making a priceless souvenir of the pilot Season 1.They are well-stocked, and also sell mugs, bags, fleece throws, fridge magnets, mouse pads, jewellery and dog tags with shell casings from the show etc.A must visit, to at least buy a memento or more (go ahead and treat yourself / your kids) to appreciated keep-sake of your favourite TV series.After you have already paid for your merchandise, you may proceed downstairs to their TWD museum, whereby you can take pictures with sets of the jail cell, from the prison.Helen LimSingapore

We chose soft delicious brioche bun.Their accompanying sides of asparagus, fries and onion rings were also scrumptious too. I enjoyed the sweet and crunchy onion rings.We took away their massive burgers, and enjoyed lunch on one of the metal benches along cosy and quaint Main Street.Their friendly counter staff kindly assisted with our orders, which took around 15 minutes before collection.We went on a Saturday, and did not get a chance to see any film crew from TWD.Still, a highly recommended restaurant with generous portions at wallet friendly prices, and especially enjoyed if one is a TWD fan.Helen LimSingapore

Clyde is a very friendly, patient and we appreciated his excellent safe driving skills, while he spent his whole day with us. He is crafty too, and we were impressed with his handmade realistic Lucille bat.We were driven to their downtown office where fans can buy some TWD souvenirs and merchandise.Zombie 1 was conducted by Charlie who is an experienced 'walker', and he is a wealth of information about the various filming sites of not just TWD, but other movies filmed around downtown Atlanta as well. We were kept fascinated by all the interesting facts and figures that Charlie generously shared about the iconic filming locations and important movie industry in Georgia. We saw the "CDC" centre, Terminus, bridge and highway which Rick went on his horse etc.Thereafter, we went to Senoia which is around 50 mins drive away. This was the Big Zombie 2 and 3 combo, and we saw the filming sites of Woodbury and Alexandria. We also went to Griffin.We were very pleased to meet Stephanie who is also an experienced 'walker' on 5 seasons, having appeared in 20 episodes. We were intrigued as informative Stephanie shared experiences and trivia with us. We hope she gets to appear more in Season 8, and subsequent TWD episodes too.We felt special as we had 'VIP' access to the arena (whereby brothers Meerle and Daryl were forced by the Governor to fight) and Morgan's apartment.We were pressed for time and did a custom combo of Big Zombie 1, 2 & 3 within a day, but it was still a complete and comprehensive private TWD tour experience.Both Charlie and Stephanie kindly answered all our questions, and generously shared their insider experiences.We have a new-found respect for extras, and their hard work and passion.Having planned for our trip 4 months beforehand, we note that there are a few tours to choose from, but in terms of professional service and responsiveness, Atlanta Movie Tours takes the cake and is simply top-notch and befitting of 5 stars (and much more).This is a comfortably-paced tour which does not require much walking. Our airconditioned transport provided welcomed cool respite from the scorching summer heat and relentless sunrays.If you are still checking out which tour company to choose, do NOT hesitate to go with Atlanta Movie Tours, as we highly recommend them, and we could not have found a better tour company.This is well worth your time and money, and you will enjoy these 3 Big Zombie tours if you are a The Walking Dead fan. It is a priceless and satisfying experience to see firsthand, where memorable scenes of your favourite TV and movies are filmed.You may also go for their Victory tour if you a Hunger Games fan.Atlanta Movie Tours is likely one of the Best TV and film tours around the world, for TV and movie buffs.We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.Definitely NOT to be missed, when one is in Atlanta / Georgia (the new entertaiment capital) please.Helen LimSingapore

This Cedele Bakery Cafe outlet at MBFC Tower 3 offers a delicious range of bread, cakes, pies, sandwiches, salads and soup.Out of all their scrumptious cake offering, I particularly dig their decadent dessert carrot cake (western ang moh style) which is moist yet fluffy, and not cloyingly sweet or rich like other types of cake. Their cake slice is of generous portion, and ideal for sharing.My friend had their rosemary chicken sandwich and soup set which is reasonably priced at around SGD13, and presents a satisfying yet healthy lunch. Her small soup was hearty with big chunks of ingredients.I had their artesanally crafted pulled beef sandwiche on ciabatta bread, with succulent and substantial slow-cooked tender pulled beef. Handsdown, one of the best gourmet sandwiches I have ever had in Singapore. You can choose from a few types of bread.My friend's long-black coffee looked and smelt good.Highly recommended if you hanker after consistently great quality and healthy cafe fare at wallet-friendly prices, and are pressed for time. Their service is extremely efficient, although hectic with the lunch-time crowd.There is also a queue for takeaways.I have bought their whole cakes before (carrot cake and velvet cake) which were well received.

You can also top up for onion rings instead.It was an interesting experience to enjoy burgers before 9am, and I certainly do not mind such an early treat again since I am a huge burger fan.Their french fries were also freshly deep fried, and served in generous portions.We appreciate that their burgers are cooked to order, and not sitting outside based on en masse cooking beforehand.The Kuala Lumpur International Airport Burger King outlet is located at Terminal 1, at Level 3 of the Arrival hall of main terminal building.

It was bustling, even on a Tuesday night.We had their chilli crab and 'kum heong' crab baked with dried shrimp, minced garlic and curry leaves, which were great.The assam style prawn was delicious.Broccoli with beancurd and mushroom was good.Sliced bittergourd with salted egg was also enjoyed.Their huge steamed white pomfret was fresh, meaty, tender, and promptly devoured.The crispy lemon chicken (boneless) was passable, although a popular dish.The 'wok hei' of their fried rice was so good that we ordered seconds.Service is efficient, but be prepared not to experience friendly service.We sat outside, and enjoyed the metal roof retracting away to show the night sky, later on during our alfresco meal.

We all had a blast in handcrafting a flat disc into a small pewter bowl using time-honoured tools and methods, although it was no easy task. We took pride in our handicraft, although they were all far from perfect.We also got to take home the apron and a certificate too.We have a new-found respect for their craftsmen and women as we realize the hard work, sweat, skill, training and muscle strength needed in crafting the various masterpiece (entirely by hand), and knocking out the hundreds of dimples on a pewter vase or a mug.We were particularly impressed with an aunty who has muscled arms from hammering out consistent dimples on her ware.Highly recommended attraction, especially to pay for the enjoyable craft workshop, so as to bring home your own pewter 'masterpiece".

The restaurant obviously gets busy, so it's probably best to book in advance and maybe request a quiet table, as some in the middle of the restaurant seem a little confined for space.The food was very good, and plentiful. The ice cream desserts were particularly impressive & delicious. There's also a well stocked wine list.All in all, the popular Casa Bella is well recommended, as it wouldn't disappoint you.

The musical stones of Skiddaw being especially fascinating, both in their background and the fact that visitors get to try a tune on the stones!

Similarly with the main courses - well cooked, mouth watering dishes. Add tasty local wines and gorgeous desserts, it all added to a great way to spend my birthday. I'd love to return to the taverna as soon as I can.

The array of plant life is pretty astounding and the place is obviously well staffed & well run.If I could offer one suggestion for improvement, it would be for the maps & signage as they can be a bit confusing & unclear.

Absolute ripoff, which bears no comparison to the theme parks in the USA. There are simply far too many people allowed in at any one time, and the queues for rides/attractions are just plain ridiculous. It's very uncomfortable and is sheer exploitation by the owning body. I wish I'd spent the entrance money on something far more useful. Attend if you enjoy being crammed into an area, and having to pay heavily for the privilege!Wouldn't return there if I was paid to do so.

Unfortunately, the best part of the dining experience was the dessert - delicious ice cream! The fish my wife ordered seemed fine, but my choice of sirloin steak was a poor one - it was tough & pretty much tasteless. It wasn't particularly decently priced either. On top of this, the service was poor as we literally had to leave the table more than once to attract the attention of a server, despite the fact that we were seated in the main body of the restaurant. No return visits here, I'm afraid.

He filletted our sea bass, at the table, patiently & professionally, and was happy to engage in conversation too. He kindly produced glasses of limoncello at the end of the meal, on the house, something that we encountered in only one other restaurant in the town. Whilst we were there, it was clear that there were a lot of repeat diners, so it must be a popular restaurant. Enjoyed our visit.

The food and drinks are very good, and I doubt anyone would be disappointed with them. The prices are slightly higher than other restaurants in the area. The service is efficient, without being especially affable. For instance, when we enquired if we could have a table which was empty, by the window, we were told that it was reserved. No one actually turned up to take it! Not a particularly nice touch, hence the deduction of one star. Perhaps this aspect of the service could receive some attention. Food very good, but a definite lack of atmosphere.

The menu is extensive, competitively priced, with a fine selection of quality wines. The restaurant is comfortable & atmospheric. The food is delicious and I'd particularly recommend the beef fillet, and the beef cuts with porcini mushrooms. Desserts too are excellent, especially the meringue pie. Service is friendly, cheerful and efficient, and there are plenty of staff. All in all, La Plume is an excellent restaurant.

It's a little more pricey than other restaurants in the area, but this fact is more than compensated by the quality of the food and service. In this regard, I'd thoroughly recommend the black pudding for starters, and the Steak Diane, which was mouthwatering.

We only had breakfast there, but it was certainly adequate, if unspectacular. The pool area was busy and could have done with more shaded areas. The staff at reception were helpful & friendly, though one or two others weren't so affable. I found the main problems in the bedrooms. Ours was very dated, with stained walls and carpet, and with basically not much room. The air conditioning was a joke, in that it was like an old fashioned radiator, floor standing, with a broken grill and temperature control. The heat in the room was ridiculous, though the temperature control dial was fixed by a technician on our second day. A bit more care and attention to basic facilities would enhance this hotel considerably.

Air conditioning is good, which is essential in the excessive heat in August, and rooms + corridors bright + airy. The entertainment is what you would expect, and was popular with guests generally. The hotel is rather isolated and there are no alternatives within walking distance, which can be a bind if staying for long. The toilets in the pool area are pretty poor, and definitely require attention -- no hand washing facilities and paper towels. Beds are hard and only one long, narrow pillow provided. When extra pillows were requested, it was accepted, but they never actually arrived! Also, it would be helpful if one or two of the bar/catering staff could understand English.A little bit more attention would improve the hotel overall.

It is also excellent value for money, as everything is reasonably priced, including toys etc in the gift shop. There is an indoor play area for younger children, as well as plenty of outside activities. The little train is really quaint too, and well worth the trip. Another big plus is the friendliness of the staff. All of them, both young and not so young, are a credit to the place and obviously enjoy their work.

The service is a little confusing - slow & poorly coordinated, while there is a very attentive & caring administrator, although the waiters seem to be quite bored, gloomy and not motivated at all. Pizza is nice but depends which one. same with salads. Portions from the main menu are quite big, so the prices become reasonable. In conclusion - average, quite tasty, quite reasonable. Business lunch recommended - all the rest - find the administrator first)))) I believe one day this place could grow into a really great one. Average today, but not too bad for its range compared to the neighbourhood.

Founded it staying at Holiday Inn Suschevsky and that was a real treasure for my Chinesse & Indian tourists. Now that I go there for business lunches I see that most of russians from the office neighbourhood has discovered and appreciated this really nice place. Maybe because of the the atmospherical interior, music, smell & peacefulness - so you get into an island of rest escaping from the office, maybe because of the reasonable price & quality, and simplicity - but this place is really recommended to visit once at Rizhskaya or staying at Holiday Inn.

I found my way there taking a HopOnHopOff. The Temple itself is "new", built in 2004 or something like this. But it is an extremely atmospherical place & it is a must visit, doesn't matter if you are keen on buddhism or not. Plenty of open areas to visit, very welcoming, very inspiring, very beautiful.

I went with my friend. And we both might confess it was beyond any expectations! A beautiful historical mansion (even a palace), a great reception with welcome drinks, photographers and activities, a really interesting tour around the beautifull mansion. pieces f art in every room, stunning sculptures, pictures, antique furnitures... so it gives you a touch of a historical adventure - to feel what was it like in 18-19 century to come to a nobel family for a special evening concert))) And thats what they do. After the tour we were invited to the hall to enjoy the concert. But it's a very chamber concert, and that makes a difference! Not too much people, and it feels like you are in a right community surrounded by very nice people. What we also liked is that it was a mix of classical music & opera, it was dynamic and fresh, especially when a 14-aged genius piano player was invited to the stage - it was something unbelievable, that took my breath away! What I also liked is that before every song or play they give you a short introduction - the presenter speaks both english & russian, providing really interesting facts about the composers & their art. And the way he does it, and the way the whole team treats you during the whole evening is very special - it feels like they pay attention to every single guest, and we really appreciated that. So once you are in St Petersburg I do highly recommend you to visit Russian Music Seasons!P.s. a perfect location, you way safely walk around or call an Uber to this place. 5 min away from a very nice restaurant area, that suits perfectly well to complete an amazing evening!

Problems with food.”|review_453183992|have just had a dinner there in a group of 5 people. we were really disappointed. I thought its impossible to make asian food untasty. But... Some points of this menu really are. Dont ask for Tom Yam or Coconut soup - just dont. You will get WATER - yes, a lil bit coloured water, but not the real soup. Better take dim sums - these yes, are nice. Rolls - well, some were good, some others - not. but in general rolls are ok. second dish - ok, but again - not the taste you expect. not at all. tiger prawns were beautifull, but a bit uncooked. grilled salmon was supposed to come with tuna garnish - came without tuna. the explanation - "sorry, the menu has changed. english version is old version." They hardly speak english and hardly understand spanish. Brought us duck instead of chicken.were trying to give us dishes that we didnot ask for...At least they tried to understand. At least they gave us a lot og hot water for the tea. By the way the tea was firstly very poor too - couple of leaves inside the kattel. sounded like water. we asked to add more leaves. they did.so... we entered there because of a stunning design and a stunning atmosphere. We left quite unhappy. have spent 140 EUR for 5 people, but we could have spent this money much better in another place. :(

So if you are here - ask for steak with Ribera del Duero - you will love it for sure! Havent still found the sauna, but I'm here for another 2 days so i hope to find it. Stuff - very friendly, houskeeping works perefctly well. And yes, the reception made me check in earlier normal time - that was the biggest gift after a long flight, I appreciated it. And yes, the freee of charge shuttle from the airport was really great. Great car, great driver. Just it took me about 20 min to find the station (its just at the end of Terminal one), but the airport stuff couldnot help me to find it. While Tripadvisor did help in this case :) the only 2 points that I'd recommend to improve are:- would be great to have a kettle in the room. for hot water.- would be great to find the map of the free shuttle staion on your website. For the rest - thank you very much! Great location if you come for the fair! Previous years we stayed closer to Puerta del Sol, but we were wrong. City center hotels are for tourists, if you come for IFEMA - pullman the best. We forgot what does it mean traffic jams & extra taxi costs. It's just 4 minutes walking. Saves your time in the morning - you can sleep more before work) Thats fabulous)

Room small out of date and over priced.. but ok for sleep over. For an extra $20 I should of stayed at Novotel..Anyway check out was easy.. but same thing , uniforms are filthy. On all staff..I don't understand how a thing like a clean uniform can be a priority. Wifi fast .. close to shops and local food..And I almost forgot when we arrive the porters to busy on there phones to do there job..we did it ourselves thank for nothing :.Would I stay here again.. definitely not.

They upgraded me to a bigger room that I had to pay for and I just stayed the 1 night.. I've traveled all through Asia and have never come across this ever.. Hotel.com refunded my money when I returned to Aust, which was good but as for the hotel it's just not worth it. I can see even now that people are still complaining about the check in time. They told me they where going to fix on website. Looks like they have not yet people are still complaining. I'll be coming back to Taipei 2 more times this year and I won't be staying here.

Ok saved some money for tipping I guess, well I walked into room it stunk of mould there was water all through the walls and I could not stay in here for a second more, so I called desk and told them the problem, they called up in 5mins said manager on way to upgrade room,that was ok , but why rent that room out the wallpaper was full of water and the room was so musty it was just unliveable, so anyway the new upgraded room ok but still same smell in it, there's no bar and the worst buffet I have ever eaten in my life, there's buses and buses of rude mainland Chinese coming and going and it's just not worth it, please don't bother how cheap it is, it's not worth your health, just turn and run, stay on bench at airport better for you .

Anyway I arrived early at 12 pm I know this is early but I had late night the day before and I travel by train for few hours, so I was tired. The ladies on the desk didn't seem to interested in my problem and there English was very poor. Anyway after a few coffees I went back and typed in my translation app is there any upgrades I could purchase, which there was I paid an extra 1250 NT for the 2 nights, then waited 10 mins and my room was ready. Well the room is like a prison cell you can't open the curtains because there are 13 story apartment block right next door and people can see right in. The bathroom is very small that is ok but when you go to the toilet you can't put any paper in the bowl they say that the paper can not dissolve so put in sanitary bins!!! Ok.....Any the bed is really good and the room very basic. You can actually buy whatever you want in the room from the kettle to the emergency flash light. If you can't speak Chinese you will have trouble using remote control ( which you can buy) to the air conditioning unit. On the positives the night staff went out there way to help me, and always smiling. Would I stay here again, that is a big No, but if your here just for Markets and bit shopping it's ok.Sorry I hate giving bad reviews but I say it as I see it .

Being a chef myself for over 30 years I just love the food here, my partner and I tried everything from chilli frog to black pepper snails, the beer is cheap the atmosphere is typical KL, yes it kinda smells of seafood, but it's not a terrible smell it's food !!! If travelling you can eat at western style foods anywhere, my advice is be brave do it, it's so much fun, there are some great singers that walk,crawl and being pushed up the streets with great voices, give the a few rm they work so hard all night.People will come up selling laser pointer and wooden baskets you just say no or yes if you want to buy, they just take it in there stride and walk away and won't keep hassling you like other countries... If your a true foodie you will love this place, I did

Check in was standard like any hotel and was quick and efficient, but when we got to our room there was something wrong with the power so they moved us to a bigger room on the same side we requested to be on the less noisy side, which was fine, things happen.The room it self was ok not over the top just right, the wifi was good,the view was ok, overall it's just your run of the mill apartment.The bed was very comfy pillows excellent,the bathroom it has some minor design hiccups but nothing to bad, the house keeping could do with a little more training, but other than that, all good.As for location, it fits right in, 10min walk to pavilion, and all good shopping areas, and of course the famous night life and street food right at your door.The swimming pool and gym are at good standard.Overall a good standard place to stay ..

Came with family and friends to celebrate my 40th. Went on a Monday to avoid the weekend crowds. Was still busy, about 25-40 min wait for rides but got on some rides after no wait at all. Did not buy the express ticket and still went on every ride except Battlestar. Loved Transformers, Lost Rapids (Jurassic Park), Mummy and the Waterworld show. Tip: go on the rides when the Waterworld show is on, went on Lost Rapids twice with no wait. Not as big as Disneyland but still a great park.

After looking online we decided on Whitsunday Apartments due to the convenience of self-contained and the price. We treated ourselves to the deluxe coral sea view - the room was great, roomy and the view on the 11th floor was awesome! It was great that our room also included a daily mini service. Our room was already renovated, another 20 apartment bathrooms are going to be renovated over late Oct to early Dec. Staff were lovely, checkin was easy and the bus transfers from/to the airport are well organised. The Island Green shuttle runs directly to/from the apartments so there isn't a need to get a golf cart buggy at all. Looking forward to our return trip next year. Please don't put up the prices, these apartments are a good priced option for those not able to spend $500 to $1700 a night elsewhere on the island!

We had hired a car to get around and having the covered carport near your rooms was very handy. We always try to pick self-contained when we travel and Frangipani was great, beautiful tropical gardens, loved the outdoor shower. Our room was very private and I spent many hours relaxing on the day bed reading. The WiFi connection was awesome. Pools only open to 6pm but the famous Cable beach is open 24/7. The rooms don't have an oven but they all have their own Weber bbq's which we used most nights. Town bus right outside which was great for the return trip to Matsos - $4 each way. You can easily walk the 15 mins to Cable Beach but having the car was great for swimming each day. Only disappointing event for us was the 'wet season' hit during our stay but it was lovely to hear the Lightning/thunder. General Manager was fantastic in helping us locate some missing items, unfortunately we did not locate them but Daniel went over and above to help me after we had checked out. Looking forward to returning to Frangipani sometime next year as we were unable to go on our day trip due to the weather/road closures. Definitely recommend.

We were on a non-smoking floor which was appreciated. Staff are friendly and the concierge desk offers great discounts for regular tours. Rooms were clean, gym and pool were adequate for our stay. Lobby bar offers happy hour drinks which you can also get an hour of wifi included. Hotel is good walking distance to Raffles, Marina Bay and 250m from an MRT to access Orchard Rd and Gardens by the Bay. Great stay, look forward to returning.

The whole day, which began with the bus picking us up at 6:15am, cruise out to Day Dream Island for a full buffet breakfast and a quick look around before meeting our tour guide at 9am. Our tour guide was amazing, full of interesting facts and information. The highlight of Day Dream was feeding the fish at Lovers Cove. The boat picked us up at 11 to head to Hamilton Island. Lunch at the Marina Tavern was included in our package and the staff and food were lovely. After a wander around the main strip, we caught the next boat out to Whitehaven Beach at 1pm. Whitehaven was so pretty, with gorgeous white sands and warm water to relax in. On the trip home a light afternoon tea was served. All staff on this trip were beyond exceptional with their friendliness and helpfulness. I would recommend Cruise Whitsunday to anyone wanting a memorable friendly trip.

I visited my tour costumers at the hotel and I inform the reception that around 3.30pm. there will be the bus arrive to take the guest for the trip. I just inform the reception team to call up to there rooms to inform the guest when the bus come. One guy from reception ask me that is the guest know the pick up time ? I said yes. And he said "so they guests have to know themselves and be ready by the time because normally Arabic guests are always be late". And he continue said that "but if u want us to call we will call" I was shock why he said like this. He is maybe tired from his work and split that out or he might has stereotype that all Arabic guests are always no need to be a good take care. I told him if this make you too busy so you dont need to call. And i am really shock with his manner. I know this is 3 stars hotel with no need a good service but i dont ask any 5 stars service just to call to inform guest. About they will be ready or not is not his business. The reception job task is to inform the guest when someone come to contact. If management can read this, please improve your staff skills. It dont need a 5 stars but it's need Skills. Your team is very lack of the service skills.

The treatment room is very quiet but you still can hear the natural sound from the insect outside which makes you more relaxing. There are couple rooms and couple price available. Moreover, there are close rooms and the couple open air room on the rooftop with private pool which you can see panorama view of Kata beach down from the mountain. It's very hard to find a spa room with the open air view like this. The professional of the therapist is very perfect. I tried the Thai herbal ball massage mix with deep tissue technique which is good for an office syndrome problem. I absolutely recommend Oasis Spa for anyone who seeking a real spa, relaxing time or release your tiredness after many trips in Phuket. The advance reservation is recommended as they seem always busy; however, there is a transportation service from many particular areas in Phuket. The best spa I recommend in Kata Beach.

There is a food court which is various kind of food down near the lobby.The room seems little small, but it's very good if compare with the price. So this I recommend. However, as this hotel is quite popular, so the rooms are always used that can effect of bad smell, not that feel fresh much in the room. The window glass cannot open. The housekeeping tried to put the fresh air spray for me but it's still bad smell. However, it's ok with the price. Wifi is super fast at the lobby area, and on the floor, however in the room seems too weak of the signal. It does not work well on the bed.I recommend this hotel for all who like the convinence style with the good price and you can save money to enjoy the Singapore.

The price is very good, the staffs were so nice. It's new hotel with nice, clean, and modern decoration. The room facilities are set better than some 4 stars hotel. However, it's still far by walk to Emirate Mall. If you travel in Dubai and using the car, this hotel is the good choice. I love the decoration. The only problem of this and management should fix it is about the Lift Key Card Access. It's very goos system to use the room key card to access to lift to go up floor to the guest room, somehow, many times the key card is does not work with some elevator properly.

I took from Emirate Mall to Dubai Mall around 30 mins.The station of Dubai mall to the Dubai Mall building is too far ,so you have to walk around 10-15 minutes. However, it's nice and easy.

The lady name Kate at the reception was amazing to help me with everything. I checked in on my Birthday, and she does not forget the see passport and say "Happy Birthday" to me. The room was nice, clean but just it's noisy a bit from the construction site of the next to building. The next day I asked Ms.Kate to change the room to another site if there is other room available. she gave me the very nice room from another site which is am really appreciate this. It made my overall stay are so amazing from her help. The location is nice just you have to walk a bit to the Marina Mall, or The Walk at JBR Beach. It's quite far from me to walk every day, but it's still can walk. There is the Tesco Supermarket and coffee shop near the hotel which are convenience for some small lunch and any stuff. There are also many free parking slots in this hotel.The Housekeeping was nice also to call direct to the room in case if you put the"No Disturb" signal asking that what time you want to clean the room. I love it. The Bell Man all are nice service, ready to help and always say hi friendly to you. The thing I would like to suggest is about the the time of services which is still slow if compare with the total room guests, type and space of the hotel. It can be faster than this for better guest satisfaction.

I booked this Hotel for my Bahrain friends for 2 different room, but there was a problem about the booking. The reservation team name Aon did a very very good help for me and my friends. That's what i want to give her the compliment. The room was very good by decoration, but the room size is very small. It's okay for the teenager who loves to enjoy night life, but I am not suggest for a relaxing couple. However, I really like the Restaurant down, near the lobby. That was nice, with 24hrs opening. Politely staff, and clean food. The most popular here is The fresh Sandwich. The Hotel staffs were nice, but please improve more smiley face, and service mind, if you can. However, there service performance was good. I really suggest this hotel for a couple or friends who really not much staying in room because the room was small and noisy from the road. This hotel is great by the location which is near the local Market which is open everyday until 11pm., 1min from Shopping mall, 3 min from Bangla road. You wont disappointed with this hotel.

She makes me feel I AM AT MY HOME. Please keep doing this friendly service. I suggest this Hotel for teenager, or anyone who love night life at Patong. It's not far from Bangla road. 1min to Shopping Mall. Everything you can easily find from here. However, it wont be a good choice for the on who need Sleeping time because it's quiet noisy from the Street, and Boxing Stadium. The best here is Staff service Performance, it was a small Hotel but great and friendly Service. I would like to give compliment for Two Night Receptionist Boys. I cant remember their name but they are friendly with good service mind. My friends got accident with the motorbike, and they were willing to help us with the smiley face. That's make me love here.

I am the one who choose this hotel for them, and they told me that everything there was amazing, friendly staffs, nice services, god restaurant, and overall was nice. However, all good things were destroyed by only one stupid policy which is Extra Person policy. This hotel is not allowed LADYBOY, or TRANSEXUAL to get in hotel area as a guest. That was very shock.It was one day around 4 o'clock evening, my friends invited me to join the party; suddenly the receptionist told me that LADYBOY is not allowed. I was shocked and asked her WHY? She said it’s a hotel POLICY, and explain more that ladyboy always make problems for the guest. I told her they are my friends and I am not a prostitute. She can’t say anything just ignore me.I would like to ask the BOARD or General Manager if you have, what is the reason for this policy? It can be accepted that many local ladyboy did bad things, but it does not mean all LADYBOY will do the same. Can you please just differentiate, and make Critical Thinking with this policy. I went there at 4 o'clock evening with a long jeans and proper T-Shirt, that’s not make sense to see me as a prostitute. You can block specific for person who makes problem by making the name list, but you can’t do this with all by STERYOTYPE.For anybody who is looking for a good Hotel in Patong Beach, if you have friends or you are planning to have a friend here as a ladyboy; I am not suggest this Hotel. Whatever, if GM of this hotel can read this review, I would like to say that I am not suggest any Foreigners friends any more to stay at your Hotel, if you still has this unreasonable Policy. If you would like to be an International hotel, check carefully this Policy because it can cross with the term of World Human Rights as Discrimination issue.

On the site said Room with Breakfast, but during i stayed here, the receptionist said to me my booking is no breakfast included, i should pay more. She also said it maybe the problem with Sale Department. I understand, and dont want to complain with her because i know she tried her best in work. But the problem between Sale and Agency should not be my problem, or i should not know about this. It's not my business. So please makes sure and fix this problem.

This restaurant is located on the main road in patong and is just behind the small sea food stalls.It is worth searching this restaurant as it provides the best Indian food. the prices are very reasonable and the food quality is uncompromised. Best in taste and quality. We stayed in phuket for 3 days and we ordered each and every meal(lunch and dinner) from this restaurant only. It provides delivery at your hotel too. It had the best indian food i had during the whole Thailand trip. Suggesting the restaurant for the Indian main course meals.

It is quite a old hotel but it seems all the rooms are refurbished and almost seems new. Beds are comfortable and rooms are spacious. Good aircon in room. All the room lights and aircon buttons are touch sensitive which seems to be a nice feature. Washrooms are quite OK and have all necessary required things available. The best part is the Various india food options available around the hotel area. Being an Indian vegetarian, it was nice to have various pure vegetarian indian restaurants available round the clock (morning 7 to midnight 12). There are also several cheap shopping options available around the hotel. Also indra square mall is just below the hotel that provides several shopping options(bargain is must). Hotel travel desk is very good. You can expect to get cheapest deals on the travel desk itself without going to any other travel agent. Breakfast was having less vegetarian options inspite of having decent number of indian guests. Overall rating is good and will definetly vist this hotel again in next visit to bangkok. Only drawback in this hotel is paid wifi.

Perfect Holidays.”|review_346757477|After reading some negative reviews about this place on trip-advisor , I was quite doubtful about booking my stay here. But considering the brand value of Le Meridian, I took my chance here. I stayed here for 7 Days and my stay was absolutely perfect. There are lot many activities to do within the resort only and We didn't get bored even after 7 days. The room was excellent (was upgraded to Nirvana Section). The pools were good and the beach was awesome. Being an Indian vegetarian and a foodie the best thing I like here is food. Got complete variety of vegetarian breakfast and dinner at Cumin and it taste awesome. Not a Single day the dishes were repeated. I really have to comment that I didn't find such good Indian Restaurant anywhere else outside India. Special thanks to Chef Khan for all their hospitality and wonderful dinners we had at cumin. Thinking back about my stay here, I can't find single point of improvement. Everything was so perfect. Also, special thanks to the room service staff (specially Shibani) for keeping the rooms perfect. You guys did a wonderful job. For moving around Mauritius, you can hire a personal scooter/car and that is available at the resort's travel desk itself. Also, you can hire Taxi which is available all the time at the taxi stand just opposite to the resort main gate.Also, a few shops are nearby resort for buying light snacks and water etc.I will definitely prefer to stay at this place again whenever in Mauritius.

We are happy as we found authentic dimsum without having to drive all the way downtown into Chicago or Chinatown. MingHin is a stand-alone building with ample on-site parking. The building is very new and has a sort of Japanese-zen type of feel to it. The food service was very quick, food very tasty and good (as normal with dim-sum places they have a few dishes they do very well and maybe one or two you prefer at another place). Here their BBQ pork was not quite to my preference, but still decent. Everything else was excellent.For those new to eating Chinese dim-sum the experience is a bit different than a regular restaurant. You are not going to get super friendly (on the outside) or chatty servers, but they are efficient. They are not going to announce the name of each dish as they bring it (you are suppose to know this - they do look like the pictures in the menu though); and each dish will come out as it is ready (not all together or in a preset order) and if they don't have the sauces you want on the table just ask for it.Overall location in the burbs is great, service was fast, food was good and price was pretty reasonable (for dim-sum). We will be going again!!

Their happy hour pricing started at 4 pm. This meant the place wasn't very crowded and we were able to order their "house" oysters (East Coast or West Coast options) for half-price.The Oyster Bar is very old-style Chicago with lots of dark wood, old Chicago art/posters on the walls, white-shirted waiters, etc. It was very cozy, though with a pretty good decent capacity and mostly high tables. While we were there they had a combination of older couples, friends eating out, date-night couples, and a couple families.The food was great. I had the crab cakes (very large crab cake, fries, decent salad) and clam chowder (which was great, thick, tasty). My wife had the oysters and soup and loved it as well. The front staff (host/hostess) were very friendly and the waiter was good, but seemed to be a little rushed or perhaps over-loaded (or perhaps just his personality) but everything went smoothly. We would visit again next time we are around Michigan Avenue.

They have ample parking that is walking distance to the park entrance (no need for waiting around for trams, etc.). Of course if you arrive late on a very busy day you may get a longer walk from the back of the lot.Once you enter the park you are reminded of the Main Street USA of Disney Magic Kingdom (but smaller). I am told that this part of Adventureland was designed by the same folks who did Main Street Disney. Of course at Adventureland the area is a bit smaller, but they do have a train that goes around the park that boards from here and is a good way to get orientated to what is where.The park is basically divided into two parts (one admission price for both) - the original amusement park and the newer water park. You could spend all day at either one if you wanted. The amusement park has a collection of rides for small kids (toddlers, pre-school, K-1, etc.) school age kids and the adventure rides for big kids (and those who are kids at heart). They have the normal amusement park type of food with some smaller street options and a couple larger dining centers. They have the normal amusement park mark-ups as well. The nice thing about the park is they offer a picnic area right outside the main gate where a lot of families like to go back to their car to gather their food they brought along and eat it picnic style and then re-enter the park.At the park they also have some shows and entertainment which was ok, but nothing too great. The biggest draw I think to the park is that they have little for everyone and enough to keep everyone happy.

Hopefully once the street work in DeWitt is completed it will be a bit easier to pull into the place. It does seem a bit unfinished due to a gravel parking lot and plain appearance. The owners could probably greatly improve business with more visible signage and making it easier to see from the road if they are open or not.Once you get inside they have a small sitting area, bathroom, and counter area with some of the standard ice cream flavors but also some really interesting or different flavors. My daughter's favorite is the Superman flavor which is a bunch of different colors and tastes a bit like bubble gum I suppose. They can serve you the ice cream in a cone, cup, bowl, or as a shake, etc. Prices are not bad (but not what I would call cheap either).

I don't know if it was the staff or some of the folks in line ahead of me who couldn't decide what they wanted but the line sure didn't move very fast. I spent as much time in line as I did eating my food. If you have never been here before they operate using the subway sandwich method. You start indicating what basic meal you want (burrito, taco, etc.) and then choose your meat, what sauces you want, what additional items you want to add, if you want to add things like beans or nachos, or a drink, then you slide down the line, pick-up your food and pay, and take your tray and find a place to sit. The food, obviously, is not that authentic Mexican, but it did taste good and you can get it the way you want (within the confines of the options available). The place was clean, off-street parking was available (though could be crowded as it is shared with the other eating places in this block), and staff friendly enough (based on fast-food standards). A lot of take-out business as well. They just need to keep the line moving a bit better.

An hour or two would cover the visiting the entire site.The site itself is sort of shoe-horned into a piece of land between some one-way streets, railroad tracks a block away in another direction, and as a results has very limited parking. Best bet perhaps is to park across the street at the Stoney Creek Convention Center / Famous Dave parking lot if you can't find a spot at the Art Center (or can't figure out how to enter the parking area of the Art Center which isn't very obvious).

It has a decent sized parking lot that seems secure and is linked to their own convention center and a Famous Dave's restaurant on-site.When you walk in you get the impression of walking into a large, hunting type of lodge with the stuffed animal heads on the wall, a fireplace in the lobby, lots of wood paneling, timber logs, wilderness motif and items, etc. The rooms were the same way with even toilet paper roll holders looking like they were hacked out of a tree. Of course all of these decorations are actually plastic, etc. for decorative effect. In reality the rooms and facilities were top notch, the staff very friendly, a good breakfast, etc.

Thought I would save a few bucks compared to the Country Inn & Suites next door. Because of the development in the area I assume this block of hotels was built at roughly the save time, but the La Quinta Inn appears to show its age more. Everything worked and no problems with the facility itself, just nothing fancy. The hotel had an indoor pool which other families seemed to be enjoying.Check-in was smooth and quick. Upon arrival to my room the bathroom had a bit of an odor to it. Nothing real bad but sort of like it hadn't been used in a while. After a bit later in the evening the smell either went away or I got used to it. Decent bed, old style lighting and switches, efficient aircon that wasn't too loud, average bed, decent TV channels. Everything fine but nothing outstanding.My only real compliant was breakfast. It was advertised as breakfast included, however when I went downstairs for breakfast in the morning the breakfast "room" was really just an expanded check-in lobby and I had to look a little bit to find the "food". The breakfast consisted of make yourself waffles (not my favorite) a very small selection of bread and toaster, very horrible coffee in a 1950's style looking machine, and some yoghurt and hard boiled eggs (with apparently very hard shells from the antics of the other guests trying to break them open) and that was it. Protein sources were weak and beverages pretty watery all the way around. I have been to Super 8's and Day's Inn with better fare.Check-out was quick and accurate. Parking on site is adequate and well lighted. Overall nothing really "wrong" with the hotel (other than a weak breakfast) but nothing great either and for the small price difference there seem to be better hotels steps away.

The British built these stairs out of the rock to provide an escape route from some of the government installations in town in case of an attack, but never had to use them. Thus the historical aspect to them. From a local economy perspective you will be greeted at the bottom by a wide range of local trinket sellers and, thankfully, some food and cool refreshment vendors. As a main tourist draw the bottom can get a bit chaotic with the narrow winding streets and our group had a hard time finding our ride again at the bottom and making sure we got on the right vehicle (and did I mention it was HOT). If you are into local or colonial history the stairs have some interest and the neighborhood they are in is interesting. Not that scenic really, and actually a bit of a hassle I thought.

I will admit, prior to the visit, that I was not necessarily looking forward to stopping here part it was part of the overall agenda. However after the visit I was glad that we did stop here as I did learn some things about the history of Nassau and their culture as well, we all ended up enjoying the visit, and the host was very entertaining and mindful of our needs.Entering the place seems a bit sketchy as the van driver basically makes sure the "coast is clear" and departs the van to get the host. He unlocks a very well secured front door, escorts us in, and then locks the door behind us (not to keep us in but to avoid unwanted intruders - the nature of the beast in Nassau). They start with a history of Junkaroo and the Nassau, showing you some of the various costumes, etc. and then take you into another room where they show you how to make the costumes and music instruments and then lets everyone join in with the costumes and instruments to play/dance a song or two. Of course the best part for me was restrooms on sight, very good/cool air-conditioning and water/local drink provided !! Most importantly, as I mentioned, the host (the husband of one of the famous Junkanoo festival winners) was very happy to have us there, very polite, fun, and energetic host.

Couldn't beat the price at $5.99 for all you can eat salad bar, pizza, pasta, and includes soft drink. A good variety of pizza (though sometimes ran out but they were doing their best to keep up), and more limited pasta and salad bar choices (this is a smaller Pizza Hut). They had one waitress working the cash register and floor and she was keeping up with everyone, clearing plates and offering drink refills. Overall a great value, especially if you like Pizza Hut type of pizza.

However the service level dropped off from here and had to ask for drink refills and extra napkins (after the waiter had passed our table several times with empty glasses sitting on the table).Food was generally quite good, with the exception of the onion rings which were undercooked. The main dishes were very tasty. We paid via the on-table electronic monitor so that process was user-friendly and quick.

The location is EXCELLENT with the ability to walk to many shopping and easting options on Orchard (and many local eating options within the shopping center itself without needing to even step outside the building).DISCLAIMER: These apartments are more like and upgraded HDB flat style versus a modern, western, luxury hotel or serviced apartment type. Don't expect a fancy lobby, daily maid service (maid service is about 3x per week), or such. They do have a great pool (bring your own towels), tennis courts and roof-top green area.Our room featured a separate bathroom with stand-up shower (great water pressure), small wall-mounted sink and toilet. It has a switch on the wall to turn on and off the water heater for the room. The kitchen/dining room featured a wood floor, cabinets and storage shelves, modern microwave, sink, gas stove top/hob, electric kettle, toaster and assorted dishes and pots and pans. It also included a combination clothes washer dryer and a fridge/freezer. The living room (actually continuation of the dining room/kitchen area) has a throw rug, coach, coffee table, and tv cabinet and decent sized flat screen TV. There are two carpeted bedrooms with large wardrobes and a deck (you can access from a door in the main bedroom or sliding glass door in living room) where you can place the clothes drying rack or just stand to enjoy the views.Check-in and check-out is more like going to a leasing office versus a hotel style check-in and out and they require a deposit (on your credit card). As I mentioned maid service comes a few times a week. They also provide a android cell phone with free local service, and free calls to a few select countries including Australia and local Asia countries.If you are used to local Singapore accommodations this is a great place to stay, great value and excellent location. If you are looking for luxury style, high-end western hotel style furnishings then you will prefer the other more upscale serviced apartments (and pay a much higher premium for such). For us (and our young daughter) it worked very well and we will stay here again.

The only reason we got something to eat here was because of our daughter's request. Over the years I have stopped here a few times and try to avoid it with a passion now as they always have long lines and their service (turn-around-time) is very, very, very slow. Did I say slow? Friendly service isn't to be found here either.This McDonalds is located in a strip of eating outlets inside the departure area of the Hong Kong airport and shares a common seating area.

The park is small so you transit from neighborhood to neighborhood fairly quickly. The backdrops, sets, and street dressing are done well (but due to the smaller size can look a bit odd when you can see the next neighborhood right in the background of the current one).We went on a weekday (hours 10 am to 6 pm I believe). The entry process was fairly smooth and there wasn't much of a rush at 10:15 when we go to the gate. There are many options for purchasing tickets (try to do it on-line and print before you go if for no other reason to just make the process smoother). We had to find a kiosk selling tickets at the park and the signage was less than helpful (it was unclear where they were selling which tickets). Inside the park it was pretty easy (and almost no wait) to get on the rides or attractions for the first few hours. After 1 pm things started to get crowded. I can only image what a weekend may look like (especially Saturday which is the only day they have the character parade and evening fireworks). Food options in the park are pretty standard (fancy themed names for things, pretty bland, average food at pretty special or high prices).The different show timings were not well advertised (only at the spot of the show itself) and in their program it was unclear which shows would be street performances and which were inside proper facilities. The park also lacks a few rest areas (benches, cooling stations, etc.) that would make the experience more pleasant.Overall a pretty good experience and we had fun until our little one decided with the heat and jet lag they she had had enough and it was time to go home.

This is held in a lobby looking like area (to the side of the main hotel lobby) and is somewhat open to the lobby and an entry way door to the outside car drop area. The hostess was helpful to arrange a table for us and the experience started.First you select your tea (or coffee I understand) from a list of traditional and other flavored teas (black, green, etc.). You can opt to pay a surcharge to add champagne to the meal. Next comes the appetizer, a choice between a seafood (cavier, fish egg mix) or dim-sum. The dim sum option was tasty and much more substantial than the seafood choice. Next comes the "box" which has three drawers. The bottom drawer holds dips; the second drawer holds two types of scones, and the third drawer has the selection of main entre finger food (salmon on cracker, some sort of tuna sandwich, etc. All of which, of course, or very dainty and fancy looking, but not very substantial in terms of quantity or subsistence. On top of the "box" is the selection of bite-sized desserts. This was the most well represented selection and filling.Service was, let's say, average. For such an expensive meal, in a unique presentations (e.g. old English high tea), in a very upscale hotel, you would expect only the best service. However we experienced wait staff which forgot to bring the water we requested for my daughter (who became a little vocal when she realized everyone received their tea and she had nothing to drink); we had to request a third place setting with silverware after they only provided two though they seated three adults; and wait staff which delivered the food efficiently but really didn't make you feel welcome or really seemed to care if you were there or not.Overall a unique way to enjoy high tea (and the tea and food was good), but it was just way too little food, and average service for such a commanding price to make me want to "experience" that again.

They are located on the main drag through town (Main Street) with parking along the street. The appearance of the place is nothing fancy (inside or out), but the service is friendly, and the food is very good at an even better price. This is full-service restaurant (versus just a place with pub grub you find at many of these types of places).The place itself is divided into three areas: the restaurant dining area, bar/eating area, and a banquet type of room for larger crowds, events or live music on some nights. They offer different specials on different nights (Taco night, prime-rib night, fried fish night, etc.). Overall a good place to go to grab a quick lunch during the day, or a more social sit-down restaurant dining at night (or party/live music later in the night on weekends).

What I liked about this Starbucks is that it at least had an area that two or three people could stand with a counter at the window if you needed to kill some time. They also had wireless recharging spots and free attachments you could borrow (not take) to plug into your phone and then charge your phone a bit while you sipped some coffee. Granted like a lot of coffee places downtown there isn't much room to do more than walk in, get your coffee, and go, but it works.

Obviously the main drag being Michigan Avenue however the side streets have many nice eating places and other shops as well. Obviously you will be in a day of public transport and walking (or expensive downtown parking garages and walking) and no bargain discounts here. It is a nice change of pace for shopping (or what I do which is mostly sightsee) and you get to know your go-to spots to sit down and rest while having a coffee and which stores have restrooms that are available!!

All of the staff was very friendly and the counter person was very apologetic about running out of blueberry muffins when I ordered one. Coffee was good as you would expect.They have a small seating area (as you can imagine, a lot of the coffee joints in downtown Chicago are crammed in nooks and cranny's and don't have a lot of space), and a restroom which was easy to access.

I have only been there a couple times (once for dinner, once for lunch on the weekdays) and both times the place wasn't very busy. Granted, it is a HUGE restaurant so they can have quite a few folks inside without it feeling that busy. I am guessing that for game nights and weekends it is a busier.The best place is the bar area and I would recommend having your eats and drinks there unless you have a group. Some of the outlying tables can feel like you are mile from the action. They have TV screen's around but really not that many for a place of this size. Service is satisfactory, but not above and beyond I would say. The food is quite tasty though.Location is on Wabash Avenue and not real hard to find (your on your own for parking if you go that way). A bit of a walk from Metra, but CTA is close. In fact you can watch the CTA trains go by on the L right out of the windows behind the bar.

I was there for the first time this week and must say it was better than the average Twin Peaks. Service was very fast, beer was cold, girls very friendly and easy on the eyes, and ample space inside with tons of TV's. It was a fun vibe, but not too loud. Will stop by again if I am in the area.

Obviously most of their guests have some reason to be in Garner (family, business at some of the substantial manufacturers in town, etc.) as you can find the standard chain-type motels 10 miles west down the highway in Clear Lake next to I-35.The room I was in was very comfortable. Everything worked well, the heater unit under the window was pretty quiet, good free or included internet service, comfortable bed, better than average selection of cable TV channels (no premium movie channels however), and I found the recliner chair in the room very comfortable. The only aspect I didn't really like was that all of the soap and shampoo in the shower and at the sink was provided via those bottles mounted on the wall with the push-dispensers. A nice touch is coffee being available in the lounge/dining area, free cookies in the evening and a hot breakfast in the morning. Usually scrambled eggs, sausage patties, and then either biscuits/gravy or similar, make your own waffles, and fruit, yoghurt, etc in a mini-fridge and your standard juice/coffee. Not bad for a free breakfast at a hotel.There are not a lot of dining options in Garner (a Hardee's, Pizza Ranch, Subway, and a couple local places) and none in walking distance from the hotel so you will need to drive a couple minutes or go to plan B. Plan B is either pizza delivery from Pizza Ranch (info on a card in your room), or an interesting vending option in the hotel for microwaveable meal packs along with the standard candy, chips and soda machines.Overall a very decent place to stay, especially for the price.
Schmerko|FC1F4A876E7B0CBD168CE3AE0A8C58C0|Restaurant|Garner: Pizza Ranch|3| “Small Town Pizza Ranch”|review_458582942|This is a smaller sized Pizza Ranch located on a corner in downtown Garner. During the weekday evening that I dined there you was available parking on the main street in front or on the side street. I can imagine on peak times on weekends you may need to park further away to find an open spot.The interior is a bit dated and not as "ornate" or decorated in Pizza Ranch's normal western theme, however it did feel cozy. As this is a smaller scale Pizza Ranch in a smaller town their buffet is not as extensive as the other Pizza Ranch's I have been too. They pizza selection was pretty decent, however dessert options were limited and not always present. The fried chicken they are famous for was present along with a small selection of sides and salad. Enough to satisfy you but not a wide variety.Food, I thought, was very good; service on my visit was hit or miss. It was hard for me to tell who was a patron and who was working there (no uniforms, name tags, etc.) and I didn't get very many "hi's" or smiles at all (which is rare for a small town in Iowa). No problems with anything, but it didn't seem like there was anyone around if you needed anything and tables only were cleared in big bursts at wide intervals.

The area is not the greatest (a bit industrial) but easy to get on and off the interstate and gas stations nearby. The free breakfast in the morning was better than I expected (for this kind of deal).Yes, the rooms and décor are a little dated and I didn't utilize any of the other hotel functions so I can't comment on that.

They offer a full McDonald's menu and ample parking, through depending on busy the truck stop is you may need to park across from the driveway and dodge the cars coming and going to get inside.They share a bathroom with the truck stop (which is generally clean) but gets pretty good traffic. I've never found the staff overly friendly there and it seems like they are not the fastest when busy. However they are one of the few places to eat between Cedar Rapids and Waterloo on I-380, and it is easy to reach right off of the freeway.On a side note, I find the gas is high priced at the truck stop but if you want something more than McDonalds the convenience store has a variety of food options and Subway is on the other side.

Counter staff was efficient and the food came without much delay. The food was consistent with Hardee's quality. I will say the restaurant was cleaner than most Hardee's I have been to and the dining room had ample (you could say excessive) space.As with all the other Hardee's they go through the standard corporate speech to steer you towards up-sizing your order and while I find the food to be very good (perhaps not the healthiest) I find their pricing to be higher than comparable restaurant chains.

They do not have a large selection on the buffet, but what is on the buffet is very good. Tandori chicken that is roasted but not dried out, warm naan, different vegetable dishes, etc. Service is good and quick and best of all the prices can't be beat ($10 per head for the buffet and soft drinks for only $1).The place itself is right on Harrison (old 61 or the main drag into downtown Davenport) so there is limited parking on the street (you may get lucky and get one of the handful of spots right in front) but they are located right next door to a city run parking garage which is free on the weekends and 2 hours free parking on weekdays.Inside there is an main floor and if they get busy or have bigger parties I believe they open the downstairs or upstairs. It is an older place that could do with updating, but it works.

I think they are on new owners again and the quality and service have gone down. I had to write another review as my earlier review of the place is not, basically, misleading.The night we went the sushi selection was still ok but not as good as before, but you could tell the quality was down. The sushi tasted like it had been out for a while and the fish they used not as good of a quality as before.The Chinese buffet portion has also gone down in quality and is now very hit or miss. Restaurant is not as clean anymore and just not a fun place to go anyway.

I dropped in an a rainy/snowy Monday night and was greeted by a friendly host. They have a few different seating areas (at the bar, floor tables, booths, etc. I was seated in a little alcove with a fireplace in the middle which made it very warm and cozy. The beer selection is pretty good. The food selection is a bit more limited but not bad for a pub and you can find a few classic Irish selections on the menu.Like most Irish pubs in America it is slightly Americanized so you will find a lot of American beers and food on the menu as well. I understand the have live Irish music there from time to time but I didn't get a chance to experience that.Overall a good drinking place located in a area with lot of other entertainment and shops.

Schmerko|FC1F4A876E7B0CBD168CE3AE0A8C58C0|Hotel|Minneapolis: The Hotel Minneapolis, Autograph Collection|5| “Very Friendly Service”|review_456822178|I read some of the previous reviews and did not experience any of the problems they mentioned. The biggest item that stood out for me was the very friendly and good service provided by the staff.Prior to check-in I received a welcoming e-mail from the hotel staff which said to let me know if there was anything they could do so I took them up on the offer to verify my arrival and check-out times would work and that my pick-up truck would fit in their parking garage. I got an immediate response and confirmed everything would work.Upon arrival the front desk clerk didn't find my name right away in the system, but I didn't consider this a big deal as she found the correct reservation only after a couple minutes but to my surprise she granted me access to the concierge lounge as compensation for the delay.The hotel itself is a in a building built in 1908 as a bank, and remodeled by Marriott into a hotel in 2008. The hotel still features/displays some bank vaults on the ground floor. The hotel lobby and ground floor has that grand old look that you would expect from such a building. My room was a bit smaller than perhaps a modern building hotel, but still had plenty of room and was very modern and clean looking. It had a good size closet, good desk/working area, flat-screen TV, in-room coffee maker and a bathroom with a large shower (didn't really love the way the floor was sloped in the shower to drain the water but no big issue). The only street noise I ever heard was if the fire truck was called out but it was a muted sound, otherwise very quiet.I valet parked my truck and knew in advance there would be a $38 charge per night for that. I didn't want to deal with finding an alternative garage and lug my bags back and forth but if you do you can find cheaper parking. The valets where very friendly and efficient.Another benefit of this hotel it that it is connected to the downtown Skywalk system on the second floor. I could walk indoors to my meeting two buildings over and there are plenty of quick eats and convenience stores in the skyway.My work group had happy hour in the ground floor restaurant/bar Max's. This place has the high ceiling, marble and classic style from the old bank days and with good drinks and food and attentive service.Getting to and from the hotel was easier than I thought driving as it is just a few blocks and only a couple turns from the end of the interstate (that dumps you off downtown) and leaving was even easier (granted, I arrived and left between peak traffic periods so plan accordingly).I never experienced any problems with the internet (I just downloaded my e-mails, facebook, etc. and wasn't a heavy internet user). I did see they charge for using the internet, however since I was a Marriott member (not gold status or anything) so the internet was free.Being able to use the concierge lounge provided drinks and light bites in the early evening and basic breakfast (eggs, sausage/bacon, etc) in the am. Food was not plentiful but was good and the attendants were very friendly and helpful.Overall my experience at the hotel was really good and I enjoyed my stay, and never experienced any problems and would stay there again.

The ability to hop on and off at different attractions is a nice feature, but if you do that often it will make a long day (which is fine if you are trying to hit many places). We used it to see what was where and then decide which places we wanted to return to on our own to visit more in-depth. Little kids may get bored after a while and the cars can be a tight fit if crowded. It is not the cheapest either and does come across as a bit touristy. One of those things you do once and call it good.

Osaka Buffet fits the bill. It is even more economical than eating sushi in Asia and the quality and variety is pretty decent as well. They also mark and divide the sushi into cooked and non-cooked section for the newbies.The other bonus is the buffet selection of other food (primarily Chinese food) and a bit of western. My wife said the hibachi grill section was pretty good. Some of their Chinese dishes are better than others.We used to go to the Osaka Buffet in Davenport but after all of their ownership changes in that location (and downward spiral in quality) we now drive across the river to go the original Osaka Buffet and am glad we did.

Now keep in mind we went in September after school started and before the holiday crowds so it was not peak season and was not crowded. I could see that if you went during peak times there could be a lot of lines and waiting.First, if you are even partially into lego's, structures, etc. the lego creations at the park are impressive to see. Even my three year old liked looking at them all.Second, there are a few adult or older kid type of rides to at least satisfy a little bit of the thrill seekers, but this is not the main focus of the park. There are a TON of little kid rides that my daughter absolutely loved and since we were there on a non-peak day she could ride them over and over.Third, they have quite a few inside attractions and buildings were you can go to cool off and relax. We spent some time in one of their lego labs where your kids can run around and play while you have a coffee or soft drink sitting on a nice chair, or dine in the cafe. The aircon was very welcomed.Fourth, Legoland still retains some of the aspects of the old Cypress Gardens including a pretty decent water ski show (lego themed of course), and the beautiful old gardens area. Some of the old planation style buildings are still there as well.Overall we thought Legoland was a great diversion from the crowds in the Orlando resort area, a nice drive down through slightly rural (well at least less suburban Orlando), not quite as pricey, and provides a variety of things to do.

My experience is that some of their dishes are very excellent and some are just average/good. The place is set-up with as a Caribbean beach bar/music type of scene which gives off a fun vibe. The only down side is service can be hit or miss based upon the server you get and how busy the place is.

The other two are Fairfield Inn and Courtyard. The nice aspect of the village is that you can use the pools and restaurants of any of the three hotels and they have some services (an ice cream shop, small cafe, dry cleaner, convenience/trinket store, etc. in a little retail strip on the property. Several restaurants are walking distance from the hotel as well (Golden Corral, Bahama Breeze, BJ's Brewhouse). The best way to describe this hotel is that it is a combination of a business type hotel mixed with family features for tourists going to Disney, Universal, Seaworld, etc. It is not tacky with all the colors and park advertisements that other hotels have, but they are geared to support families going to the parks with shuttle service, large breakfast area, family friendly pools, etc. My best experience was the very helpful front desk staff who went out of their way to help me print park tickets I purchased on-line and made sure we had everything we needed.The hotel is located next to the I-4 freeway and Vineland Road/Avenue which easily gets you to many restaurants and to the various amusement parks, Disney Springs and a premium outlet mall.

It is also easy to go down University Blvd to access ISU's campus or sports facilities, Alumni Center, Stephens Auditorium, etc. The hotel itself can be seen from University Blvd but you need to pull in on the entry-way and drive back to the hotel. Plenty of parking is available. The lobby is very pleasing and attractive. The front desk person (Lark) was extremely friendly and efficient at check-in. The room was very comfortable with plenty of TV channels. Don't expect a great view but the rooms are nice. There is a restaurant on-site with room-service options available as well as ample delivery options from local restaurants. There really isn't anywhere to walk to eat nearby or any restaurants on that side of the highway but it is a short drive down to Duff Avenue (next exit down on HIghway 30) or towards campus or downtown if you so desire.

We went on an early fall weekend and there was a 30 to 60 minute wait on the top to get on the railway. You then had to get off the railway car at the bottom and re-queue for another two plus hours to take the railway back up. The price is not cheap either.I would recommend simply driving to the top and park at the station and then walk around the area. You can go up on the roof of the station and get some very nice views, probably nicer than what you can see from the railcar.

We went on a weekend day and had the opportunity to take their standard or most popular train ride which is a round-trip from the station in Chattanooga. On the weekend they were using a steam locomotive which was nice to experience the sights and sounds of steam. You had an option of riding in an open-air car or air-conditioned (same price, open seating). The trip was roughly 20 to 30 minutes out, and then you had a chance to get off the train and watch them turn the engine on a turn-table and take a brief walking tour of their railroad shops, and then the return back.At the station they have a small museum of local railroad history and a pretty decent collection of old engines and rolling stock in the yard you can walk around and in some cases, walk through the cars.For the price and timing a very nice, economical and easy to access bit of rail history in Chattanooga.

The Twin Peaks in West Des Moines is a great place to go hang-out, enjoy some beer, decent views, and watch sports. They struggle at times to attract a lot of patrons while other times (for example, a big game night) it can be standing room only. The "scenic views" vary from average to good and perhaps not quite as spectacular as their southern siblings (this Iowa location is nearly their most northern location).Their food menu is a bit limited but there are some good options on there. Their hangover burger is as good as any and I especially like their Mom's Pot Roast dish. You will find an decent selection of appetizers, a few burgers and wings, your obligatory fish option, a small sandwich/fish taco selection and that's it. The food is generally good (though I am not a great fan of their fire fries) and better than similar type of places.As you would expect the crowd is primarily male but there are a few women and sometimes families who drop by. If you go to watch the "big game" there you won't be disappointed. On an average day, however, the selection of different sports (and sport talk shows with no volume or subtitles) can leave a bit to be desired.Service is quite good, friendly, and you can be left alone to eat/drink or get chatty based on your preference. Beer is always cold and good with many options.

It is a so-called Lutong Bahay place. We were tired of fastfood in Manila so we tried proper food and I mean proper. Price is just affordable for a place like this. Spacious place though the aroma of an old place was evident but for a change. I also saw pictures of past famous customers enjoying the food like politicians and celebrities. Parking area is spacious too.

It stops right in the middle of every strategic locations in Sentosa. You need to hold your kids though as there are only a few protective track guards. Just make sure your first in line so as to have seats as the seat are a few. The best part is its free if you checked in at Festive Hotel.

I never looked for any place to stay as this is cheaper but worth the money. It is strategically located and far from loud music like in Stations 1 & 2. Place so serene your sleep is uninterrupted and refreshed in the morning. They have a pool too, and conference rooms spacious for our meetings. Wifi is slow though and toilet bowl hard to flush but they have free shuttle transfers to and from the port. It is so near the beach and free breakfast. Resort is so spacious you can walk around the landscape. Try this!

Weekend getaway to the Pacific side of the Philippines. Location is a bit far but fair because you get to drive without traffic and the feel of road adventure. Check-in took so long though and parking area is far and muddy. Breakfast is good but limited tables you get to wait. But the rooms are spacious with balcony and the smell of fresh air from the ocean. Love the pool too..

There's lots more activities for you to do, but heading to the beach was a nice way to end the evening. There are lots of buses and the Sentosa Express to head out here, and it's all free! A man-made beach that doesn't have the best views in the world, but it was still good to get my feet in the sand and just bask in the sunset.

One of the more fun things to do when you're in Sentosa Island. The rush from the luge ride is so fun, and the lift ride going back up is very calming. It's a very nice experience. I enjoyed it a lot and would recommend it to anyone visiting Sentosa. After Univesal Studios Singapore, we headed to Merlion Park and then made our way to the Skyline Luge, before ending the evening in Siloso Beach. Lots to do in Sentosa, and this is one of the better activities!

I'm a fan of theme parks, and although USS is one of the smaller amusement parks I've been to, there's something here for everyone. Lots of great rides and attractions. Food isn't spectacular though, and it's kind of expensive. Best rides are still Transformers and Battlestar Galactica. Waterworld is also a great show to catch! The parade was just good though. It's definitely good for day usage. I would recommend the fast pass if you can afford it, as you will cut down on the longer lines, but if you can wait 30-45 minutes for the bigger rides, it'll be fine. Great stuff!

It's something outside of what you would usually expect in Singapore. Of course, it is a bit of a trek. But still, no admission fee, and it's just a nice stroll in nature.

I liked the cloud forest better, but that's because I like waterfalls more. This place has so many flowers and fauna, and it's a great sight to see. I was lucky enough that there was a Lunar New Year celebration, and there were lots of activities like egg painting and calligraphy, but otherwise, it's a nice stroll on a hot day.

A totally free attraction, you just look up and it's such a sight to behold. To climb up the walkway and walk across the trees, there's an admission fee (which I believe is about 8 SGD), but even if you're just admiring it from the ground, it's amazing! Head there in the late afternoon, and you can catch the light show when the trees illuminate and come to life. It's everyday at 7:45 PM. Good stuff.
MichaelBrianT|E6545D121BA7016899A3953BCAB180F2|Attractions|Singapore: Marina Bay|5| “A great view of Singapore”|review_462628991|You walk around Marina Bay and it's such a great view of Singapore.

The moment you step inside and take in the cool air, you'll feel refreshed and relaxed. Then you look up and you see the 35 meter manmade waterfall. Amazing! Walking all the way up is a great adventure, and there are lots of informative displays and walkways. A bit of caution to those who have a fear of heights, as you do walk across bridges with spectacular views inside the observatory.

It's great public transportation, and it's so easy to navigate. If you're fine with walking for a bit, and learning some of the buses, you will never have to ride a taxi going to anywhere, unless of course it's past 11:30 PM, where the SMRT closes. Still though, the most efficient and convenient mode of transportation in any city I have ever seen!

I had to wait about 15 minutes, so it wasn't too bad of a wait. It was an early afternoon snack. The noodles were very delicious. Maybe a bit of the hype from the michelin star, but it was still really good nonetheless. I recommend you stop by here after your stroll through Chinatown.

I was able to order and pay through their system, which is all done through a touchscreen terminal. Very modern and hassle free. Lots of cuisines for you to try. I tried the Nasi Lemak, and it was really good. I would definitely recommend this place if you're in terminal 2 of Changi Airport and are looking for a place to eat, very similar to the popular hawker stalls and centers.

It's really all that it is, a KFC. But it has several memorabilia items on display. It also has a model of the kitchen, the motel and breakfast dining area that Col. Harland Sanders had on his first restaurant. Worth a stop if you're in the area, if not to take pictures and to say that you ate where the origin of KFC began!

It was a good place to stop by and just bask in nature.

We tried Adarna's Lair and it was a cerebral experience. We didn't exit, so that was a bummer. But I liked the visual artistry inside the room and the music was nice. I just wish the clues were a tiny bit more apparent rather than sort of all over the place. Worth a try!

And they're right. This is a modern take on Japanese cuisine mixed with other cuisines and cultures. They've got a vastly different menu and it's a bold move. The food is good, and served on skillets, which gives it a unique aesthetic. Although I wish the serving of the food could be bigger for the price, it is what it is. Worth a try for any foodie!

When you step in, you'll know it's a hidden gem. They've got such a nice ambiance that is sort of private, cozy and traditional. They've got another branch in a commercial mall, but I like this branch better. The food is really good, and very affordable for Japanese too. You can't go wrong with Nonki.

Imagine a food court, and turn it up a couple of notches. All of the stalls had such a unique but well thought of concept. We ended up eating at Bad Bird and that shawarma place. The food was really good, and I liked the design of the place. Really nice to chill and enjoy an afternoon with good food and friends.

We found this perfect as it was far enough away to feel out of the hustle and bustle but still close enough. We hired a scooter from the Hotel for our stay there and everything on the Island was never more than 45 mins away, normally no more than 20.The resort is stunning, both pools have amazing views and swim up bars. Our room was huge with a private balcony overlooking the ocean and it wasn't the most expensive, there are also rooms with private pools.The food and drinks at all the bars at the resort are great too!The service from all hotel staff is exceptional, everyone is so friendly and polite and nothing is too much to ask. You could not wish for better service.Overall we were delighted with our stay and would recommend Nora Buri to anyone travelling to Koh Samui, we will definitely be back!

The positive part of the meal was the frozen Margherita, that was yum!The staff here are extremely friendly and the service is great, just disappointing that the food was a let down.

The first night we had entrees and mains but the second time we just did tapas, the food is spectacular!Make sure you get the cheese brûlée and chocolate soufflé!The only let down was the slow service and very unattentive staff. If you are happy to wait a while for anything then you must try this place, the food is so good I can overlook the poor service!

It was 990 baht, for adults there was only 3 slides. We went to a waterpark in Singapore that was cheaper and was a thousand times better.The park is good for kids as there are a lot of smaller slides.The 3 big slides are all good fun but not worth the entrance fee. The worst part about the park was how dirty the water was, the wave pool was full of debris and dead bugs, the jacuzzis were so bad we didn't even go in them. There are so many lifeguards doing nothing, no idea why they can't clean the water.If you don't mind paying to much and have kids I would go but other than that I would not recommend this water park.

Everything was pretty much the same as at home, tender ribs and juicy steaks cooked to perfection.The staff were so friendly and the owner goes around and asks everyone how their meals were. He is a lovely guy, we told it was our honeymoon so he raced off and got us a shot each on the house.A great overall experience that all visiting Samui should enjoy!

We sat on the bar as we sipped our cocktail. I like the view of the bartenders buzzing serving guests and making their concoctions. The bar was quite busy, people chatting and having their drinks while munching the free peanuts and throwing the shells on the floor which I mimicked. The cocktail itself was a bit pricey but we just have to do it. One thing on the bucket list ticked.

Some were 5 minute queues and some were more than an hour long.Everything that is sold within the vicinity is quite pricey typical of Universal Studios.They have water fountains in various areas usually near the toilet where you can grab a drink or refill your bottle. Also, there is a hawker area just outside the park which is considerably more affordable with a selection of options for a nice meal.

He said that I have to sit on a different table while they clean up the table that I prefer. After seeing it being wiped clean I asked if I can transfer and he told me that it's only for people who would like to have lunch which wasn't mention earlier. I then said to him that I will have something to eat and he again told me to wait the second time until they prepare the table. He was quite smug and defensive as he was talking to me and it made me feel small.Eventually after waiting for some time two girls just occupied the seat that I wanted without asking the waiting staff. I pointed it out to him and he said that there is nothing he can do about it and he wasn't apologetic about it. I just left.Never again that I will visit Cote Brasserie. It has a lovely setting which tempted me but the service was far from what I expected.

We were appalled by it since they didn't mention it before we sat down for our meal and we were thinking of having dessert.I am never going again, the staff made our group feel unwelcome in the venue.

We mostly had our curtains shut the entire week when we were there. I suggest you book a room on the first floor and above.

Our reservation was made the month before as the waiting list was quite long.We had a three course meal each accompanied by alcohol. The dishes were quite nice but the servings were very small, typical for a restaurant such as this. The waiting staff we're not as friendly nor attentive as the ones we had in Boracay Shangri la. I wasn't very happy about that as I was expecting a similar service. Paying a couple of hundreds of pounds for this kind of service is not worth the money.Despite that, the view was amazing. Even the toilet had a view.

A very busy place but, it is worth it.We asked to be seated on the window side near the entrance. Although there were people coming in and out, the draft wasn't that bad. The staff were very accommodating with your needs and they were very friendly.I ordered a four pound lobster which was heaven, and my partner had very thick steak which he thoroughly enjoyed, we each had our drinks. We had a very lovely time.

They have a large range of food in their menu. But, I honestly can't stray away from their steak and I just love it with bone marrow gravy. It's divine. I can also recommend the grilled bone marrow and triple cooked chips!Do book to avoid disappointment. They can be really busy!

We ordered a platter of grilled seafood which was nice. It had a lot of different bits; fishes, mussels, prawn, octopus and etcetera. The waitress was really nice and friendly.You have to ask them for their dessert. And you get a free shot of Ron Miel :)It's great to have dinner while the sun is setting.

I believe it could feed three or a ravenous two. The staff were nice and attentive. But, may be a bit slow with your requests. The view from the top was quite nice, it was overlooking the old harbour. But be wary, it can be very windy.

The tram stop is only a few minutes away.The hotel is nice and clean. The staff were polite although not all of them can speak English. The rooms were a good size. We were staying in an Elegance Room and you can see the sea and rooftops from the balcony. It was a nice perk having free wifi, continental breakfast, and the minibar wasn't expensive.The negatives are the following:-The bed was made of two single beds joined together and frequently slides away from each other-The walls are a bit thin-It took a while for the bath to be filledFor a BA Holiday (Flights + Hotel), it is a bargain staying here.
Am P|674BE9B05B1AEFA8E4B5F5189EAC2427|Attractions|Istanbul: Cemberlitas Hamami|4| “Scrubbed and washed.”|review_241156395|There is nothing like being scrubbed, washed and a bit of massage.At reception you have to choose what service you want(It is worth getting the traditional scrub), then you will be given a kese and some kind of pass then you will head to the upper floors where you are given a towel and shown to a room where you can change, and for the entire duration of your stay you will have the key to that room(Belongings are safe!). It was a bit embarrassing going down to the bath since you have to pass the reception with a lot of people. The bath was in marble and the interiors were beautiful.They usher you along the way, although I get a little confused as to what they are trying to say.The bath itself was a very pleasing experience, lay down on the heated marble for a couple of minutes, you get scrubbed, massaged and washed. After being pampered you can spend more time in the hamami.This is my first hamam experience and it left me feeling clean, smooth and relaxed. They also have a shop inside and it is worth buying for souvenirs.

Am P|674BE9B05B1AEFA8E4B5F5189EAC2427|Restaurant|London: Bone Daddies Ramen Bar|4| “Ramen and Sake”|review_240910836|A place to visit if you like your ramen. My personal favourite is the 20 hour tonkotsu ramen (Thinking of it makes me crave). It is nice to have with a warm sake and good company.The venue is small and it can get very crowded. If you come little bit early, you can avoid a long queue. Hopefully you won't mind sitting next to strangers.

It was bustling with a mixture of locals and foreigners as customers and it is fairly affordable. The service was fast and there was live music and traditional dance. The atmosphere was quite relaxed and everyone looked chilled. The tea was served by waiters who delivered them with a great sense of balance (How do they keep it in place while pacing as they did?), the hookah came with a sealed mouthpiece and was constantly checked and was refilled with charcoal to keep it going , the rice pudding was served in foil ( -_-)It is near the Bazaar :D

Am P|674BE9B05B1AEFA8E4B5F5189EAC2427|Hotel|Cheltenham: Hotel du Vin Cheltenham|4| “Quite Nice.”|review_161604433|I tagged a long with my partner during one of his trips to Cheltenham. We stayed in Casa Lapostolle. I find it unique having a room name instead of a room number.We were greeted by people in the reception as we entered and whisked to our room. It was rather confusing going to Casa Lapostolle since you have to encounter a maze-like path. The lady at reception helped carried my luggage which was kind of her since that was quite heavy. She also opened the door for us and explained the amenities and told us to just phone reception if we need help.Their breakfast is quite good with fresh orange juice and a selection of ala carte menu and a continental buffet. The hotel itself is located quite near the shopping areas and restaurants which is a plus. Most of the staff were quite nice and entertaining, but, not so with some.

The location of the hotel is near the docks which is to our delight since we will be travelling to Bohol. SM City is just a stone throw away. Our room was big and it looked comfortable and smart. Unfortunately, the walls are not sound proof and you can hear other people from the other rooms (This can be really annoying).I tried their body scrub in their Spa and it was quite nice. I like their spa rooms which are spacious, clean, private and relaxing. It was a little bit irritating when I can hear people gossiping and giggling while I was in my state of relaxation.This is our first time staying in Radisson Blu and we were pleasantly surprised to how much value for money you can get.

As we were about to go to sleep we noticed that the "King" size bed is an adjoined bed made up of two smaller beds which made it quite uncomfortable.We complained about the bed and had to go down the reception. The receptionist took their time going back and forth to us and the management. The receptionist had a lot of excuses why we had that room and so on and so forth. This wasn't what we have expected since it took quite a while. I will be happy if they have quickly sorted out the problem and moved us somewhere with a proper bed. Eventually, they upgraded us to an executive room which was bigger and had a better bathroom, still, it looks a bit dated.The breakfast was really great as there was a lot to choose from. The bread from the bakery was nice and you can get 50% discount after 6pm. The staff were nice, polite and attentive.What me and my partner enjoyed so much was relaxing at the lobby and sipping our cocktails while listening to live music. We also love the fact that the hotel is close to many establishments.

Unfortunately, the kitchen smelled of curry and spices, turning on the exhaust was not enough. We had to tear open a coffee sachet and peel oranges to rid the smell.The breakfast was good, but, when I asked for over easy eggs, it turned out to be too cooked.This is a nice hotel to stay on a budget. SM Megamall is quite near but transportation is somehow difficult when going back to the hotel.

Did not experience this in Shangri-La.Wifi was quite expensive. Php 850 for 24 hours. Most hotels do not even charge for this. The hotel room was expensive enough. The area of the hotel was something I haven't expected as Red Light Districts aren't really my thing. A must to avoid at night. Pimps scout the area for the potential customers during the night.The casino was fun though and hanging by the pool was relaxing. Robinsons is quite near. Not the quality I expected from a 5 star rated hotel.

The speedboat transfer was very convenient and we had a lovely room with the view of the calm clear sea. I love their L'Occitane toiletries.We spent most of our time lazing in their beaches which is superbly tended by their staff. They provided us complimentary water, towels and use of snorkels.We snorkled near the dock and found a variety of marine life and swam with schools of fishes.The staffs were helpful and they even took the trouble to find my lost tab sleeve. If you stay here take advantage of their daily activities ( Sailing Clinic and Kayak Tour definitely a must) and the happy hour at the sea side bar (2 for 1).Boracay will never be the same again if not Shangri-La.

This best describes my experience at the Singapore intercon.The hotel as a whole is nice enough, and honestly the room itself is fine, but I personally am not a fan of looking out into a shopping mall. We stayed in the heritage wing and ultimately had a view of the inside of a kind of mall. I can see how it would be interesting to some... but personally not my thing. I guess I am a traditionalist and still like looking at the blue sky when looking out my window... bears seem to enjoy living in caves... I'll leave the cave living lifestyle to them!

I have yet to see a hotel offering better service then this one. When I travel to Singapore, this is now my "go to" stay hotel! I recommend it to everyone!

Ultimately every hotel which accepts foreigners was fully booked except this one (and even this one only had two rooms left). It was very much no frills... But it was honestly ok. Given the price, you really cannot complain!

Nice and properly managed hotels are a rare commodity in the region. This is the first hotel I can say in the neighborhood which offers international standards. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit!

We ended up eating here 2 of the 3 mornings when we were in Montreal on holidays!

We came for the weekend brunch, and left super full and super satisfied! The breakfast quality is honestly one of the best I have had in years! If you are in downtown Montreal on a weekend, go here for breakfast, you won't regret!

Thankfully we booked with the Intercon Montreal. The location can't be beat! As for the hotel itself, I personally don't have any issues, great 4 to 5 star hotel with great staff. The concierge really know their stuff, don't feel shy to ask! Would definitely stay again!

If convenience is your requirement, then you can't beat this hotel. There are not a wealth of great hotels in causeway bay and I think this should be one of the better options.I personally think this hotel wins hands down due to location! (Lots of great restaurants and cafes about a 5 min walk away at fashion walk).

After a one week stay, my words to my wife when leaving were "I am really not sure how we are going to top this holiday... I honestly cannot imagine a more magnificent place!" I am a very well travelled person and I was blown away by the tremendous beauty. We stayed at a water villa (which was amazing), and I just loved watching the morning sunrises and evening sunsets.... While afternoons were spent snorkeling right off the balcony. I think if just once in your life, everyone should enjoy this experience. Thanks to everyone at the shangri-la for this truly memorable stay!

It started well and I was so excited. My driver was great and the group of people (two other couples) were lovely and fun, but our Guide rushed us through the night as she wanted to finish early! The food is great but we were still hungry and left a lot behind due to the guide wanting to move on. The first music stop was nice but we were not there long as the guide liked the next place (and last stop) which was horrible. It was so crowded in the end we had to stand on the entrance steps until more standing room became available and then it was so loud you could not talk to anyone. I would try it again and hope to get a different guide as it was fun on the vespa and I had a lovely driver.

Staff friendly, very nicely we were upgraded. Great roof top pool and bar, excellent cocktails! Rooms are large and most comfortable bed I have had in four hotels in Vietnam. The only thing is that we were on the 10th floor, with the bar on floor 11. If you don't want to hear the music from the bar till 11:00pm then ask for a room on a lower level!

One of the only operators that limits to 16 per trip so nice ad small without the massive price tag. The early morning start (6:20 pick up) is worth it as we were first to James Bong Island (which gets over 5000/day in visitors) and had no crowds while canoeing Hong Island or walking through the caves. We then found a great island beach to ourselves for a while before a nice lunch overlooking Krabbi. Another deserted island for more water time and we were back into Phuket Marina. There was plenty of food throughout the day and always cold water and soft drinks on hand. Don't take too much on board, all you need is camera, towel and sunscreen. They supply great beach mats and dry bags to keep your things dry. The boat is gorgeous and very well maintained and cleaned. Tip - make sure you wear shoes that you don't mind getting wet as you will be on and off the boat into the water (about calf high in some stops).

After walking around on a hot day and then waiting 10 minutes for a coveted table - it was worth it. Very small but comfortable and cool place with only 9 tables for 2-3. Bun Cha and spring rolls really great, and cheap- 2 x bun cha and spring rolls plus 2 cokes and a iced tea for $13 AUD.

Yes it is a one-sided story but it is still a true story of what happened to the people of Vietnam and I believe you cant come here and appreciate the country without paying respects here. Cheap entry and easy to fill in 2-3 hours. The agent orange display hits home how the impacts are still being felt today, so many children still being born affected. Very emotional, saw many people crying.

So many people. Don't get caught buying anything inside, you can get all the same stuff outside AT for half the price, including tailors, shoes, souvenirs and food. Your better going to the Central Market instead and just wandering around Hoi An in general or getting a bike to ride. If you are going to go, make it early evening with the lanterns it is beautiful. Note that most places close by 9:00 including restaurants and then your left with people trying to get you to go to their bars.

Staff in reception nice, but in restaurant and spa they were not friendly and seemed annoyed that you were speaking to them. Lovely rooms however. Sent out some clothes for laundry, more expensive than Hanoi or HCM and they all came back with our room number written on them in pen on the labels or inside hem!! Will probably look elsewhere next time we are in Hoi An.

We went with a local guide who was great at explaining the history etc which i would recommend. Very accessible with great infrastructure like paths and toilets that does not take away from the beauty. Over a large area so even though lots of tourists still plenty of room.

Be warned that the steps are steep however and be prepared for a lot of them and take water! Also, the vendors below trying to sell marble and jade trinkets, most are not real. If you want the real thing go across the road to the larger shops.

Opens at 10:00. Excellent mix of rides and shows for little ones to the big kids! We waited 60 minutes in line for the raft ride, and some were up to 90 minutes long so keep water with you! Good thing is that most waiting areas are undercover. If you don't mind splitting your group up, opt for the 'single rider' lane, much faster. Transformers ride was excellent!! Good food options and not too expensive as they tend to be in theme parks, happy hour drinks at KTs at 4:00 - Fantastic Mojitos!! Note that many rides do not allow bags/hats/sun glasses and you will need to hire a locker for $4/hour - if your wait time goes over the hour you have to pay again to have it unlocked. Tip - if you want to have the sky gondola ride back to Vivo city at end of day, buy the combined pass with Universal ticket and save $25 per adult.

Rooms are small so not really suited for those who like to hang out in room, but they are very comfortable, clean and modern. Shower is great! Small roof top pool to cool off in. Easy walk to Boat Quay, Clarke Quay, China Town, Lau Pa Sat. Hong Kong street small side street so a bit quieter. Free bottled water and soft drink each day plus use of smart phone - handy to call back home or use to navigate. Would not stay anywhere else.

Very busy so be prepared to wait for your order and book in advance, unlikely you will get in as a walk-in. Good location close to Boat Quay. Food is amazing and freshly prepared - hence the waiting times. Great value compared with Australian prices for sushi. All you can eat! Alcohol expensive. Tip - order a selection of hot and cold at same time as cold will come out faster!

Service excellent, especially Mr Hung and Mr Chien! Good sense of humour. Food amazing. Pear farm interesting, no pressure to buy but beautiful pieces. Only down side was number of tourists at Suprize cave but we were lucky to get there early. No pressure to do any activities, can stay on boat and relax if you choose. Bay spectacular.

The pub is modern clean and well staffed. There is a good selection of drinks and a reasonably sized food menu. The bar and waiting staff were friendly and efficient, they did a good job. The food was hot and tasty and we both enjoyed our choices. The time it took for the food to come out was perfect. The decor was interesting without being overdone and there was plenty of seating even though it was 5pm on a Saturday. Excellent pub and well worth a visit.

It is the must visit pub in the centre of Wellington with a cosy old world charm all of its own. The drinks are well priced with a good selection and the food is superb. There is both inside and outside seating. The building is one of the few old timber buildings lwft along Willis St and has been tastefully restored and that alone makes it worth a visit. When in Wellington I always pop in for a quiet pint and a delicious meal.

Very central hotel in Wellington, easy to find and check in was quick and efficient. Room on the second floor wasn't the largest room I've stayed in but it was big enough. The room was spotlessly clean and tidy. The bed was comfortable and large. The TV worked properly and was a flat screen. Good clean bathroom. The room was quiet especially for a second floor in the middle of a city. The only down side was a lack of hotel parking but this didn't prove to be much of an issue. All round this hotel is excellent for the price paid and I will definitely stay here again.
MattCuthill|1C27F7656012D911F4D350C34D67784B|Hotel|Singapore: Marina Bay Sands|5| “Superb city hotel”|review_462909088|The Marina Bay Sands is the iconic big city hotel. The complex has the hotel, theatres, casino, restaurants, food centre and a three level shopping mall. It is pricey but our room was beautiful and large with a view of the commercial centre second to none. Of course it has the infinity pool, night club, restaurant and viewing deck at the top in a boat shaped building astride the three towers. The pool is cold, and I mean cold even by New Zealand standards and could use some better shade (I got sunburned a bit but it was my fault) but has a fantastic view. The whole complex is a city within a city. The shopping mall is nearly exclusively designer stores not much use for us non billionaires. The only downside is that the hotel is so huge that it takes some time to get anywhere from your room, but this is unavoidable with such an enormous complex. A great place to stay in the city.

The sign said 5 minute queue. We waited in a tiny queue for 90 minutes for a 30 second ride. It was hot, there were no fans going although they were there and there was no air conditioning. Only about 4 people every 10 minutes were allowed on the ride. When I finally got to the top I found out that there was a small number of teens going around and around in the express lane and they were blocking the ride for everyone else. DO NOT VISIT THIS PARK UNLESS YOU BUY AN EXPRESS PASS WHICH MAKES IT VERY POOR VALUE FOR MONEY. Very poorly run park

We visit them regularly and always enjoy the visit. They can get crowded over the summer holiday period so the best time to visit is opening time, dinner time and evening. The cafe does an excellent eggs benedict until 11am. The spa is excellent but both the pools and spa are somewhat pricey so go online and look for specials. The pools have a cold water swimming pool, hydroslides and lazy river for the young uns so it is a great family destination.

So much fun, I signed up for season pass :).. Here are my tips on how to enjoy the park:- buying an unlimited express pass is totally worth it! No need to q and u can sit as many times u want on a ride.- Bring your own poncho/raincoat for the Jurassic park water rides, buying one inside USS cost $4 each- Be sure to plan to watch the shows, such as water world and Sesame Street, timings are printed on the brochure- Food is average and quite expensive, u could go to the Malaysia food street located beside USS entry for lunch/dinner instead- Bring a water bottle, there are water coolers scattered all over the park, 1 bottle of water cost like $4-5, do keep hydrated cuz it's super hot and humid in tropical Singapore- Beware of crowds of tourist from China trying to cut the queues and pushing their way to the front. :(

It's a very nice, spacious indoor aquarium and the air conditioning is good, so it's an escape from the heat too. This is one attraction in Sentosa that gives a wow factor, well maintained and lots to see, even as an adult. Well, snacks and drinks inside are kinda pricey, then again, it's kinda expected right? So I'd bring my own water and get snacks from the 7-11 instead.

That seems like their target audience since it's located near a casino. But other than that, nothing u wouldn't find at Orchard road. Restaurants and cafes here can be crowded during lunch, so do eat early.
Pink P|7B580C37922B314610EE5EA62ECBD2AF|Attractions|Singapore: Chinatown Heritage Centre|5| “Nice, well maintained museum in Chinatown”|review_460077214|This museum is converted from a shophouse, it's not as spacious as other museums in Singapore it's definitely well designed and thought through. A nice trip back in time and everything looked so life like. It was located just a few steps away from the Chinatown mrt station so getting there was easy.

This mall is spacious and very large, so take your time here, away from Bangkok's heat.
Pink P|7B580C37922B314610EE5EA62ECBD2AF|Attractions|Singapore: Orchard Road|5| “Best shopping belt in Singapore ”|review_416691180|A place for endless shopping, eating and all services can be found here. It's so convenient to access by MRT. Malls range from Super high end, designer brands to affordable street/casual wear. There are many hotels situated here too, so it good for tourist.

Lots of shopping for girls mostly (maybe 10% guys), so, like the title says, ladies, u need a man to carry all your heavy shopping :D There is a good mix of casual streetwear to slightly dressier clothes, prices are good for Singapore standards. Most shops don't allow trying clothes on tho. U will see a lot of students and girls in their 20s here. Store holders are mostly friendly and u can bargain, but only a bit.

There is a bigger discount when purchases are made in bulk, so it's a good idea to shop with friends. I've visited both the morning and night markets at the same area, and there are more stalls open at night.

I would probably rate this place as a "Must Go" 10 years ago when there weren't as many shopping Malls as there are now. E.g. Platinum Mall, Union Mall etc..Overall Chatuchak Market is an open air market where everything imaginable is sold here. Pet stuff, clothes, bags, snacks, vintage items, furniture etc... The location is easy to reach by BTS. But only very few shops are air conditioned and it's honestly very hot and humid shopping here. Make sure u keep yourself hydrated and keep loose change in your wallet for toilet trips, it cost 3 THB to enter the toilet.
Pink P|7B580C37922B314610EE5EA62ECBD2AF|Attractions|Bangkok: Union Mall|3| “Nice, but not fantastic ”|review_416684946|This is something like a mini Platinum Mall, much lesser shops but with larger walk ways. To be honest, I was quite disappointed. Things here can be found at Platinum Mall for the same prices. Didn't see many bargain buys here tho. U can try the 12 Baht boat noodles on 4th or 5th floor when u are here. Only spent like 2 hours here, including lunch and headed back to Platinum for more shopping. A plus point is that Union Mall is easily accessed by BTS and its near to Chatuchak market.

U can get groceries, beauty, household items and snacks here, but I don't see the big hype about this place. Lots of tourist buy snacks in bulk, such as pocky, seaweed and instant noodles. It can be pretty crowded in evenings and weekends with everyone pushing their trolleys and carrying baskets.

Though it's not the cheapest place to shop, there are so many options and people are friendly. There is a foodcourt on the top floor that serves really yummy foods and fantastic mango sticky rice.

The Shibuya 19 mall is certainly not what the name suggest, yes it sells clothes and fashion items, but shops are rather few and sparse. That being said, clothes and bags that I managed to find here is of similar quality to Platinum mall but cheaper. A tee shirt at Platinum mall costing THB 300 will probably be only THB 200 here.

Most of the staff have a scowl on their face and not happy to answer any queries. The staff at the carts & the ones attending the rides are just there physically and have this uninterested blank look so please don't ask them anything as they answer you in a patronising manner. Management has done a poor job in training and uplifting the morale of the staff. However thumbs up to Mel's café staff , they are the best, so cheerful !

Although the room is very basic (no fridge, coffee/tea facilities and bottled water for drinking) but the rooms are clean with comfortable bed. Real value for money. My reservation included towels & toiletries. Everyday you leave the used towels outside your room and you collect the fresh towels & toiletries from the reception. There is also washing machine, dryer, ironing board, microwave and hot/cold water dispenser next to the lobby. Check in is at 2pm and if you want your room earlier than you pay a surcharge. The staff are friendly and helpful and you can purchase your Myki pass from reception. Hotel location is very near to CBD and Lygon.

After a day out walking in Busan it is nice to soak your tired legs in the jacuzzi and the bathroom even comes with a sauna. The bathrooms are equipped with generous supply of toiletries (big bottles and not the tiny ones normally provided in other hotels). The owner, Mr Son, speaks good English (thank God) and very friendly and helpful in giving directions. This guy should be given a Tourism Award for promoting Busan with enthusiasm. Will defintely stay in this hotel again!

After browsing menus as we walked past, finally decided on Neptunes. Staff are very attentive, and actually know their menu well. Drinks take a little while to come out and the beer could have been colder but that's the only issue we had. We had the soft shell crab and caramelised scallops for entrée, both were yummy. For mains hubby had the bugs and I had grilled barramundi with half a bug. The bugs are HUGE. They were cooked really well and had a lot of flavour. Seafood treated with respect. We loved this place and will definitely be back, and recommend to friends :)

Not the best customer service. every other time we've been in they have been good, but this time not so much.

The heater wasn't working so that was replaced while went out. Its in such a good position, close to everything and only a couple mins walk from the town centre. although no dining options, we didn't find it a drama. The bus for Coronet Peak also stops out the front as well so no need to lug all your ski stuff into town :)Will definitely stay again!

It was so easy to organise our one day intro dive from Australia with Lexy, who is really easy to communicate with. The day itself was so much fun! We were explained safety and dangers, a basic rundown of diving itself, what creatures we were expected to see, shown the equipment and how to use it and tried everything on before we went into the water. Once in the water, our instructor, Neil, was really good, going through skills with us, making sure we were comfortable and everyhting was working OK. He took so many brilliant photos of us and the creatures we saw! The best thing about Bubba, is that the day wasn't just about diving. It was about making us feel safe, and also made sure we had a whole heap of fun! They even provided a blow up slide, a paddle board and a couple of canoes to use throughout the day. Lunch and breakfast and afternoon tea was awesome also! Definitely the best experience of my trip and I will definitely be coming back to Bubba!!Thank you Neil and Lexy, and the whole crew of Bubba and Latitude for our wonderful day :)

The cages were crowded and dirty, the ostriches feathers were falling off, all the animals were malnourished and skinny, and the shows were just sad. The elephants seemed stressed and bored. The poor orangutan that is trained for photos was absolutely beautiful; I wanted to take him home he looked so sad! Overall I would have preferred to pay 2000 baht for a clean zoo with well cared for animals rather than 500 baht for what I experienced. I really wish I had of read the reviews before visiting this zoo, I wouldn't have gone if I had.

Hot, thirsty and craving a Singha, we pulled in to the After Beach Bar. Straight away we were whisked to a little table on the balcony by the manager (who was really funny!) and had Singha's in our hands within 30 seconds. We had had a big breakfast but were talked into having "my famous shrimp cakes" by Mr Manager, and oh my, they were delicious!! Perfect little adventure and will definitely go back!

We did the full lot and had lunch at the end. Everything was really good, safety is first priority, lockers for your valuables, the staff and guides are really professional, but also really make sure everyone is laughing, keeping up and having a great time. The 400m zipline is wicked, and there is a great photo opportunity when doing it. You can bring your camera, but I recommend having a strap and tying it to your harness. Wear enclosed shoes!! We did, but some of the other people didn't, and they struggled a little. The lunch was amazing! We really enjoyed the different curries, and the cool towels they bring around. The whole day was a really fun adventure and definitely worth every penny! :)

The elephants seem well cared for, the property is large and is also a rubber farm. Our elephant was amazing! She had a mind of her own, and kept stopping to poke around and different things, and the rider was really patient with her, let her do what she wanted, just kept her on track if she decided to wander. He let me ride behind her ears too (really strange experience!) while he got about 100 photos of us! The scenery was beautiful, amazing views of surrounding beaches and ocean, plenty of photo opportunities too. At the and of the ride, we were able to help hose our elephant down to cool her off and feed her bananas, they only ask for a donation :) overall wonderful experience and would definitely recommend Kok Chang!

We had the most wonderful experience! Being our first time in Phuket, we were not sure of the area or where to go or what to do, but the hotel staff made us feel very welcome and were very helpful from the moment we entered the lush resort. The welcome drink was delicious and we were not disappointed in our room. The staff orientated us to the room, the services and the area which was very helpful. I loved the free wifi, and the free dvd player in the room (no other hotel we stayed at had the DVD player). The breakfast was delicious! It had such a wide range. The pool bar with the happy hour from 4-6pm cocktails were great, just what we needed after a big day exploring the area. I loved the gardens, the fact that the road noises just disappear when you enter the resort complex, the beautiful authentic Thai theme, and the fact that every single one of the staff go out of their way to say hello. The mosquitoes weren't a problem during our stay, the staff come around and set up your room for bedtime, including spraying for mozzies and setting up your net over your bed, as well as citronella flames throughout the resort. The resort is located about a 10-15 minute walk to Kata beach, but has a free shuttle service every hour until 1800, and taxi services are a bit more pricey in this area we found, so we rented a motorbike from Kate Kwan tours across the road, and they were also brilliant. We lost our bike key and had to pay 400THB to replace it (which we were quite happy to do), they loaned us another bike, but when we returned at the end of the day, the hotel staff had found the key and gave it back to the tour office, who gave us our money back! Needless to say we continued to go there for everything! The laundry lady in the tailor shop next door to Kate Kwan tours is also really nice, really funny, and does a cheap laundry wash! Overall this resort was the best resort we stayed at on our trip to Thailand, and we regretted having booked another resort for the other half of our stay. Thankyou so much Sawasdee Village for making us feel at home. You definitely deserve your trip advisor award! We will definitely be back next year!!Brooke and Brett :)

We ate from both the lunch menu and the breakfast fare, and I have to say the food quality was excellent. Friendly service, with interesting local food to buy as groceries if you need. Great concept.

Celarly a favourite of the local stock brokers and other financiers, it had a great range, well made coffee and a range of delicious breakfast staples. Reasonably priced, it has deserved its crowds of customers.
Simon M|9AA5FB65578C5C5CD2A3E42C1A77F54C|Hotel|Brisbane: Mantra Terrace Hotel|5| “Great hotel at any price”|review_494407992|In Brisbane for a last minute work trip - I just needed a bed. I found the Mantra Terrace extremely clean, comfortable, well located, and the service was really friendly. A great find after many years of finding Brisbane hotels to be overpriced and poor value. I would recommend it any time - be ready for the small room, but hey - you are only sleeping there right?

The air was fresh, the ferries and rowers were out on the river, and bike riders out getting in their pre-coffee cadence up. Well and truly recovered from the floods.

The Burrito Bar was calling, with good recommendations on TA. The food was excellent - served fresh, full of good healthy produce, and best of all the margarita was delicious. Friendly service, so I could enjoy the warm night outdoors.

They are spot on with their estimates for phone orders. Try the scallops - they are amazing.

The service was a bit off, so I will give them another chance in the future to test. Good bar choices, and the specials seemed to be good value.

The views were spectacular, and the ritzy golf course below looks amazing. The lighthouse is made of enormous stone blocks, and is going to last forever, despite the incredible winds that are a regular feature of the locale. At least go there to breathe in the freshest air in the world - it is invigorating.

Simon M|9AA5FB65578C5C5CD2A3E42C1A77F54C|Restaurant|Currie: King Island Bakery|3| “Good bakery in Currie”|review_469500012|We stopped for a late lunch, and given it was a public holiday, not a lot was left. The seafood pie was ok, but not as good as others - and certainly not up to the standard of the scallop pies I have enjoyed in Tassie. The coffee was a 6/10.

Good value, fresh, good Kopi and Tea, and the breakfast combo is filling with toast, poached or boiled eggs and a cup of tea for under $8.

The slides are varied, the water is warm, and gliding around the park on a tube is a most relaxing way to pass time. Do the snorkelling, and the magnetic water-slide ride - accelerating on a water-slide for the first time is an exhilarating experience!

Aquarium|5| “Amazing aquarium”|review_462114616|I have been to quite a few aquariums around the world, and this is by far my favourite. Normally an hour or 2, and that is enough. Seriously, I could go back tomorrow, there is that much to see, and the displays are that interesting. REALLY recommend this, even for the sceptics.

Unfortunately, the burgers - 4 different ones out of 6 meals (ribs and salad for the other 2) were uniformly horrible. For the price, they should be outstanding. Service was good, and given all of the burgers were bad, we were not interested in replacements.... Ribs and the salad were very good.

On the oth r hand the Botanic gardens were so underrated they are worth the visit alone.

Obviously aimed at a different traveller, you will be offered suits, tuk tuk rides, and all manner of other less savoury things every few metres. If you are up for that good luck, but for this traveller Patong is a definite NO

The ladies were all very pleasant and calm, and the environment was extremely clean and we all felt safe. The hot stone massage was a hit as was the usual back and neck massage. We all finished with foot massages, with 2 of our 4 going to sleep! About the only thing worth going to Patong for!!!!

The food is pretty good - but quite expensive compared to other similar restaurants, and the service is slow. Inside the restaurant is really loud, and outside tables are subject to duelling musical tastes from the neighbouring restaurants! Overall, it is average, and could do better on service, value and quality.

The pre-dinner drinks and hors d'oeuvre were simple but delicious, and wonderfully tasty. The service was attentive without being over the top - it was simply great to experience.Dinner was served smoothly and promptly for the approximately 100 attendees , and the food was sensational. Lamb served as it should be, and quail just beautifully cooked - as good as anything anywhere. The vegetarian choice was enjoyed by those that selected that option.I would highly recommend taking any foodie here, and being confident that they will leave impressed, satiated and planning their next visit!

However, once we made it to the new extension to the hotel, we found rooms that would be found in any decent 4 star city hotel - everything was laid out thoughtfully, it had a most comfortable bed, good desk, amazing shower and bathroom, and all electricals working, in the right place for charging computers, iPads and phones - it was all very clever.

We were so delighted we tried this group - the elephants were so happy they purred!The trek was a marvel - we were with 2 older females elephants, who took us on an adventure, through the jungle, walking in a running river for almost 500 metres, past palm oil plantations, native jungle and local people going about their daily chores. The animals were so calm and the handlers were exceedingly gentle with their charges. We have some amazing photos, and after returning over an hour later, we fed the elephants a few baskets of bananas each, but as we found later, that was only a tiny part of the 300kg they eat each day. We were shown all over the camp, where the handlers live, the washing area, where the elephants are bathed and scrubbed at least twice a day, and the massive piles of greenery the elephants munch away on.There were a couple of young elephants in the camp, who were clearly happy with humans, as they walked freely around. In all, a most wonderful experience, and given the lack of opportunities for these magnificent animals that have been rescued from logging camps, there is little else for them to do, and the humane treatment shown in Huay Tho gave me encouragement that there is a way for them to enjoy their lives, as they clearly were incapable of going back into the wild.

We had the hotel arrange an excursion which was fantastic, and we also did several of the in-house activities both paid and unpaid - the Bat cave hike, although relatively challenging for the older members of our party, led us to incredible views, and the in-house Thai cooking lessons were incredible. The pool is spectacular, as is the wildlife - particular the local monkeys, providing hours of entertainment for young and old, while the Grotto provides an amazing natural location for meals. Finally - the views are just breathtaking. All day, every day, sun, win, shine or night, there are just the most amazing sights. One of those places that just should be visited at least once in a lifetime.

The decor belies the quality of the food, and the service and advice from the owner excellent. We ate wonderfully well, with subtle spicing and flavours not usual in Melbourne's surprisingly noncompetitive Indian food scene and left the Darjeeling warm and well fed.

The service is top notch and the facilities make it perfect location for any of a family GC holiday, romantic getaway, mates golf weekend or visiting to see the footy at Metricon which is only the other side of the golf course away. My only criticism would be that the carpets and soft furnishing is due for a refresh, and based on my experience of other RACV owned resorts, they will do that properly as well in the not too distant future.

Airplanes, tops of viewing towers etc. Videre has made me believe differently. Wonderful and well made food, with good and interesting combinations make for an extremely positive outcome. The service is excellent, unobtrusive but always available and the prices are good for 5 star. Worthy of trying.

Shuttle also available to bring you there from the hotel if needed.- staff - berjaya langkawi staff are one of the best. Professional, friendly, and top notch service. We've never had any negative experience with the staff.- beautiful rooms - can only attest to a family chalet which we have rented. 2 adjoining chalets in the forest. Rooms are clean, sheets neatly tucked and pressed - toiletries provided, and towels are available. Rooms are huge with balconies and excellent ambiance.- food - free breakfast buffet and a complementary dinner was provided with our reservation. The panthai restaurant is by far the best (reservation needed though). Breakfast buffet pretty good choices.- beach and pool amenities - beach is serene, peaceful not much of people going about so total relaxation is possible.The negatives:- gets really quiet- take note to the party people- stay at a different hotel at pentai cenang if you're imagining party at the beach. Berjaya is for serene and peaceful relaxation. You won't find beach parties here.- as pointed out bars closes at 8, pool bar closes at 7- so for the happy alcohol drinkers- drink early or drive to pentai Cenang or stay at pentai cenang hotels- shuttle rides- you'll be required to take shuttle from your chalet to any part of the resort, don't get me wrong though, it's fun, and it makes Berjaya resort "the" berjaya resort, but sometimes the smell of diesel fumes is just way too much Berjaya could definitely improve on a more cleaner mode of transport. And yes, small roads plus shuttles going both ways, means not for the faint-hearted. In summary Berjaya is uniquely Berjaya. It has it's own character. Some review says the resort is antiquated, but i'd say it brings charm and character. Berjaya is an acquired taste i would say. We needed to book another hotel in Pentai cenang for the beach party, but went back to Berjaya the next day. Not for the adventurous and party animal at heart. But definitely if there is a need for space or taste a little refinement this place is for you. Groupies and party people - not unless you rent a car and decide to have a designated driver then forget travelling to Berjaya and partying in penatai Cenang area. Though near theres a patch of zigzag road that needs some driving skills. If you're deciding to rent a car and drive yourselves and party at cenang while staying in berjaya, i would strongly suggest insurance insurance insurance.For the honeymooners, the couples, the secret lovers, and the complicated relationships, Berjaya Resort Langkawi would be a great hideaway. Get lost in each others embrace, just be with the person you care and love with no disturbance this would be the perfect hideaway.

Though they have other menus to offer, the mexican food is just great.Staff-this inn by far has the best staff in town. Professional, friendly, and there's a sense of comfort and security with this team. They never fail to make sure all your reasonable requests are taken cared off. You always get that smile and a feeling of familiarity every time you go pass by the front desk. Getting bored, go up to the restaurant and strike up a conversation with the restaurant staff.Note:parking is difficult though for this inn, though the last time i stayed there, they were constructing more parking spaces for guests. Call in advance for reservation since they have a lot and by a lot i mean a lot of regular guests (just like me) staying. So always check for availability.Overall, every time i go to cebu for a visit, there's just no other hotel for me. Its always this pension house. Downside: limited parking and at times non existent at all..constructions for a parking space is on the way though.

Local artists showcase talents, produce and the best of all the food stalls. Starting at 5pm untill 10pm. Food stalls line up for a gastronomical escapade within the market. A taste of the diversity of culture in Melbourne though food.Be warned though. You'll have to line up, and some stalls have long lines, so going there to taste the experience on an empty stomach is not advisable. Another thing is parking. Be patient-the ultimate rule. Parking is as hard as finding needle on a haystack. There's limited parking slots on the premises itself, so bring some luck.All in all the waiting to park and the lining-up to pay is surely rewarded with some good food.I suggest having some paella, and some roast pork.

Then try headin down the melbourne sea life aquarium. Dont expect something like swim with the sharks and stuff. Its not as impressive but still amazing and some underwater walkway. If you scuba dived before or have been to larger aquariums the by all means skip this and just explore somthing else. But if you have children, or friends visiting from overseas and they lack time to go outside cbd the they will enjoy this. Especially the children. For the impatient hard to please adults, i tell you. Theres not much to see in here so my advise would be go somewhere else if your the complainin hard to please kind. For the young lovers, well this would be a nice stroll instead of the usual park, if they still do the stroll nowadays but yeah something different just be mindful that there are lots of children around so i steongly auggest to skip the making out in the dark corners. All in all this place is an acquired taste. Its not too big to make you drop your jaws but its not that small to frown about. Id give it 3 stars out of 5 for the fun factor. I did like it but would not say enjoyed it.

Bruce B|92184D383FBD92E2A545F72234354C63|Attractions|Victoria: Great Ocean Road|5| “Long Drive”|review_207282860|Thinking of exploring Victoria, and you have time on our side? This fantastic stretch of road brings you to the most spectacular view of the ocean and awesome rock formations. It's one I would suggest to friends, and family alike.The Great Ocean Road is a trip that needs a planing. I would not personally suggest to make this an unplanned out of the blue. We planned this trip for a couple of days, for the mere reasons that there are 2 popular ways of exploring this seaside escape. If the main purpose of the trip is just a short "see the 12 Apostles" (which I am making a different review) then you can take the short distance road Princes highway via Geelong and reach the 12 Apostle look out in 2-3 hours, depending on road works and go back via the same route.Technically, the Great Ocean Road is for the people who needs relaxation. We took the long drive via Torquay, Lorne, heading to Apollo Bay. We did a 3 day trip, so technically, nobody was in a hurry. This is the kind of trip where you just sit back, relax, enjoy the sun, the view, the sea, sand, and the food, and people along the way. This route is a 4-5 hour drive taking into consideration the constant stopping and photo taking and lookouts and beaches. I suggest making sure your not in a hurry. Say just stop by a beautiful beach sit, relax, let the sea breeze take all the stress away.The drive was set until Port Cambell, that's around 15-20 min away from the 12 Apostles Visitor centre, that is to make sure that we sulk in all the views and the beach and the sand. Found a decent place to stay, and stayed there for 2 days. Just being lazy, watching the sea, walk in the sand.On the way to Port Cambell there are a lot of views and lookouts to pass by, just make a short stop for photos and quick break for food and short rest. Passed by the 12 Apostle and went back to see the great 12 rocks, 7 actually, the next day.I would say, for people who wants to do a lot and needs more action, this trip is not for you, or might be well, just for a day. This is for the travellers who would want to unwind, let their hair down, and just be lazy amongst the sand, the waves, and the scenery. Feel the sand on their foot and see and explore around local food and dining and people and views and lookouts. Beware to the impatient ones. All you'll see are cliffs, sea, sand and more sea and sand and sun along the entire highway, so don't be a spoiler, NO ARE WE THERE YET ALLOWED on this trip, or else, you would not be able to see the beauty of it...it'll just be just another coastal highway.
Bruce B|92184D383FBD92E2A545F72234354C63|Attractions|Summerlands: Phillip Island Nature Parks - Penguin Parade|4| “Road Trips and Penguins”|review_180747586|Planning for a road trip from Melbourne? The Phillip Island is just a couple of hours drive away from Melbourne CBD. Pack some good music and food while travelling though, the journey is not as scenic as expected, and can sometimes get a little boring. Once there though, it's a little different. Shops for the "shopaholics" with great prices, nature for the nature trippers, and if you have friends who tagged along for the sake of tagging along, then surely they will not fret. The bay side view is amazing. (see photos attached)For the animal lovers, you can feed the Kangaroos, and see lots of live birds and local animals in a natural (sort of) habitat. Good to note: just make sure the weather's good though, sunny and at least not raining or hasn't rained the night before or that good old pair of shoes will be needing some washing after.The highlight of our trip was the Penguin parade. To be totally honest, I was caught off guard by the mere size of the Penguins. IF your expecting "happy feet" penguins, then prepare to be disappointed. These little fellas are small, but none the less, cute and still Penguins. I also advise to check local time of the parade cause you might be stuck there for an hour or so waiting for the parade time. Normally, the spectacle start at around 5 or 6.Weather. The best advise I can give though is to see the parade during summer, or late Spring. If planning to see the parade at winter time, I strongly suggest to bring extra jackets and warm clothing, or be prepared to shell out extra 20 AUD for fleece blankets available at the shops.Overall, I would recommend this to family with children who surely would enjoy the animals. First time tourist who would enjoy the scenic view and the entire experience of something new. If nature trip, and animals is not to your liking, pack a couple of funny friends.

Bruce B|92184D383FBD92E2A545F72234354C63|Hotel|Dumaguete City: Coco Grande Hotel Dumaguete|4| “A cozy hotel just about right.”|review_162680341|Location: the hotel's location is situated just right at the heart of Dumaguete city. One would only need a pair of slippers and some sun block. Its just 10-15 minutes walk away from Silliman University and only 15-20 minutes away from the shopping malls through pedicabs ( motorized tricycle) as they are popularly known in the local dialect. The only down side is traffic. Due to its proximity to one of the biggest universities in the Visayas Island, traffic can be worst during class days, at 7 am, 12pm and 5pm. It is a 20 min ride from the city night life, clubs and various bars.ServiceHotel services are basic...no pools gardens and lush landscaping. It is a stop and go hotel suited more for business trips than a leisurely vacation. Good to nite though, the hotel can arrange a trip to Siquihor island through its sister hotel and resort Coco grove.StaffHotel staff are friendlier compared to other hotels...based on experience, they are professional and courteus.Rooms and ambianceFor travellers with a taste for more edgier and more modern decour this hotel is not for you. The hotel has a more antiquated feel to it. A classy refined taste of art paintings, antique decours and dim lighting...adding to a hint of subtlety to a classic well orchestrated ambiance.The rooms are huge, huge beds, spacious comfort rooms and closet. Space is not an issue especially with the family and suite rooms.All in all it is a good find. But be warned thia hotel is an acquired taste...there are travellers who would not enjoy the classic aura it exudes, some look for that exact experience.

Its a small strip facing the ocean boasting restaurants and a few other commercial cafe's and bars. 10-20 minutes ride away from the Dumaguete City Lee Plaza and Robinson's place. Walking distance from the fast ferry terminal, 15-20 minutes motorcab (PEDICABS as localy known, or tricycle), from the bus terminal, and a 20-30 minute motorcab ride from the Sibulan Airport (ground transportation to/from airport can be arranged with the hotel, and will take around 15-20 minutes).Accomodation:Rooms are clean, well maintained, fresh and homey. I personally suggest if travelling with extra budget to go for the Suite Room located at the upper most floor. With a hefty price of 4500PHP/night (may change without notice) the best part is the view, the bed and of course my personal favorite the en-suite sauna which is available for you 24/7. Other accommodations are also good.Staff: Staff are professional and friendly. Food: Cafe Filomena is available at the ground floor right near the entrance. Food is good, with a variety of menu to choose from. I suggest not expecting too much international cuisine from the cafe, but then again, the food is quite good. Pros:Service, Clean Rooms, Large Room (for suite), homey, available access and public transport (pedicabs/tricycle), food. NO SMOKING Policy (for non-smokers)Cons:People who doesn't like stairs and elevators, noisy sometimes (due to social functions they normally hold) NO SMOKING Policy (For smokers/ Smoking area provided outside the hotel entrance)

Normally, Bohol is famous for it's beach front properties, but if you want to have a different perspective, then I would highly recommend Bohol Plaza. It's around a 15 minutes drive from the Bohol Fast Ferry Terminal and is situated on a hillside. The best thing about bohol plaza is the view. The stunning sunrise view you get is something quite fascinating. To top that up, the 180 degree birds eye view of the islands of Bohol is just amazing. (see photos attached). However, if your travelling senior and would not enjoy stairs and elevators, then this place is not for you. The structure in itself is quite good, with good food, and excellent customer service.

The hotel staff including the guards are really friendly. Coming from a long travel, the hospitality of the staff is a great warmer. They are very approachable, professional and good to note, for a small hotel, they are adequately staffed. Comparable to large 5 star hotel the only difference is the personalized service, not the automated smiles of those large hotel staff.The rooms. The room i got was a single room. Though single, the room was spacious, clean and it smelled nice. The comfort room was also very clean, with good towels, toiletries and surprisingly hot water. Though you have to let the water run for a couple of minutes to have the hot water running, bur nevertheless it is something i never expected for such a price. They gave me a riverside view which was great. I had a picturesque view of the river and the bridge.The location. Its a 15 minute ride to sm city.Smallville is also near. The ferry terminals are 15 minutes away by taxi...so location was great.Services. The inn does not have an inhouse restaurant, but there are available food choices on the same building. Mang inasal is just right on the entrance, as well as a korean restaurant.Good to note is a small cafe at the hotel entrance, that provides basic breakfast and caffeine needs for a very affordable price.All in all, the experience with this inn was great...highly recommended...

Don't believe this hotel has enough staff to keep up with the foot traffic. The pool is amazing but was jammed packed at most times making it unenjoyable but views are beyond this world. If you don't mind crowds do it, if not then pay a little less at another 5star hotel down the road :)

We all ate so much, I could hardly walk after. It was amazing. 6 of us ate and we paid just under 70 Canadian for all of us, shakes included. Best food I had in Coron. Restaurant was clean, quiet and staff was friendly. I wish we would had ate there every night.

Staff was friendly and accommodating, a chorus of greetings every morning. The staff set up our island hopping, massages and transportation. The location of the resort is very central and safe, close to really good restaurants and the water. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The pool is clean and a good size. I was so sad to leave and I will be coming back for sure!

The park has everything between calm and thrilling rides. Some of the rides could have been longer but I say that about every theme park! It's worth getting the express tickets to skip some lines, especially when it's busy. I probably won't go again but it was fun for the time I was there.

Soo much to see, explore and learn! All kinds of sea creatures and information about them. Although when i was there it was very busy and full of people, I was still able to see everything and get a good long look. The set up helps move things along and has large areas to accommodate a big crowd. Definitely worth a visit.

Staff was very friendly and helpful and as well the food was quite good. I'd recommend!

This year was our 3rd stay and we are positive there will be more to come in this hotel. We drive 16 hours so it is always nice to arrive to a welcoming staff and a clean room. The breakfast is very good, a nice pool and fitness room, as well as free wifi (which we all love) The rooms are comfortable and updated. I have high standards for clean and this hotel is CLEAN. Which I appreciate very much! I would recommend this hotel to anyone! What a wonderful stay!

My friends, family and I arrived at 10pm after 11 hours of travelling in hopes to crawl into clean beds and sleep. Unfortunately that did not happen. First thing I found within 5 minutes of being in the room was what appeared to be a blood stain on the bedding. After this another friend on the trip pulled back the sheets on her bed and found popcorn in-between the bed sheets. ( we had not eaten popcorn ) we found long black hairs in the bedding ( none of us have black hair ) as well as Cheerios on the floor ( which as well we had not eaten ) along with all of that our door was filthy. After a long discussion with the front desk we were upgraded and they honoured our prices but regardless I feel this doesn't undo the lack of cleanliness that was made apparent to us. If you decide to be bold and book a room with this Sandman please be sure you are in their updated newer suites. Not the older building. As well be sure to check your sheets, they forgot to mention the complimentary snacks within.

There are a lot of souvenir shops and stalls, but it has not lost its culture completely. There is some great architecture and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and the Sri Mariamman Temple are worth a visit.

My friend's sling turned up without any fruit dressing, no apology! Staff were indifferent and from the facial expressions and general demeanour would happily be anywhere else! Shame as Raffles is a beautiful hotel steeped in history and for a lot of tourists this will be their opinion of it.

My husband had previously stayed and wanted to return, I was worried that after hearing of this beautiful hotel up in the hills, that it would not live up to expectations, but it absolutely surpassed them. Peter and his staff were very polite and helpful. They arranged a car to pick us up from the airport we arrived late at the hotel so they took us straight to our room, which they had kindly upgraded for us due to part of our party not being able to make the trip. The room was fantastic with an infinity pool over look the forest valley. The room had two double 4 poster beds, modern large bathroom, TV, minibar, safe and wifi. I highly recommend you taking the tour of the gallery the collection of art and artifacts are quite unbelievable. The hotel restaurant served excellent food and again great service.The staff also helped us to book our bike tour around the local villages and were also on hand to drive us in to Ubud when we wanted to go in to the town centre.If you want a quiet hotel away from the hustle and bustle then this is definitely the one!
Rachel B|5EE1E15B8F304313D7451933011C1AAD|Attractions|Ubud: Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary|4| “Cheeky Monkeys!”|review_461936381|Ubud is very hot and humid so definitely recommend the walk in the morning. The monkeys are fearless and will attempt to get in your bag if you open it or draw attention to it. We followed the advice/instructions - ie removed sunglasses, no food and closed our bags and weren't bothered by them except a baby one which had a go at our rucksack, but that was my own fault as I brought attention to it by opening it for my camera. The monkeys are cute and it is nice to see them interact with each other. The trees are impressive as well.

Good points; central location, nice and helpful staff and a good pool. Bad points; breakfast average, renovation/extension work, room full of mosquitoes, very small windows in the room making it feel smaller and also the decor was very worn. Obviously you wouldn't normal spend a lot of time in your room, but my husband had an attack of Bali belly so was confined to the room for 2 days. Good value for money as we got a deal through Air Asia, but wouldn't stay again.

In arrival at the hotel lobby we were driven in a golf buggy down to the river valley where the restaurant was located, which was good fun. The restaurant have mosquito repellent on hand, but do be mindful that it is by the river. I liked the fact that it wasn't a set menu and they even had gluten free bread which was warm and pretty tasty. They had a local band playing Christmas songs, decor was tasteful and not over the top. Great food we enjoyed all of our courses and wine. Recommend the irish coffees!

There were better tables available to watch the show, but I think you needed to reserve these and pay extra. Good local cuisine, good wine menu and attentive staff. Highly recommend

Last time I stayed in a standard cabin with no ensuite, this visit we chose the ensuite option. However the ensuite was outside the cabin; the shower and toilet facilities were very clean and you could lock them. Cabin was clean and comfortable. They have air con, bedding, towels and basic kitchen facilities. Free wifi is also available. The holiday park has a great swimming pool area, kitchen area and bbq points for guests to use. For children there is a playground area. Staff were very helpful during our stay; even letting us stay in our cabin for a few extra hours without charge whilst we waited for our flight. Definitely recommend this holiday park it is reasonably priced and in the entertainment book. It is walking distance to restaurants, pubs and the visitors centre and has good staff and facilities. I am sure I will be back again.

Food is excellent. The main menu is sharing plates, but if you are not good at sharing, then there are pizzas and a couple of larger meals to choose from. I love the sharing plates and the staff are great at assisting you with your choices. Tuesday nights they hold a silent pub quiz great fun if you join in and if you don't you wouldn't even know a quiz was on, so no intrusion. Great idea!Big central bar so if you just want a drink you can.

This is also the area that is dog friendly; we regularly take our dogs with us. Food is very good! The gluten free pizzas are well cooked and feel as close to a normal pizza as I think you can get. The hubby always has steak and has found medium rare is medium rare! Good local pub good with a great atmosphere with or without your dog

I always think how unique the landscape is the colours and structures are like nothing I've ever seen.There is an informative visitors centre to help explain how the Pinnacles were formed and a gift shop where you can buy coffee, cold drinks, ice cream and souvenirs. It is $12 to get in to the park. Once in you can either be lazy and drive round getting out at viewing points or there is a gentle walk that you can do if you are feeling more active. The heat will probably be a main factor in your decision! Great place to stop if you are passing by, but even if you are in Perth and have time to make the 2 hour drive it is worth seeing.

Bus is a little small, but it didn't take away from the day and the driver was fantastic and very knowledgeable. This trip is worth every penny.We were picked up in central Melbourne and had morning tea in a little town called Colac. First landmark we saw was the London Bridge where we stopped for 15 mins to take in the view, we then went on to Loch Ard Gorge where we had longer time to walk around, really beautiful spot. Then we headed to the 12 Apostles where we had an hour, we had lunch here and there was an opportunity to go up in a helicopter for those who had pre-booked. There is a steady walk around the cliffs to take in the views of the Apostles. It is a busy place with lots of posing and selfies!We then moved on to Mait's rest forest tour again an easy 30 min walk the guide was entertaining and new his stuff. The trees were amazing to see.We then had a toilet break at a seaside town and on to my favourite part of the day....Koalas! I got to see my first wild koalas on this trip. In fact one was sat on the crash barrier looking out to the ocean! Our guide said he had never seen anything like it before! At Kennett River there were also a lot of parrots which are clearly used to being fed as they were jumping on some of the other tourists.We then drove along the rest of the Ocean Drive Road and had a photo opportunity at the Memorial Park Gates. One last stop for pizzas in Torquay and back to Melbourne for about 7.30pm All in all a very memorable day and thanks to a great driver and tour guide Definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Melbourne and has a spare day.

The breakfast was brilliant and filled me up until my evening meal! The seating is mainly a tressel table so be prepared to sit in close proximity to other diners, something my old parents were not keen on! But for younger people with their partner or friends you will love it. Great food and atmosphere, we were there on a Sunday morning and it was busy.

The view is beautiful, food and service was excellent! I would definitely recommend Watershed to anyone visiting Margaret River. Only one slight negative was the air con, it was an exceptionally hot day. We were sat at the bottom end of the restaurant so fantastic views, but the cool air did not reach us.
Rachel B|5EE1E15B8F304313D7451933011C1AAD|Hotel|Bourdeilles: Chateau De La Cote|3| “Beautiful Chateau”|review_340566342|I have mixed feelings about the Chateau the building is very grand and the grounds are beautiful, but the amenities are lacking. The breakfast was average at best: we had to ask for milk which was difficult because the server kept disappearing and the fruit salad was still frozen in parts. The bar is pretty much non existent. We didn't eat in the restaurant.We were there for a wedding which was amazing and the service on the day was brilliant.I would definitely recommend it for weddings. The town it is near is a beautiful example of a small french town. With a river circling it, cafe culture and markets on certain days. If you want to experience a French chateau I definitely recommend this place and stay in one of the suites. But be prepared and take your own soft drinks and snacks. Also skip breakfast!

Good shared kitchen facilities with a kitchen and bbq points, which were clean and tidy. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The holiday park is in a great location for easy access to the town centre and there is a pub and bottle shop across the road, which is a walking distance. I would stay again, but think I would pay for the deluxe cabin so we could have an ensuite room.

The service was excellent throughout our meal and the food was very good. Great place if you like BBQ food! Great wine too at a very reasonable price. In fact the whole menu was very reasonable. We sat outside at the back and it was a really nice atmosphere with the water in the background noise. This restaurant is deceiving from the front as it doesn't look that much, but the seating out back is really nice in the evening. I definitely recommend the ice cream for dessert!
Rachel B|5EE1E15B8F304313D7451933011C1AAD|Hotel|Tuaran: Shangri-La’s Rasa Ria Resort & Spa|5| “Pure luxury!”|review_243982701|Our holiday was amazing from start to finish! We were picked up from the airport by the hotel driver and then it was about a 30 min drive, with cool face towels and water to help you freshen up. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, always smiling and saying hello as they went about their duties. The food was excellent and there was a great choice of different nationalities food, so you did not have to eat the same thing. We booked at the Coast restaurant and had the candlelit meal on the beach, it was very romantic and the food and service were both beyond our expectations! So much so that we ate there again on our last night. The hotel has a lot of activities to keep you occupied we took advantage of the spa treatment (the massages were very relaxing), the bike ride to a traditional village, diving and of course the Orangutan sanctuary. The Orangutans are really special. The pool area was great and definitely recommend the coconut water drinks. Our room was excellent, really well designed. We had forgotten our electrical adapter, but we didn't need one as the plug sockets were designed so that any plug could fit it, which is genius! If you want complete luxury away from the main town then this is the hotel for you and even if you are an active person there are plenty of things for you to do.

Room was pretty small, but it was clean and served its purpose. We stayed over the bank holiday weekend and were told there would be no towel service on the Sunday, which I thought was odd, but a pleasant stay all in all.

Rachel B|5EE1E15B8F304313D7451933011C1AAD|Hotel|Margaret River: Heritage Trail Lodge|4| “Peaceful, but still walking distance to the town”|review_243979175|The Heritage Trail Lodge is one of the first accommodation you drive past when driving in to Margaret River. Surrounded by trees it is very peaceful place to stay and it is only a 10 min walk in to Margaret River town centre. The owners were very accommodating and were very helpful with my gluten free diet at breakfast time. The rooms were very spacious and the bathroom with the spa bath was a great treat! I loved the DVD library which was available to all guests free of charge.I would definitely recommend the lodge to anyone wanting some where close to Margaret River town centre. I also saw my first wild possums, in the garden at night time!

The fish are beautiful and multi-coloured. We were also blessed with finding a Green Turtle and he was more than happy for us to swim alongside him for a while.

The day was absolutely amazing from start to finish, as the day approached I had been excited and a little nervous, but the crew were amazing at putting you at ease and any swimmer level would be more than able to join in the fun. The whole day is provided for you get picked up from your hotel taken to the boat, breakfast, drinks, lunch and champagne to toast the day! On board they also have wet suits, snorkels and fins for those that need them. On our first venture in the water we saw an Eagle Ray, which was the start of our day, it was beautiful and we were told we had been very fortunate to see one. We then went on to see 5 whale sharks and then on the last swim we were able to swim with 3 Manta rays. The Whale Sharks were absolutely beautiful creatures, they completely surpassed all of my expectations and the Manta Ray are so playful and graceful. The water is amazingly warm its like bath water! Once the crew had tired us out we slowly sailed back to the jetty, whilst on our way back we were looking for marine life and saw a Tiger Shark, Turtle and Dolphins. Thank you to Ningaloo Blue for an amazing experience and we will hopefully be back next year!

The setting over looking the hotel grounds and the sea in the distance is definitely the high point of the restaurant. The services was really good, our waiter was very helpful. The food was good. Be aware of mosquitos, during the meal I was bitten 3 times! But to be fair to the restaurant they do have signs up warning guests and they do have spray on hand if you wish to use it, I unfortunately saw the sign after the event!

Rachel B|5EE1E15B8F304313D7451933011C1AAD|Attractions|Exmouth: Birds Eye View Ningaloo|5| “Unforgettable View and Experience!”|review_208987504|I booked with Birds Eye View after a friend recommended we did it whilst in Ningaloo, I am so glad we followed their advice. The flight was absolutely exhilarating and I am scared of heights!! Gavin the pilot is very passionate about his work and as other reviewers have said his passion is infectious, but he is also very professional and you feel 100% safe at all time.Gavin provides excellent in flight entertainment and music! The flight would be amazing just to have a go, but at Ningaloo you are also blessed with the most beautiful views, the colour of the Ningaloo Reef just doesn't seem real and the view point of the marine life from high above is amazing. If you are visiting Ningaloo /Exmouth you have to book this flight!! Gavin thank you so much for such an awesome experience I will always remember it.
Rachel B|5EE1E15B8F304313D7451933011C1AAD|Hotel|Monkey Mia: RAC Monkey Mia Dolphin Resort|4| “Great for a long weekend”|review_202712272|We drove up to Monkey Mia from Perth and stayed at the resort for 4 nights. We were staying in one of the beach view rooms with a balcony over looking the bay. The room was clean, but basic and one of the days the toilet gave off a terrible smell, which I imagine is due to the location being remote. When the AC was on the balcony shook, which didn't make it very relaxing! The rooms were expensive for what they are and that was with discount via the Entertainment book! You are definitely paying for the location and dolphins! Our stay was over Easter the camping area looked very cramped, however, once we were in our room and on the beach it didn't feel overcrowded except for the Dolphin feeding times! It is a memorable experience to see wild dolphins close up, but the feeding slots definitely brings out the worse in people! People do not listen to the Rangers about the rules when interacting with the dolphins and will push themselves to the front in a hope they will be chosen to feed the dolphins. However, if you avoid the morning feeds, you still can see lots of dolphins playing and feeding close to the shore. There are also resident turtles, emus and pelicans. So lots of wildlife to be seen.The Boughshed restaurant offered good food and service, but there are no other choices unless you eat in the Monkey Bar. (We did not want to do self catering)

Our room was clean and surprisingly quiet at night. The buffet breakfast was not worth the price. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, they definitely made our stay and for that I would be happy to stay there again when I am next passing through.
