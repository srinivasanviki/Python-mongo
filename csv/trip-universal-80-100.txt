Shanza H|None|5 April 2017|One of a kind |5|A2B9C7E54858C5070ED8E2BCECA3CA23|I thoroughly enjoyed this theme park. They have all the rides an amusement park needs. Great place to go with family and friends. Good for all ages. Though/001 for most of the rides we have to wait for 30 minutes/001 minimum. It's better to buy the fast pass/001 it made my trip more enjoyable.
A TripAdvisor Member|None|5 April 2017|Fun getaway with kids|5|None|Shouldn't miss the rides/001 and the foods. Queues are terrible but it's all worth it. Roller coaster and transformer are the best for me. Kids and adults will love the park itself
Ekta K|None|5 April 2017|wonderful adventure park|5|DBAC49AE90C556AE7912CB4225824584|wonderful adventure park to spend an entire day /001 although the place is crowded/001 yet it is worth the day /001transformers and mummy returns is a must experience ride. shrek is a lil boring.roller coaster takes you to another world/001 gives you an adrenaline rush altogether.
AIMEE127|Newcastle upon Tyne- United Kingdom|5 April 2017|Loved it |5|C2FA594544C755A28769B8E68BC77D32|So much fun! Get there early to avoid big lines Felt like a pair of big kids the whole time we were there!
Nikica M|Split-Dalmatia County- Croatia|4 April 2017|Funny place|4|02505E3C7EC785FCC3453E1235048083|Intresting place to visit/001 especially if you are with kids. My recomendation is not to skip WaterWorld and Transformers. Quality of the food could and should be better. Maybe is ok for asian people/001 but for me who don't like asian food so much it is not good. I refuse to eat and wait to go outside to find some good place to eat. Ah/001 almost forget. Marlin Monroe perfomane was excellent/001 I like it so much.
Ilze M|Cape Town Central- South Africa|4 April 2017|Must do!|5|7DE61B623520427A1EEB19E2662EFCBC|You cannot visit Singapore without going to Universal. The rides is amazing and there is something for everyone. We took our 2 year old and there is rides that he could do as well.
Charlotte S|Geneva- Switzerland|4 April 2017|Bad Experience to hard place|1|5DB2827D324FDED46ABB8883AE1F9AD5|If you like to wait many hours with a very hot heat temperature too hot ...Very hard experience for usFor each attraction you queue on average Minimum 45 min and up to 2 hrs for an attraction that lasts only 1 to 4 minutes !!Lots of customers and park poorly managedThe staff not professional and not friendly10% of staff speak English
vigindian|Singapore- Singapore|4 April 2017|Excellent|5|61C87F309DE9CB066EA4B29022B2D7CA|Pros:Many rides available.Transformers is the best ride (must visit)/001 according to me.1 full day can be spent inside.Many mascots in different locations at different times of the day.Cons:Anything sold inside is costly.Suggestions:Umbrella or hat must on a sunny day. I'd suggest to buy them in the city (7-eleven) as it's costly inside.
217arihantj|None|3 April 2017|Awesome Adventure Park|5|1882D82FF8C12D05E397099F347035B9|I HAve Never Been Into this type of adventure park/001 All The Rides Are Awesome and have there own enjoyment. They have all types of rides from Kids to Adult. This is the best place for age group people
Melb0urne13|Melbourne- Australia|3 April 2017|Worth the experience|3|01735D6AF52F93FD78FDCB230C4FAF1D|Spent the day at Universal and was put off straight away once we entered and went to go on the first ride/001 the guy at the entrance indicated that unsecured items should be put into lockers that were provided (which is fair enough)/001 however every locker we went to store our goods were sold out/001 we then had to find someone that represented the park to give us direction (good luck with that)/001 we eventually found two gents who were more than happy to help/001 they suggested to go back out and use the lockers situated just outside of the entrance/001 we found the lockers/001 then had trouble with inserting cash (again no one around to assist)/001 eventually had success on the last go/001 with all this we had missed an hour and a half/001 not to mention lining up at the que to get in again/001 by the way it costs 15 dollars for a small locker outside of the park opposed to 20 dollars max inside of the park. After the initial frustrating moments we went on the first ride (battle star Galactica) which took nearly 2 hours to get through/001 I did put this down to the lack of organisation when we eventually reached the ride/001 there was way too much delay in getting people off and on (the rest of the rides were super organised)/001 I understand the safety component/001 however this was due/001 in my opinion/001 poor team work (besides the ride was average). after this ride we went nearly all the major rides (I think a few people have mentioned after lunch)/001 which did not take over 30 minutes to get on (transformers 15 mins after lunch)/001 and found the organisation between these teams excellent. We have been to Universal in LA/001Knotsberry Farm in Anaheim/001 Movie world and Dreamword/001 in Queensland/001 although you can not compare these to Singapore (which is overall expensive)/001 although comparing prices for entry and food/001 fairly much the same across the board. As we were first timers here/001 I would suggest cater for the whole day here and don't forget to get your tickets from the MRT for 4 dollars each return/001 this is situated on the third floor of the Vivo centre. Best attraction for us was Transformers.
Debra B|Doha- Qatar|3 April 2017|Fun Day|4|F0CD8821614D32C323564E395A3BDD43|Easy online booking/001 organised and clean park/001 can re-enter if you want to eat elsewhere/001 didn't need express pass midweek/001 Shrek ride disappointing/001 Transformers brilliant. Well worth a visit.
SandraZGG|Zaragoza- Spain|3 April 2017|Halloween experience|4|8897BA52518CBE5110187AB6327A5C24|I went to Universal Studios Singapore in Halloween/001 where there were special horror attractions/001 and it was very funny and frightening. I recomment to buy an express pass due to the long queues/001 otherwise you will lose a lot of time!
Prasanth P|None|2 April 2017|Superb experience!!!!|5|9D80A7F34C3B2D273884F83862BEE5C4|We really enjoyed uss. The theme park is well constructed and well maintained. The rides are awesome. Main attractions are transformers/001 mummy returns/001 shrek. Try to go on weekdays.
Dystryer|Santiago- Chile|2 April 2017|Good visit for a trip of more than 5 days to Singapore|4|30386CE5484FF549D8ADFD7F8092E02E|This park is really near and accessible from the city center. It´s smaller and cheaper than the other Universal Studios around the world. If you have an express pass you can do it in less than a day.
Tawha A|Lahore |2 April 2017|First time to Universal Studios|3|7E85463F12906B7294DDCB70A5D37E0B|Below is my experience:Cons1. Best for kids.2. Too crowded and long queues. Better go on weekdays.3. Expensive ticket.4. OverratedPros1. Lots of rides. All sort of rides for everyone.2. Plenty of places to eat around.3. Clean and easy to go. Get to Vivo City by MRT (Harbour Front) and then take Sentosa Express.

Calmday|Perth- Australia|2 April 2017|Time for an update.|3|35377EC4D2EFF791385B2449FC8E883C|Universal Singapore is still very good but age is starting to show on some of the attractions. The same attractions that are there year after year. Universal might consider changing out some of the rids and attractions with something new. With all of that said. It's still definitely worth going if you find yourself in Singapore with kids. If you can afford to spend a little more/001 the express pass is worth it.
GDE1973|Moscow- Russia|2 April 2017|Be aware of the long lines|2|F315666246AD94CDEE4314FC39EB78F2|Nice to go with kids/001 but I would strongly avoid weekends and public holidays due to the incredible long lines for a 5 minute ride. How can they ask to stay in line for 60 minutes for 5 minutes of fun... not balanced at all. They should restrict the number of visitors. Like this there is no value for the time spent (even the fast pass is not helping.
PriyaSuri|Chennai (Madras)- India|2 April 2017|Fun Day|5|12FEADA22B9312B020C725B1B524431F|We had a fabulous time and there were rides that my 4 year old could also enjoy. Getting the Express Pass really helped us. One can rent stroller here/001 which was quite useful. A brilliant place to have fun
Rekha N|None|1 April 2017|Fun fun fun|5|681D1B6AD175993433D24A3388B49ADA|Anyone who loves excitement/001 thrill/001 adventure in life must visit this place. Except for one roaller coaster twisting took all rides. It was mind blowing. My 9 yr son enjoyed it to the core. With good eatery joints inside you need not worry about carrying food items. A clean and well maintained place. One thing to definitely not miss would be Steven Spielberg Lights Camera Action section where they show you a glimpse of sound and special effects. All the other rides are good. Though the rates are on a little higher side but worth it. Please reach the venue on time so that you can cover the entire thing in a day.
Teenz888|Darwin- Australia|1 April 2017|Fun for all Ages|4|D32D9CE8C2B97C0AD112EA8C7CBD38B4|My first Universal Studios Experience and it was a blast for any movie buff. Clean and helpful staff with great sets that will amaze you. Some tips for a great day:1. Start early when its less crowded.2. Buy a priority pass (SD$30.00) but it believe me its the difference between 5 mins and sometimes 50mis in a queue. This is a must during school holidays or weekends.3. Not much dining options mostly fried food. But you can get pass-outs to eat in Sentosa and then go back inside.4. Do the Jurrasic Ride as one of your last ones because you can get pretty wet (especially your shoes)5. Wear comfortable shoes.6. Do the Water World show /001 Check the times that its on and dont miss out.7. People will try to cut the line/001 just be assertive and polite in addressing this and if they succeed in forcing their way/001 don't let it ruin your day (but you shouldn't get this problem if you get a priority pass).
Helmi A|None|1 April 2017|Not worth the money!!!!|1|5ED61F412131084230670B7F9CD2A43E|Very expensive attraction. Beverages and souvenir very expensive. Very boring rides. Very very very long queue. This theme park is more concern about making a snake like queues. Never ending qieues. Long queues will make all the guest felt tired and also felt like giving up of coming to the USS AGAIN. Queue for nearly 1 bour while the rides only last for as long as 2 min. So dissappointing and miserable theme park ever.USS management should limit the number of guest coming to USS to avoid dissappointment among the guests. USS management also should not just think of making money for their own interest without thinking of the guests feeling. This will be my first and last trip to USS. Those guest who read this might want to think twice before coming here.
silviafini|Jakarta- Indonesia|31 March 2017|Okay|5|F920AD4198D6166AB87DE7A23E1B27E6|Nice theme park/001 a lot of rides/001 my favorite was The Mummy. It's not too big but it's so crowded/001 and I went there not on the weekend. Tired of queuing.
Hans A|None|31 March 2017|Great technology  but not for a thriller seeker|3|C8F355E65D011CD6E3B8A432C7F316AB|First/001 I should be honest that the technology and design in this amusement park is really great. But so sorry/001 the attraction is more appropriate for kids. They only have battlestar galactica and mummy revenge for thriller seeker/001 I even can said both is not really scary.. you will see a lot of children (about 7 years old) go to this ride/001 it means that it is not too scary for kids. Another good attraction is transformer/001 but that's awesome because of the technology/001 good but not scary at all.. another attraction is just like a kid's toys or modern doll house. Nice/001 but not for a thriller seeker. You also should be patient in facing unfriendly staff. Most of them is really annoying/001 their expression shows if they are too tired and always tell everything in a hurry. Not recommended for thriller seeker/001 but recommended for family and adult who loves relaxing attraction.. hope they will build another serious thrilling attraction for adult and teach their staff to be more friendly.
icosmosenterprise|Petaling Jaya- Malaysia|31 March 2017|A Fun Day|5|DD7C9F6A616F3C7E70BC603BD81B7792|Overall a good day out at USS. Almost the same with US LA.We went there on Wednesday/001 and the crowd is still a lot.We able to complete most of the rides on time.The Roller Coaster is a long queue/001 but worth it.The Shrek4D waiting time is a bit too long.The Mummy ride is awesome. We love it.The best is still the Waterworld Show. A must go show. Don't miss this.The actors and actresses are so awesome and funny. 5 stars performance.Rocketfella is a bit boring.Sesame Street show is quite ok.Food is just normal.We used a SGD5 meal voucher that came with the tickets that we bought online.
Sk G|Singapore- Singapore|31 March 2017|Compact space but quality of fun is in top-notch.|5|FEB9BA9DF6AE9B7B9C0FD97B74DA8E11|We didn't expect the fried chicken of Goldilocks at Far Far Away can taste so lip-smacking good. We are flexible and open to anything in the park. Glad we all burned our energy there and didn’t meltdown during the Transformers rides.
Karan S|Chandigarh- India|31 March 2017|An Amazing Getaway for individuals  couples  groups  families & others!|5|6A86EF4B16B2B59E9F84C58AF788CB34|An amazing place to spend several hours to an entire day/001 regardless of whether you are on a solo trip/001 with your partner/001 friends/001 or family (not sure about pets!). You can try different rides/001 different cuisines/001 shop at different movie merchandise stores and above all/001 have quality fun time! A must visit for every tourist visiting Singapore :)
Kilt_in_Action|None|31 March 2017|a bit of escapisim and great big scary rides|4|AB865CF7168DDF0D273C506B6473F5C7|We went on a Sunday and I think we were really lucky with the queues/001 the longest we had to wait was around 20 minutes/001 it was obvious there was potential it could have been much longer. We were able to get around all the rides we wanted (my partner and I/001 no kids) and have a leisure couple of leisurely meals. The rides were great/001 loved the battle star galactica ones and the I loved the transformers 3D thing/001 that was a real surprise. The food is expensive/001 if you're on a tight budget bring some snacks/lunch.
debbieR9195TF|Sydney- Australia|31 March 2017|Small but fun|3|7BE95096010944B9B01D46527473E660|I have visited Universal in US and Japan/001 enjoyed this one but seemed smaller than the others.Buy the express pass as it gets very busy and without one the shortest queue was 50min/001 the express pass was $30 dollars on top of admission.
Gaurang K|Mumbai (Bombay)- India|31 March 2017|Good fun for everyone|4|9B2EE0CC4221C136B7A62ADCE602C5DF|Singapore trip will never be complete without a visit to Universal Studios. Always keep a day for this.There are rides for all ages. A must visit.
EmJay2010|Gold Coast- Australia|31 March 2017|So Much Fun!!|5|CE6A120275D8F2F5B1D0E5756E92F60B|Have been to Universal Studios in LA before and knew this one was going to be smaller. Yes it was small but jam packed with so much fun and so many different rides. The Water World show is a must to go see/001 get there early for splash zone seats. All the rides were awesome/001 lines not too big and maximum we waited was around 30 minutes/001 especially late afternoon it was very quiet. Lots of food choices in Universal or can go out to Sentosa to eat then come back in. I would definitely return when visiting Singapore again!
judith J|Liverpool- United Kingdom|30 March 2017|Great Day Out|5|1456733329AFFB3FF7726B84EC3C92E7|Spent a day at the park.Went on a Friday which was relatively quiet as we walked on most rides with a maximum 5 minute wait time.We purchased a ticket which included hotel pick up and transfer to the park/001 cost £86.00 for the two of us. Return vis the MRT Train system costing £3.50 for us both. That was to Orchard Road City Centre (Holiday Inn) . See separate review for that. If you made your own way to the park on the underground system the park entrance is only £33 each plus of course the £1.75 each train fare.This is a very small park in comparison to the USA/001 but still worth the entrance fee.Really easy to navigate round the park/001 you can go left or right on entry and the park is roughly in a circle.On average two rides per area and there are 6 areas to exploreThere are 4 thrill rides/001 one water rapid ride ( you will get wet/001 even soaked) The rest of the rides I would describe as family friendly.Other than the rides must do's are Shrek 4D Adventure and Waterworld Live stunt show ( a must see )Plenty of eateries/001 including ice cream stands catering for all tastes and dietary requirements. Cost of eating and drinking quite reasonable even though you are a captive audience. Note you can't bring your own food and drink in/001 your bag is searched on entry.All in all had a great day/001 spent about six hours here only stopping for a half hour lunch
Dmitriy B|None|30 March 2017|Don't go to transformers|1|06BA37837385CCDA5FAF6DC7FE5859B7|This is the hell on Earth. So dissatisfied/001 we lost 2 hours and it was bad. Never go here. Hey administrators/001 put exits on the way. We stuck in the middle while we want to save our time and go away. Never go here. Save your time and nerves.
wiiewulandari|Makassar- Indonesia|30 March 2017|Uss|5|33C6A361679B20ACB3FFB879CD3E1D66|Very good attraction for those looking for some fun. Everything is safety at all. Surely will come again
wacky_shruti|Mumbai (Bombay)- India|30 March 2017|Awesome place|5|F6A8133E1798AD662C42A6986C816DF0|Loved the rides - human/001 cylon & mummy.. the water world and spielberg shows are absolutely brilliant.. even the 4D shows are good.. kids will absolutely love the place
SaketSaraogi|Mumbai (Bombay)- India|30 March 2017|Awesome |5|F9EB12A050E2F98D316B2D2391C7C525|Awesome is the one word for this place. It's beautiful and clean. Activities are very nice and helps increase adrenaline to the core.
Niranjan L|None|29 March 2017|This place is all about thrill...OMG|4|A66C0D49642C0190459EB23BF3789C9B|Especially if you are travelling with teenage kids you need a place to keep them entertained. This universal studio is the right place to keep them occupied. Need at least a whole day to have some fun here otherwise you will be missing out on heaps of things. Please make sure you buy your tickets through the taxi driver its cheaper than buying through the agent. I am a big fan of roller coaster and they have some awesome 1s too. The live show at the water world is great if you are into loud noise gun fires canon balls and water splashes...food and drink is quite expensive inside. Overall it is a great place...my teenager enjoyed his day and always talks about it.
ashed007|Mumbai (Bombay)- India|29 March 2017|the real thing|4|11EA4CE512F1A373EA7766CE809A52EB|fantastic theme based rides/001 very crowded/001 but one can manage to satisfy all age groups in half a day. seems like the lines for the adult roller coasters thin out during the late evening. The shows are good/001 pick your favourite.Best if you can afford a full day/001 otherwise combine with SEA aquarium/001 or some other attraction of your choice.
deborah_schramm|Bunbury- Australia|29 March 2017|Great family entertainment|5|3050D0ECFCCA9A9B1DAA68B22BD4A564|There are great rides and shows suitable for a variety of tastes. Staying at least 5 hours will ensure you have a number of rides and see some shows. Best to do the rides you want to do first off as crowds build up towards lunch time. Late afternoon is less crowded so you can go out and come back in. Do not forget a cap or some sun screen as it can get hot. There are water fountains where you can fill up.
ylvateleman|Malmo- Sweden|29 March 2017|Magical!|5|672ADACD362F09CBAF33B4E835680F34|We had an amazing day/001 and this is a must if you like roller coasters! They have 5 really good rides/001 3 of them roller coasters/001 one is the Transformers 3D ride and one a water rapid. They have lots of other roller coasters/001 shows and rides but they are more for kids or people who like calmer rides. The queues can be quite long/001 and in case of thunderstorm they will close most of their rides and this not being an unusual happening in Singapore be prepared to take a break in the afternoon. If you don't like queuing I recommend buying an express pass for just 30 dollars.The best thing about this place is that it is not just a theme park/001 the decoration and atmosphere is magical! Don't expect though too many rides/001 but look forward to a really wonderful experience.
NakedchefBildeston|Bildeston|29 March 2017|Great day out don't miss water world|5|52C3B375AE4546D243AEF371F34DC007|You could easily spend the whole day here. There is only a 5 big rides but still plenty of other things to do. I would arrive when it opens as queues were quite short until midday and book tickets online to avoid queuing for tickets when you arrive. Battle star Cylon was the best ride but mummy and transformers are great fun too. Water world the show is not to be missed it was a highlight of the day.
MohitJalan|Ranchi|28 March 2017|Nice place|5|2C270C852122B1989A36FB69C12440D0|Great place for everyone but keep in mind all the rides have height restrictions so have an arrangement so that some one can care your child while u enjoy the places
RyanRainValiant|None|28 March 2017|VERY GOOD|4|B5619275270BCFA805F7738CD59BDDB5|Me and my wife coming here for celebrate new year time.Big/001 good and must visit if you are going to sentosa island.Many attraction to see in building or just outside at the street watch live show.Sometimes with limited time you can find cartoon character at the street and you can take a picture together.A little bit pricey for entrance and for the food/001 but still affordable with a awasome place like this.Some advice to management/001 maybe they can reduce the visitor.Because at some attraction/001 you must waiting more than one hour and that is not confortable specially for a kids.
ravi a|None|28 March 2017|AWESOME|5|F9E3B64A102EE8070BEB44EE599AB76D|Amazing Place . The Idea Is Nice And Needs A Whole Day To Explore . Thriller Rides And Dancing Mummies /001 Transformers Etc. This Place Has Everything .
Iain M|None|28 March 2017|Very small|3|7D55EB0E67BF1960438CBB8D739A8557|A fun half day at best. Very small and rides are quite short compared to the length of queues. Recommend express pass..otherwise you will spend a whole day there...queuing! Worth a visit but manage expectations accordingly and you will have fun.
Kul_Kapoli|Bengaluru- India|28 March 2017|Take your time to see this !!!|5|36BC0069CA8381DF6C5F0DE0659524C3|It is very vast and too many things to see. Plan it and go around accordingly so that you don't miss any attraction. Wear light clothing and flat shoes as you have to walk a lot. Lot of sun screen and definitely a cap. Things not to miss/001 Galactica/001 Transformers/001 Lost world boat ride and the few performances that happen at regular interval.
Merv3102|Los Angeles- California|28 March 2017|Best ride ever |5|7700CC9728A545E5D142425DA3CCB8A1|USS is one of the best attractions ever..The rides were simply the best..my kids love the transformer rides. It's good to buy the express pass so that saves time. Can spend a day at this attraction.
ozmig5|Perth- Australia|27 March 2017|Beats any theme park available in Australia |4|21D6D7BCF2BB270CA08745D3E04244CA|As someone who spent formative years (and some adult ones) living in the US I am very hard to please when it comes to theme parks. On this occasion I was bringing my 10yo who has no memory of visiting a decent theme park (including her first birthday spent at Disneyland in Anaheim). I know this is one of the smaller Universal parks so I was focussed on having my daughter just enjoy whatever was on offer given she really had nothing to compare it to. However I found this park to be better than my expectations and it definitely delivered for my 10yo who went from being terrified of roller coasters to a hardcore lover of them in only one day at Universal Studios Singapore. Favourites were definitely Revenge of the Mummy/001 Transformers and Battlestar Galactica (both sides) - and the Rapids ride in Jurassic Park was a great way to warm up to the more thrilling stuff and to cool off in the tropical heat simultaneously. Great atmosphere/001 fairly decent food and good staff made for a very memorable day for us. Would definitely visit again.
welcomeMumbai|mumbai|27 March 2017|Scenic views |5|E4B0454B56678DA25CA88CC79F17A960|Enjoy the Scenic views from Great heights from the Tiger Sky tower which is approximately 130 metres above sea level. Tiger Sky Tower brings you to the peak of Sentosa island.

Margherita L|Perth- Australia|27 March 2017|Good day of fun|4|77FD1A3AEB3AC5563A82C504932AAE27|Although we are an older couple we enjoyed our day at Universal Studios. We went on most rides. We found the rapids ride quite boring. And we got soaked. Couldn't see the reason for the ride doing this other than to make it interesting.
SpecialBirthday|Adelaide- Australia|27 March 2017|Fun  fun  fun|4|4041EB97164172EEB9DF7328CCA8009C|We had a day of fun on Sentosa Island after deciding to visit Universal Studios. It is very easy to catch the MRT to VivoCity Shopping Centre and the monorail out to Sentosa. We were amazed at the choice of rides/001 shows/001 shops and events to visit at Universal Studios. We found there was something to see in each section of the Park and thoroughly enjoyed the day. Would recommend the Waterworld Show and the Transformers Ride. Enjoy !
Threefingered|None|27 March 2017|Great for kids and adults alike|5|552DAF0FE794187F4A3C549844CC2C26|My wife and enjoyed a whole day at the Universal Studio. The place is made very well and the adult rides are quite thrilling and exhilarating.The most enjoyable for me was the Cylon.Don't forget to take the priority pass for bit extra so that you won't have wait in lines much.We will be back soon.

You better visit USS in weekdays/001 so you can try almost all rides there. Some rides are too long in queue/001 so we skipped it and go on to another rides.
Tram P|None|27 March 2017|Huge & modern play ground|5|A94E35EF8C1B24F540EA3E2992EDF930|My day in Universal is one of the highlights in my Singapore trip. It's huge/001 modern/001 safe/001 creative and detailed. This place seems to be for everyone/001 there are performances for kids/001 highly challenging game rooms for adults and street performances for every one. Moreover/001 souvenir shops are everywhere and people will find these souvenirs nowhere but Universal Singapore. I like this way of selling souvenirs/001 dont like something sold everywhere with tourists.
Verry S|None|27 March 2017|Nevet enough attractions |5|9B9B1F0A1F64051470F128D8A0B8ED0D|This holiday in USS not to crowded. A perfect sunny day with kids to enjoy the place. Located in the resort world sentosa can reach by monorel or just walk if you stay at resort world The famous attraction is transfsormer ride took this 4 times. The place full of amazing attraction for kids include Madagascar show and also the fireworks at closing time. Avoiding long Q you can take an express pass for additional SD 50. So many restaurant here cost 7-12 dolars for one menu. Drinks 3.4 - 6 dolars. Store and gifts available here realy enjoy the place
Markus L|Skelleftea- Sweden|26 March 2017|This is a play ground!|5|926148557857D5086E4ABD1CDC7B4256|I love it/001 this is a place you have to go to if you are in Singapore it doesnt matter how old you are/001 here you have so much fun for ewery one!

Rishi K|Hyderabad- India|26 March 2017|Awesome experience|5|7CE8205F8511F5DD8710672D8490CFC0|Universal studios is among the top places you must go if you are visiting Singapore. Though the entrance charges may be on the higher side at $72/001 you should not miss this. you can spend the whole day there. The rides are great/001 specially battle star Galactica. Awesome experience
David P|Batemans Bay- Australia|26 March 2017|Not so good|3|89D9FD1F2984FF5B6C57B7C548066E62|We have been here before and we paid a bit extra to purchase the Priority Pass so we did not have to wait in line up to 45 minutes . We notice that the entrance fee and the Priority Pass had all gone up in price. The Priority pass is now $50SG each. We still purchased them .On entering the park we went on our favourite ride /001 Madagascar . love this ride /001 so much fun. We then began working our way around the park and discovered something. Not all the rides have priority pass . In fact 4 of our favourite attractions did not let us have priority . If we had been told this we would not have bought them . This put a dampener on the day and we only stayed for a couple of hours . Will not come again
astventures|Singapore- null- Singapore|26 March 2017|Birthday trip|4|5BE61C6CF648185AB085A0441126729A|Its my 4th time here. The best part is that the service and amenities were impeccable and didn't dropped even a bit. But it can help if we have a new attraction.
ElyKalysa|Singapore- Singapore|25 March 2017|Excellent|5|809D782B477B6E4F0A485234EC0E1C18|Not my first visit and definitely more to come! This theme park is definitely a good place for family and friends.

simplyshivam|Gurugram (Gurgaon)- India|25 March 2017|Universal|4|A644E14BBA23E8D58D9A74622B04A19E|Universal is just a 2 Km walks from vivo MRT station /001/001 it gives a good walks and nce breeze on the sea. The theme park is good comparable to disneyland but much smaller.Always go for transformers and Mummy ride
AlunHutoyo|Surabaya- Indonesia|25 March 2017|Play like you never grow up 😀|5|B9C98A6CD56F03953E85A392D335D9EE|Mummy and Transformer attractions are the best! You need to spare one full day to try all the attractions. Avoid to come here on weekeng because it will be crowded and long queue.
JennaTassie|Launceston- Australia|25 March 2017|Pretty good!|4|D888E040040609298837DE3D236558C9|As a mid 20's person it wasn't the best theme park. Would be better with a family. However my sister and I still loved it! Quite possible to do in a day/001 various ride levels.

SanthoshMohanan|Bengaluru- India|23 March 2017|Its awesome day spent in universal studios|4|E028C1A2EF9A1741F468A81CDA1F348A|We (my wife and kid 9 yrs) had an awesome time in Universal Studios. I've been to the Universal Studios in LA/001 U.S and thought this may not be so interesting. But i found this equally good but just that it is not as big.The best is the 4D experience of transformers which my wife and kid were just clapping while they were experiencing the 4D experience.The kids will love it with many rides and food options. This is one day well spent sometime you may get tired walking around a bit but its a good experience for kids and adults alike.
Nickos_1971|Antwerp Province- Belgium|23 March 2017|Good for families with little children|3|24DC1393DC09B5D5ECDF6CC705D22874|We heard about Universal Studios being not that great for adults but we wanted to see it for ourselves. We had fun but indeed/001 this theme park is more for families with little children. For adults the attractions are kinda ok/001 real thrillseekers are probably very disappointed. We went on a monday so the ques weren't that long which was super. Did the whole park in half a day/001 so it's quite a bit smaller than it's USA cousin.
coolsaintme|Mumbai (Bombay)- India|23 March 2017|Ride out!|5|B43FE3F1D3AC369AE56ECB33896FC0AA|They have the best rides in the house. You will love the live water act. Roller coaster is amazing which thrills. You will surely love the bel girls performance.
Ian C|None|23 March 2017|A "must visit" if you happen to be in Sentosa. |4|2349E8D1B5D647E76F11FFFEAC5A6A37|It's great for families and you wouldn't want miss it if you happen to be in Sentosa. It isn't the best Universal Studios if compared to the rest but it is definitely the best themepark in South East Asia.
Ehlly|Philippines|23 March 2017|Fun !!!|3|6393C082E9EABD0F139D235C3EB902E3|My favorite was transformer it was really cool and fun. You should not miss it. If you want to try the Water World I suggest if you don't have raincoat with you don't seat near the performance area coz you might be wet . Can't open umbrella and you cannot move to your seat once show started. It's a entertainment were have actors perform a story. Have lots of rides to try too. You should save energy before go here in Universal to make sure you can try all. They open at 10AM and close I think till around 1900. Better you eat first before go here coz food inside is kinda more expensive. Place is actullay not so huge but if have many people you need to spend more time waiting in the line. For us we started at 1300 then finished at 1700. So halfday will be fine I think.
sintah2017|Bekasi|23 March 2017|Staff Gathering|5|DE8ED0DBEDF897EECFF4C1F7967D84F1|Finally/001 we held staff gathering in Universal Studio Singapore.Very exciting and amusing. Even though the weather is very hot/001 we almost forget about it/001 because all the attraction is very amazing/001 especially Transformers the ride.Suggestion : would be very nice if the park provide restaurant that provides rice or noodle in it's menu with halal certificate.
acid4ss01|Singapore- Singapore|23 March 2017|ehhhhh|3|FC48FC3C54692587D29F2720E2880E91|well i can say that overall this place is absolutely amazing and fun. but the thing is/001 the seats in the red and blue ride (cyclon and human) are kind of smelly. it would be amazing and perfect if u guys cleaned it ever hour or so.. it has other people's sweat and i think it is unhygienic and its hard to enjoy the rides/001 but overall it is really fun and exciting
Jessica R|None|23 March 2017|Awesome day with the Single Express Pass|4|610D77F88DDF60EC4E7F9EAC5599FDED|I think its definately worth paying that little bit extra to get the Single Ride Express Pass. We knew we'd only go on all the rides once/001 so this was perfect for us. We didnt have to wait and literally got on all the rides straight away. Made it a much better and funner experience.
Saïda O|None|23 March 2017|So much fun!|5|7C3B783E872F52F9F0A5BD35CFD222F1|This was the highlight of my trip to Singapore. We had so much fun/001 especially when riding the Cylon roller-coaster. I also liked the Transformers ride. I had the time of my life
SuitcaseLawyer|The Woodlands- Texas|22 March 2017|Universal Studios outside of the U.S. with no corners cut!!|5|D746D2820F740E0854BD91D55F4D2C7B|It was great to go to Universal Studios with my youngest of nephews. We had an amazing time enjoying many of the rides and attractions that they have available in Los Angeles or in Orlando.Please bear in mind that they do not have the Harry Potter world in Singapore nor do they sell items related to it. They are supposed to make this addition in the future but I don't know when. You will however find everything else. From Sesame Street/001 to the Minions/001 Shrek/001 Battlestar Galactica/001 the Mummy/001 Jurassic Park/001 etc.There is a Mel's Diner with U.S. fare/001 as well as other dining options. It may be a but smaller than the one in LA/001 and obviously there is no back lot tour. You will enjoy this park.It is located in Sentosa Island easily accesible by subway/001 monorail or taxi.
varchassri|New Delhi- India|21 March 2017|Good entertaining place|4|6CDCA481D0C6A39890E044D74224A13C|Our visit to this place was quite exciting. They conduct main water shows that start around 1330 hrs. Apart they have other in house shows that keep running through out the day. There are lot of street performances.One can enjoy boat rides/001 rubber boat rides/001 roller coaster rides/001 restaurants and much more. A nice experience for around 4 to 5 hours. This place is best suited for youngsters and with children. Entertaining place indee/001
gothicladie|Port Douglas- Australia|21 March 2017|Rides|4|575D0BE6301EC9110BFC6DB9F1CC93A4|Had a good day out there/001 very clean/001 had fun/001 some of rides were shut i.e. Water park rides/001 ......
alvinleereviews|Singapore- Singapore|21 March 2017|Perfect.|5|5A6ABA213D845C6DDD4D3DDF181D37DF|Great rides and attractions. Went for the cylon/human multiple times as we had express passes and would definitely visit again!
A TripAdvisor Member|None|20 March 2017|Theme Park with Awesome Rides|5|None|Been here quite a few times with family and friends. The rides are fantastic. Do plan to go during weekdays and non peak seasons as the queue for rides might takes up to 1 hour. Its a must ride for me for Transformer ride/001 mummy roller coaster/001 rapid adventure boat ride/001 flying canopy/001 puss in boots mini rollercoaster. Its a must watch for the waterworld show and Sherk 4D show. The rest of the attraction can take it if you have the time. I will always go for the shortest waiting time first as the queuing time will change sometimes will be shorter half hour later. But usually after 6pm/001 most of the attraction will have lesser people queuing as most of them went home already.
NeverHateEating|None|20 March 2017|Love Cylon Attractions|5|F56D3D07F9BC85693FD94AB83AD7BE8E|You have to ride this attractions whenever you are in Universal Studios Singapore. Besides this rode you have to try The Mummy Returns. But if you guys don't like adrenaline attractions/001 you can try another rides. Because in Universal Studios Singapore they have Variations ride that suits for kids or adults. To go here you can take a monorail from ViVo City.
Dian A|None|20 March 2017|Our Annual Escape|5|9D2AAA96156605D5CB42253D7A683616|Not too many people/001 not too crowded this time of the year/001 so it was really nice. Went on all the rides/001 the weather was good so all the rides were open and running! The Mummy ride was crazy fun! Try them all!
Ashiqur R|None|20 March 2017|WoW..|5|798CD6AD5206D8835EBB3B948DE205B0|In my opinion/001 it is the greatest place to visit in singapore..you should be there for whole day and avoid weekend for extra rush..
Neha_bhrt|None|20 March 2017|Best experience  Must visit|5|4C7AC0497B55A3F910A1BDA60FAA2D80|It was awesome fun to be here. This park is huge and everything is so amazing. All attractions/001 rides/001 live movie screening/001 so many movie characters/001 street shows. Transformers ride is not to be missed. Wonderful experience.
kimdanella|Quezon City- Philippines|19 March 2017|Best roller coaster ever|5|AADD2932092132548C796CBEAE1AD2D3|USS is so big that you need to be there upon the time it opens. Foods are quite expensive so I advice you to bring your own water/001 small bag/001 handkerchief & an extra shirt. Going there is easy because there's a free train from Vivo city to USS. There are free locker rentals for the extreme rides which covers usually around 30-40mins/001 just in time when you finish the ride. The "must-ride" there are The Mummy/001 Transformers/001 & Battlestar Galactica. There's a map that will be given to you & make sure that you ride everything so you enjoy what you paid for. Rides vary from extreme rides to shows for children.
suezie312|New York|19 March 2017|Interesting & Full of Fun|4|F741658E8F5A02899BB2F9CCEF208108|We visited USS for the first time. It was the super crowded but super fun/001 no less. My kids enjoyed all the rides. We didn't take the Battlestar Galactica though coz we were too scared. Haha. But the Transformers Ride was awesome! We will visit again soon. This time we will make sure we purchase the Express tickets as well to cut on queue time.
NickHtun|None|19 March 2017|One of the best place to visit|5|ADA3B718175C7D76F5E18B078E1C3240|Lots of attractions/001 thrill rides/001 movies characters and interesting show make it one of the best places to visit for young and old alike.
akshatpaul|New Delhi- India|18 March 2017|Must visit when you are in Singapore & from India|4|20F4D8662CD0529F663EC8F596644CD3|My title says it all - this is one of best amusement parks if you are coming from India there is nothing to match here. Keep one full day for Universal and buy express card to beat the line - lines are really long. And the best rides could take over 2hrs of standing if you dont have express tickets. With express it will take 30 mins too. Must visit rides are Transformer/001 Pyramid and Alien vs predator roller coaster. In food do try burgers at american diner they are amazing.
zangisaac|Ho Chi Minh City- Vietnam|18 March 2017|Must-see place when visiting Singapore|5|CFAEB297E42F143AD3BEC0E0E5C57E7F|Though the price is relatively high but the service is value for money. There are a lot entertainment reminding our passion for movies. There are parades around weekend for the children. However/001 you might suffer from long queues during national holidays or weekends.
michaelbP9066EQ|Perth- Australia|18 March 2017|Overrated|2|2DF29D2162992106732BF9CDC44BD99E|Very expensive destination...not impressed with any of the exhibits...bit of a rip off really. No comparison to Universal Studios in LA...no filming activities or film sets/001 very poor definition of Hollywood and very dated exhibits. Not representative of Universal Studios at all. Main activity is to rip money out of tourists...very successfully. Very poor sign posting to connect with cable car to/from Singapore/Santosa Island. Staff and guides not very helpful with directions.
Aakansha J|None|17 March 2017|This is a must to See......|5|0D19C30F0CACB9D2CA35F3DC2521CD26|This is great attraction for all ages.... Everyone will have lots of fun here. You won't have the time to get bored at all. There is an event going on everywhere you turn your head. You won't have to walk that far to get to the next event and there are many rides there as well. You should get the ticket for this online as it is easier and you get a discount as well. There are a lot of restaurants inside and outside food is not allowed but there is not much food options for vegetarians/ Indians. But we still got some veg Indian food from a cafe/ restaurant in the mummy world and you could get ice cream/001 brownies/001 fries and stuff to eat as well.It will take you a whole day to see it completely and still you will feel like you missed many things/001 so be on time to enter. Also do take the map at the entrance as it will provide you with all the details of the events and there time as well/001 plus a description of all the rides and events.
James M|None|17 March 2017|Universal studios |5|508E4ECFB5C433DEC3C73FD097927230|A wonderful world to explore. Universal studios is full of attractions that will blow ur mind. Makes sure you visit the place anytime you are in singapore.
alhasan1909|Lahore- Pakistan|17 March 2017|You Cannot Miss This|5|3A3ABB12433700AC6CFA706E75766590|Yes it's over priced the food is expensive there might even be long queues but if haven't been there you must visit at least once specially with children they will love it. The rides are fantastic the shows are amazing Specially the Rockafellas Street Boys in the New York section they put on an incredible show. My kids loved the Sesame Street show time will just fly by. Great Fun a bit expensive but you must experience it at least once if your visiting Singapore
borg69|Sydney|17 March 2017|Great day|4|678C3F3E9226F1F6C3B9D0F57A078FD9|Had a great day at Universal studios. Reasonably priced entry and food. One problem is waiting times for rides. You can purchase a fast pass but this an expensive option as they range from $50- $80 per person.
NhungNguyen811|Ho Chi Minh City- Vietnam|17 March 2017|Exciting place  but not for oldie|4|1308488770B581E1D5D81E5812081A92|I've been there twice. The first time was with my friend back to 2014. We went there on weekend and faced long queues for every ride. The second time was with my family last Oct. We was there on weekday/001 so the line is much shorter. The whole park was still great as usual. The best ride must be Transformer/001 we tried twice!!! The problem is that my parents were not really into these exciting rides. After two rides/001 they gave up and just walked around looking and eating instead. So/001 advice for those with oldie: - should not bring them there unless they are ready for thrilling games. - Food and drink could be expensive there/001 so it's better if you prepare some in advance. There're taps in every game/001 so just bring the empty bottle and you can take the water in the tap.- Be there on weekday to avoid the long queue- Bring hat and put on sunscreen to avoid the heat.
Clarinda L|None|17 March 2017|Felt Like A Child Again|4|D421008DBE4FB1D875180A8947F950B5|It was great to reminisce the fairy tales and action heroes from the movies.The rides and sights are the best!I enjoyed Spielberg's action hurricane experience.Sesame St characters were as cute as I remember/001 I just missed Big Bird!Marlyn Monroe was quite a stunner.I love USS!
ketkif|Mumbai (Bombay)- India|16 March 2017|A Must visit once you are at Singapore|4|6BA507E5A6B1AAAC9BEEC59459CCDF1D|A Must visit once you are at Singapore but also be prepared to take the attitude of some korean staff working at Universal Studios. Behavior of the staff is rude but the rides/001 games 3D and 4D shows are awesome.
Yebe|Jakarta- Indonesia|16 March 2017|So many great attraction|4|EFB1005CD17390DD9D8DE4450945BCC6|I visit Universal studio when Halloween event. It is so good and scary too (in good way). The queue was so long/001 it took about 1 hour for 1 attraction.
alsawo|Brooklyn- NY|16 March 2017|Small but worthwhile |5|846189A4CEFFC5304011411727D317AA|You don't need multiple days as this is a very small park. In one day we were able to do everything twice. It's great for young children or as a first theme park experience. For older kids wanting a lot of fast roller coasters/001 it might be disappointing. Our five year old could do almost everything. Our three year old could do enough. We visited midweek and there were very short lines/001 normally 5 or 10 minutes if we couldn't walk right on. The longest we waited was 30 minutes for Transformers. We considered the fast passes but I'm so glad we didn't pay the extra money. No need. Crowds were very manageable. Much of the park is covered so you aren't in the hot sun too much. I had never seen that at another theme park. It was great!Expect your typical overpriced theme park food and souvenirs. They say no outside food or drinks but this didn't seem to be enforced. If I had to do it again I might bring my own snacks.
ZzZ_Clye|None|15 March 2017|Well Planned Route Helped!|4|C68207EF57D21449599810C20C6114A0|Went there during CNY (I know!) I thought I was setting myself (and my husband) up for disaster but it turned out better than I expected! We did exactly what was recommended online. Go to the popular rides first/001 eat lunch early (at 12noon) and take note the show time so that we won't miss anything. We ended up riding all the popular rides more than once/001 some thrice! (No Express Pass required) We had lots of extra time taking pictures and even try some of the children rides (:D). However/001 I would like to add a few things. It is great to wear shorts with zippers so that you can keep some of your paper money with you when going for rides especially those don't allow you to bring anything with ya and asked you to lock it in the locker. The queue wasn't taking too long just we were lost track of the time and then we were stranded because we over the 40mins free period (we were there 42mins mark - serious!) and need to pay 2$ before can collect our stuff. Our wallets were inside the locker. Luckily I manage to borrow some from a kind couple that just walked in to put their stuff inside the locker. Or better still load your EzLink card with some money on it and just carry it around inside your zipper pocket :D No coins because the staffs will buzz you out from the queue. We brought our own raincoat/001 one that provides good protection but thin. Because what they sell inside the themepark really do nothing for you. We even get to enjoy the Water World Show right at the wet area without being (soaking) wet! Don't go for Cylon and Human first if you are there early in the morning right when the themepark open. Why? Because that early/001 they are not running at full capacity. So eventho the lines aren't long but it will take double the time to clear. That's what happened to us..so after the Human ride/001 we went to another one then came back for Cylon when it is running at full capacity. We had a great time!
elden e|None|15 March 2017|Best Day|5|9F4546FBA05665F873593266177829CF|Spent a day in universal studio.1st ride: Jurassic park (prepare to be wet! but there are dryer available outside to dry yourself.)2nd Ride: The Mummy (very thrilling! because its dark inside)3rd Ride: Transformer ( a 3D roller coaster ride. it was awesome but be prepare for a long queue)4th: Water World Show (Prepare to get wet!

veelala|None|15 March 2017|The most fun we had in Singapore!|5|00371E5BD8823CB324E196831999A063|I think Universal Studios was the part of our trip that all of us were looking forward to the most. We visited the park on October 10/001 2016.We booked our tickets online on the Sentosa site and received a discount + a free water bottle (with the head of the Indominus-Rex from Jurassic World). I would recommend the online reservation because you won't have to spend a ton buying water bottles within the park/001 and the refills are not as expensive as filling up once.We entered the park around at 10 am/001 and Beetlejuice was standing near the entrance. We went on the Jurassic Park River Rapids ride first/001 and then went on The Mummy. The later's queue was around 45 minutes the first time we rode it/001 but we didn't get bored. There is music and sound effects along the way/001 and plenty to look at.We had lunch at the Discovery Center in Jurassic Park - wet noodles with vegetables. Four of us shared three plates as the quantity is pretty big and it's a little expensive. So this is a good option for vegans. The ambiance in the place was of course great.I emailed the company before-hand about options and they also suggested the Oasis Space Cafe. Their Indian option with chana masala/001 rice and papadums is vegan. Being Indian/001 we didn't want to have Indian food even on vacation (: Via email/001 they also said they could customize a pizza without cheese or dairy products. So make sure to contact them in advance if you have any special dietary needs.After lunch/001 we made our way towards the junction where Jurassic Park/001 Water World and Far Far Away meet/001 and got to see the raptor show. Took a bunch of pictures and successfully answered that Bubbles was a velociraptor (yay dinosaur-loving me!) We rode The Mummy again around at 3 pm and the wait time was only 10 minutes (yay!) We also walked around and discovered other places like the Canopy Flyer. If you walk a little further inside/001 you will see nice picture areas with a T-Rex fossil head and broken dinosaur eggs that you can sit in.Unfortunately we couldn't meet any of the Sesame Street characters. When we got to the designated area/001 they were leaving to take a break/001 and when we came back they still hadn't returned.Before leaving/001 we rode Madagascar A Crate Adventure/001 King Julien's Beach Party-Go-Round/001 Spaghetti Space Chase/001 Accelerator/001 Lights/001 Camera/001 Action/001 and Shrek 4-D Adventure.Our favorites were definitely Jurassic Park Rapids/001 The Mummy and Canopy Flyer.The park is small and the day we went/001 the crowd wasn't too big. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Everyone who worked there was always smiling. Would definitely visit again/001 thanks for the memories and the experience Universal Studios!
kim1012|Singapore|15 March 2017|Brilliant|5|2E1D2C9761530A32CC23C51E3359F874|Universal studios has worked very hard to make the space not just an attraction/001 but also an experience. Having the fast pass really helped us to enjoy the experience better and without queues and my two daughters had a blast.
David L|Blue Mountains- Australia|15 March 2017|Universal Studios - Singapore is great|5|C44306A6758A3C62EFB7EA8A0EE49C88|My wife and I had a great day at Universal Studios/001 it is a bit out of the way and expensive to get to if you travel on the cable cars/001 there is also a long walk to get to it after the cable cars. It is not well sign posted and we had no idea how far it was from the transport. There is a lot on this Island and Universal appears tucked away in a corner. Once there it is a great place/001 first of all we received the Seniors Discount (it doesn't matter which country you are from - if you are over 60 you can get in at the Seniors Rate - just let them know when buying your ticket). The park was fantastic and well designed/001 we enjoyed the rides and things to see in all the lands. This is a fantastic day out.
cathylewis997|Wisbech- United Kingdom|14 March 2017|Good day |5|B86222D015B9C95DD920429226133F3A|Spent the day on sentosa island and visited universal studios/001 brillant day ques for rides werent too bad/001 we went on a monday as thought the weekend would be busy. Lovely place/001 enjoyed the waterworld show/001 sit at the back if you dont wana get wet.Food and drink a bit pricey but plenty of free water fountains about so just take a bottle and keep filling.The shrek 4D ride was really good and well worth a visit but was disapointed with the lights camera auction in the new Yorkshire zone.Good day for all the family well worth a visit
_applehoney1001|Singapore- Singapore|14 March 2017|BAD ATTITUDE|1|27CA743DF452F75AA5F7FCE76E859860|was with friends who had express tickets while i don't but we followed rules and queued but was met with a staff with very bad attitude at Cylon. Was accused by her and got pulled out of the ride. Decided to just give up on riding it.

Lokesh G|Singapore- Singapore|14 March 2017|Fantastic Adventure! Planning to go again!|5|2F896DC6870D9822BA76049F41572428|I visited Universal Studio along with my family and my friend's family. We both have young kids (5 year old and 1 year old). But/001 that did not limit us from having all the fun! There are loads of things to do at Universal Studios for everyone. My Son (5 year old) had lots of fun at the Puss in Boots/001 Far Far Away from Shrek series/001 Madagascar themed ride/001 Transformers/001 etc. We had a great time riding on Battle Star Galactica! It's a great experience. Don't miss that. If you can go there on a weekday around 11/001 you can pretty much cover everything without buying an add-on express ticket. But if you are not so lucky/001 then better to buy an express ticket! This allows you to skip the queue for lost of the rides! Don't miss the Ancient Egypt and the Lost World attractions. If you are not too fussy about drinking water/001 try to carry an empty bottle so you can fill it up at various water stations inside! Food is expensive inside the studio/001 but you can always have god at the Malaysian Food court just outside Universal Studio. If you are lucky and it doesn't rain/001 you will have lots of fun! We plan to go there again during my son's school holidays!
tanlydia608|Singapore- Singapore|14 March 2017|The Lights Camera Action|4|5CC83635417AD016862A4C1B871BF71F|Several activities/001 my favourite one was Lights/001Camera/001 Action- where they showcase movie tips and editing . Tips & Tricks you learn from a director perspective.
LucasBDS|Singapore- Singapore|14 March 2017|Wonderful rides!!|5|A4E079D5F25474AAE3FA6D2D88623A57|My family and I went to Universal studios and we had a whale of a time there. We rode rides like Shrek's 4D Ride and the best roller-coaster there was the Battlestar Galactica.
Rachel B|Mandaluyong- Philippines|14 March 2017|Thrilling!|5|8AC94C0942543F40160600A60594A839|A must-go to place if you're going to Sentosa Island. The rides always start you off with some kind of panic. IT tries to scare you and heighten your emotions/001 which really adds to the thrill! My favorite ride is the Transformer ride. It's really cool - a combination of virtual reality/001mini roller coaster and great storytelling. If you have no health problems/001 I suggest you try this out! :D It's worth spending a day in. If you're not that into rides/001 there are shows too and a lot of instagrammable views inside (all man-made).
Chix C|Manila- Philippines|13 March 2017|Worth the visit|4|B6477C1CF59FFA8619D62E844DE1830E|We went to USS last March 2/001 2017 as a couple we booked our ticket through the website which I believe they have a promo that time which is already good for 2 with free $30.00 worth of vouchers you can use for food and merchandise. Plus you can bring home a 6R sized photo for free! Such a good deal! We were not able to try all the rides due to limited time we reached the park before lunch and went out exactly at the park's closing time. It was a tiring but fun day! I'll definitely come back here to try the other rides that I was not able to try. The best ride I tried was Transformers and Battlestar Galactica-Human. Worth all the wait! And oh if you don't want to wait too long for Battlestar galactica ride one tip i can give is try riding it before the park close no lines and whatsoever! Haha!I'm just sad that I was not able to take photos with the characters especially Minions because they only come out for a couple of mins and they won't allow you to line up if its past the given time. Boo!!! Longer time pls. And oh fireworks! Make it everyday instead of just weekends and holidays pls! Went shopping at the USS store for souvenirs I got lucky somehow cause there are shirts that were on sale on the day we came so I was able to get shirts for the whole family! Yay! But its quite expensive there guys. So better have extra cash!
rinkuhgarg|New Delhi- India|13 March 2017|Wonderful theme park|5|808ED1DF47EA82CBF62C16C8B571D619|I visited universal studios in June 2015. This theme park is located on Sentosa Island. Shows n theatre artists are really wonderful. You can spend your full day in joyful mood.
Axis N|None|13 March 2017|the best amusement park i had in my life  yet!!|5|E9663AA5D6D0843AC03FC010D91F86FF|absolutely the best one so far i had! the rides/001 the design/001 the show.. especially the show! almost everything in this place is a top notch! the only minus point here is the staffs/001 i expect more from the staff attitude and awareness.. some of the were very nice and helpful but most of them feels like just standing there waiting they work-shift over without giving any feeling that makes us feels welcome... especially the performer/001 all of them! yea all of them were very very great at their job and their roles!it's as if i see a movie without TV watching all the performer here/001 and all of them were very nice and helpfulbut overall even with the "too normal" attitude from the staff/001 i'm still very satisfied with my visit here/001 and definitely come back again if i have the chance
Asaduzzaman R|None|12 March 2017|A day at Universal Studios|5|40AB14D1AB24AAABDD4DB60E3BD54757|It is must visit place at Singapore if u r traveling for adventure! U should be accompanied by friends or family coz u wont find it entertaining if u go alone. Take umbrella as it may rain anytime.
mitzie_09|Riyadh- Saudi Arabia|12 March 2017|ChubBiboy's Adventures|4|48D6966264BAB8883572713949EF62ED|We enjoyed a lot when we visited USS. We went there last November 2016 together with my cousin and 2 year old kid. I think one day was not enough to cover all the rides and attractions. The park was a bit busy when we visited that time. Long queues plus super hot weather but good thing there's big fans cooling the people on queues waiting for their turn to ride. Food stalls are found everywhere/001 you cannot go hungry with tons of them around you. If you're travelling with kids it's better to prepare strollers with you. But/001 if in case you weren't able to bring strollers; there are stroller rentals available near the park's entrance. You can visit USS webpage for updated pricing. Overall experience was nice/001 we'll definitely visit Universal Studios Singapore again.
Suz B|Kununurra- Western Australia- Australia|12 March 2017|Amazing time|5|8280A84921A7AE151F508444549F64AD|We had a amazing time here/001 got in all the rides. Totally recommend paying extra for the express passes/001 as we had no wait times for any rides.
Vikhil S|None|12 March 2017|Theme Park 🇸🇬 |5|4038A4723DCEA19F5731B248507B4C7E|Universal studios in singapore at sentosa island is an ultimate theme park with lot of adventures and activity . Park is been divided into different zone and its part of activity. They have d roller coaster with great speed and one of d best in d world . Eygpt section has a roller coaster which is indoor and in dark which is a much try experience. Park is provided with water facilities free everywhere for drinking and outside snacks is also allowed so it good for Indian people who are vegetarian/001 so dat they can carry it ....
azrin_zabri|Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia|12 March 2017|Bucketloads of fun|5|6C80350EF0A9CB1D0C3BB117E2A7FDFB|Came here to celebrate my son's 4th birthday. We had a great time. Despite him having a flu/001 he had plenty of fun in uss. My boy is a real animal cartoon fan/001 so the madagascar rides were his personal favourites. Luckily he's seen the shrek movie before we came here too. He loved the shrek dungeon cinema thingy too. Although the queue was long and the briefing took a while/001 it was all worth it. The water effects from the donkey sneeze & other scenes was a major talking point for him all the way back to the hotel. So we knew that the short movie screening was memorable and enjoyable for him. We/001 the parents could not go for the sci fi rollercoaster rides becoz it was just the 3 of us and my toddler was ineligible for then. One of us had to take care of the child/001 so it would be less enjoyable to experience it alone. The people we saw who took them seems to have had a really good time. Who knows/001 maybe we'll be back again when he's grown up to enjoy the rides we couldn't take this time around. Plenty of retail shops and eateries in here too. A great many options from the themed shops all the way to the main one at the entrance. Goods and merchandise cane with plenty of variety and it would be a challenge for anyone coming out of those shops empty handed what with the great many varieties you guys have on offer. Another thing to mention is the appearances by characters which are lively and well scheduled out thruout the day. We had bucketloads of fun with the penguins and other madagascar characters. Special mention to the big guy who hosted the madagascar dance thingy. He is lively & friendly. Thank you to the whole uss team/001 i feel that you guys set the benchmark for a well organised theme park within our region which other similar parks can try match or gauge their own standards.
Forever-Nanda|Mumbai (Bombay)- India|11 March 2017|Small  hectic & loved by kids!|5|11DFD0C60E71E6CB35DF390B6B120A53|Visited just before Xmas 2017/001 with family / kids. Many rides & attractions in a small place.If planned properly/001 it is possible to cover all rides with just the regular ticket. There is a path around the lake/001 for getting to the rides quickly/001 instead of going by the regular path. Keep walking around to see rides having minimum wait times & grab if reasonable. Ponchos may be needed/001 as it rains unexpectedly. Prepare to queue up for food in the eating joints.

It was two of us on a Friday and we did actually manage to try almost everything in one day!

Do get the map and program guide in the morning as the program time might be different. !!! If you decide to have lunch/001 you can skip Treasure Hunters and Dino-Soarin as they r very light rides.
Girija33|Pune- India|10 March 2017|Dreamland |5|9E88D700C0D057B631A85733235A38BD|Amazing rides. Here imagination comes to life. People of all age groups can be entertained here. It is a very fun filled experience.
TravellingLX|Blackpool|10 March 2017|Small but great park|4|ED77F33C4433E0D4504AA02CBA08DD52|If you are in Singapore then Universal is certainly worth a visit. I purchased a six month pass as I was working in the area for a while/001 so I visited a couple of times. The attraction is very well themed and usually the queue's are only small/001 it's probably not worth paying for fastrack during the weekdays. The best rides in my opinion are the Terminator-don't miss this out it really is fantastic. The Mummy Returns/001 again another good ride in the dark and finally Battlestar Galactica. Take suncream as it's easy to get burnt whilst walking around. Food options are good-I can recommend the Turkey Legs and also the pumpkin sandwich from the Jurassic Park area.
ashishrawat12|Singapore|10 March 2017|You will never get tired at Universal Studio|5|51B63B4CAA8775F4F7C4B8F109B5605F|Its a fun place to be with your family and kids. It offers attraction for all age group. Its little crowded during weekends and holidays but you can purchase priority pass for 30$ and beat the queue. If you don't want to buy the priority pass then try to reach early during opening time and take Jurassic Park boat ride first. Enjoyy
Nikhil G|None|10 March 2017|Must place to visit|5|1B83F3F638B2884188DEE31377B8759D|Enjoy your full day with kids and ensure kids should be above 195 cm so that they too enjoy all rides with you.Must place to visit

It shall be one of a wonderful experience in your life. But do not expect good food inside the Universal Studio. You have choices of delicious and varieties in the Resort World area/001 from food court to Michelin star restaurants.
Jagdish M|Mumbai (Bombay)- India|9 March 2017|AMAZING!!!!|5|BFBED8082551AA500F2AA05F4F109B26|I am a huge fan of amusement parks and have been here last year and it was absolute epic.The park is set in a relatively small area but has a lot rides.Quees can be long for some of the rides like battle star gallactica/001transformers ride/001etc...Definetly worth visiting if you are in singapore.
Sunshine O|Bandung- Indonesia|9 March 2017|the correct place for holiday with family|4|BE6B5234EE5E40689A11C24224CEC1CD|Universal studio is the best place to bring your family specially your child for spent holiday./001 the place is one complex with the sentosa island/001 there have some good spot for took picture also have many attraction and games that could be your choices/001 I think is not enough only one hour to tried all games that you want it. Is not only the games/001 you should be walked around this location to know and seeing all spots.
nbvillamor|Calamba- Philippines|9 March 2017|A FUN-FILLED VACATION|5|371575B7A7122AF0ACBC64E144A42B75|My husband and I together with my football players went for a two-week tournament and vacation last 2014. One of the places that we have enjoyed the most was the visit to the Universal Studios. Indeed/001 the place was very inviting. This amusement place made me bring myself to my childhood. The venue was not just for children to enjoy but also for the adults to make memories with family and friends.In reference to cleanliness and orderliness/001 its truly amazing that you can never see litter around. The staff/ employees were very accommodating and friendly. The service was excellent. I feel like going back again to Singapore and bring my kids with me to feel how lucky they are as children and how fortunate they are to enjoy life as it is.Universal Studios Singapore does not only offer quality services/001 they provide memories to cherish and pride to uphold.
Lollen94|None|9 March 2017|Jam Packed Day|4|B3A8F61EC76F8DD8C89CF07403677DB9|It was such a great day out and definitely worth the money if you have kids! So many things to see and so many photo opportunities. Would recommend the fast track passes/001 especially as some of the wait times are over an hour per ride. The rides are all great but part of me felt like there wasn't enough! Plenty of restaurants/cafes to eat at so you will never end up hungry! Souvenir stores were pricy for some items but that is to be expected anywhere you go! All up a great day out
Mikaela Elise G|Manila- Philippines|9 March 2017|One day wouldn't be enough|4|6B4B6094601A415A2BA185E60EA2B4E9|First of all the place is really beautiful. I like the buildings/001 the glass roof/001 the overall design of the place is really instagramable.This is for the kids and kids at heart.I recommend the Jurassic Rapids/001 Lights Camera Action by Steven Spielberg (my personal favorite) and the Shrek 4D.
earth05|Cavite City- Philippines|8 March 2017|Amazing day!|5|363F59FC49AC14489C875A55928EEA48|It was my second time at Universal Studios Singapore. The place hadn't changed much/001 but my experience was still so great and memorable. There were various activities available for any age group/001 but the Waterworld show is not to miss. My friends and I also enjoyed Transformers: The Ride. The street shows were also entertaining as you get to meet different characters from the different segments of the park. I specifically liked Charlie Chaplin just walking around New York along with the park guests. This place is definitely a must-visit when in Singapore. I'd still go back!
Gary H|Singapore- Singapore|8 March 2017|Close up with Elmo!|5|4AF61F4D9847CA3BC90701C5C4C99738|My kids are young at age 3 and 1. With kids this young/001 the double stroller really came in handy and fit them nicely. Love to see the older brother holding on to his kid brother and watching the sights around them.Signed up for a 6 month season pass as well which we thought was well worth it at 98 dollars each for adult given that my children have free admission.We went on a weekday and had the opportunity to try out 6-7 attractions. Definitely the experience on a weekday is much better with thinner crowds- you spend much less time queuing for food and rides.Highlight for my kids was the close up photo with Elmo and friends. They absolutely love it!
Eden C|Sydney- New South Wales- Australia|8 March 2017|The best day|5|49CCF6F4F4D76360E03ED58BB4DC97D2|My partner and I spent our first day here/001 an awesome experience that we will never forget. We were sceptical as we didn't have kids with us/001 however as two adults we had so much fun! The Mummy ride and Transformers were our favourites! An awesome day! The express pass is also worth the $30!
Bego75|Basel- Switzerland|8 March 2017|Disappointed |3|054CA85D5C59469773EB7F0B07820F1A|I must say I had high expectations for this amusement park and I was very disappointed. If you are going with smaller children perhaps it is more fun. But we were four adults (our children are 18 and 20). There are maybe 5 or 6 rides that were exciting/001 but the rest is quite lame. I also found the park to be very small. We have near my home (in Germany) an amusement park that is probably 3 to 4 times bigger/001 with 11 roller-coaster/001 plus several other attractions. Being this in Singapore and for that price I don't think it was worth the money. In our opinion the good rides were/001 gallactica/001 transformers the ride/001 the mummy/001 jurassic park rapids and the Shrek 4D movie is OK but we have seen better ones.
Kateryna M|None|8 March 2017|Attractions park|4|FEF48FC2FDEA632980F6B31C71362416|Same to Disneyland or many others/001 amusing and playing. Definitely worth visiting for the whole day. The best roller coaster is Cylon/001 Battlestar Galactica.
NauticalVoyager|Durban|8 March 2017|The baby of the franchise |4|FD8A71B0837BDA49C26F9B8E693ABB36|An easy outing for a day/001 but if you know the franchise be prepped for a smaller park and therefore often more crowded. Get there early and do Mummy and the dueling coasters first/001 then meander through the other major rides before tackling the smaller ones. The WaterWorld stunt show is great.
Baliadvtoday|Denpasar- Indonesia|8 March 2017|Singapore adventure trip|5|E85F3EDCB5B9C302853676D8F045731E|Nice place and comfortable....a lot of show in this place with unforgetable experience...good to play and traveling our kids in here they can study /001fun and playing .

itylernz|Auckland Region- New Zealand|7 March 2017|Fun day out!|5|CCB63D6CF87124F9F2C7B8AB96197C0D|After being to Universal LA/001 this isn't as good but was well worth the visit!The day we went there were not too many people. Best to go when it opens and go to the most popular rides first. You can buy an express pass that lets you go to the front of the queue on most rides once. We purchased this but didn't use it until later in the day when more people were at the park and the wait times were 45 minutes plus - wired a treat because you actually do skip the queue to the front. Food as expected was delicious but overpriced/001 drinks the same. We were going to get public transport there but found it easier to get a taxi. Going home we rode in the cable car over the water from Sentosa. Great day out for everyone!
TimandKath|Melbourne- Australia|7 March 2017|Great day out|4|BCE8A202A1B8C230DD3CF6E11394B3FC|Universal Studios is a great day out and brings out the inner kid in us all. The rides are good and there are a good amount of options for those who don't like things like roller coasters. The best ride was probably the Jurassic Park rapids ride/001 however you do get wet! We didn't mind at all as it was such a hot day that some splashes were nice/001 however sitting around in wet shoes all day is not nice. Make sure that you take shoes that it doesn't matter if they get wet as they will easily dry! We purchased the front of line pass - and although we didn't go on a number of rides (all the roller coasters) it was still worth the purchase. Some of the rides had wait times of 45-75 minutes/001 yet with the front of line pass you go right to the front and get through immediately. It is very hot at Universal Studios so try to choose a cooler day to go.
Terrence_Soong|Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia|6 March 2017|Transformers!!!|5|3782B7CFA14F8B6529E37CF9610D4C37|Went with 2 young kids.. plenty of rides. Food in there was expensive and of limited choices. Would recommend to get out of the Universal Studios for lunch and then come back in! Kids enjoyed the 4D Transformers ride!!! However/001 my sons were not too keen sit on the Battlestar Galactica ride. The rest of the rides were milder.
Billiam1982|Gosford- Australia|6 March 2017|Great fun|5|CA5F9E6551435717CE2DB0BFB108D7A2|Fun theme park on Sentosa Island. My wife and daughter loved it. Just wish the food and merchandise was cheaper.
Another_Planet_7|Perth- Australia|6 March 2017|Fun Day Out|4|8B612CEB05DC74BFE92C8C334921531F|Universal Studios Singapore is a great place to spend the day/001 whether young or old. Getting to the park is relatively easy/001 by taking either the Sentosa Express or cable cars to Sentosa/001 which are close to MRT network.If visiting as a couple with the other half not too interested in the 'big' rides/001 this saves you a lot of time/001 particularly as the 'big' rides (the rollercoasters/001 basically) allow single riders. This saves a lot of time/001 particularly as during peak times these rides have waiting times varying for between the 45 and 90 minutes. I would recommend going on the 'big' rides in the first hour or two of opening/001 as you will be disappointed otherwise. You can buy a pass which allows you express entry onto these rides/001 but this costs about $60 extra/001 so can result in an expensive day out.Even a few of the family friendly rides are worth a go/001 even if you don't have kids with you (Puss in Boots and Sesame Street). We queued over an hour for the Madagascar ride/001 and to be fair/001 this is pretty average and wouldn't recommend doing so.
DA Paloma P|Fuente de Piedra- Andalucia- Spain|4 March 2017|Mastercard Promotional is Love 😍|1|FC35A94F560C0A2337E77467E0CE90C7|Purchased ticket weeks before our trip and we discounted huge. Also/001 we love the freebies that came with it.We went on a weekend which explains the long queue but we got to see the parade which is a plus!Not advisable for hot summer days given Singapore's humid weather.The staff at the gate was rude. We went out to exchange our $$ at the money exchange right outside the gate and we were stamped with "invisible" mark for returning in.When we got back after exchanging currencies/001 she would not let us in. I do not know if that was trickery of some sort to have less people at the park. We asked her what was the "invisible" stamp for if she would not have a way to trace if we were really returning or just trying to sneak. I used to think of theme parks as happy places in Earth. Bad memory of a theme park which ruined how I view places as such.
Traveler-Saru|London- United Kingdom|4 March 2017|Fun day out|4|DD4900E7748255A9B7A9FF96EF8D2BD4|Its a good/001 full day out and it's pretty easy to get there. The rides and attractions are good fun. There's obviously lot of queues and waiting around/001 we had the express passes and still waited around and i would recommend people get this if they want a chance to experience all the rides.The lots of good food around/001 dozens and dozens of restaurants.
Kendell M|Weston- United States|4 March 2017|Loved it!!!|5|AF05D6716CCBAF895EFA0418640070AB|It's smaller than the Hollywood Studios in Orlando/001 Florida/001 but it was a great experience. The park is VERY clean. Go during the weekday to avoid long lines and take an umbrella. You never know when it's going to rain in Singapore. Everybody is super friendly and you won't be disappointed. We enjoyed the TRANSFORMERS ride. We enjoyed ourselves!
Pawanthakur|New Delhi- Delhi- India|4 March 2017|Simply Awesome|5|0362F3D42DFDF256B6DEA9615FA3CF23|Its was one of best experience and fun to take all the rides at universal studio. we thoroughly enjoy our time will sure come back again
JWC8899|None|4 March 2017|Love it|5|DCAE6B7426803F7ADC8B27E64B788BFA|We love this place and signed up for the annual pass. Love the easy going environment and friendly staff. Merchandise selling are cute and with reasonable price.
markwiles|UK|4 March 2017|Must go for young families|5|FF869FFA768697EA2A3F3BDC6B3DD98B|I always ensure that my children has something to do when we go on holiday. My 4 year old enjoyed herself at this place.I do not feel an express pass is necessary but I appreciate that it can save you a lot of hassle esp for families with lots of young kids.Park well run and queues moved swiftly. Fans were plenty along queue lines. Opportunities for snacks and water were plenty. Rides were good even for scaredy cats like me. If one was looking for wilder/higher rides/001 this park may not be it.Please ensure that sun protection advice are followed as it can get very hot esp between 10am til 5pm. Wear hats and spf creams and drink plenty of water. Try walking in the shade if you can. Queue lines will be shaded but not much shaded walkways when walking around park.
Filip_Paseka|Ho Chi Minh City- Vietnam|4 March 2017|Good park|4|271B0DC7E0CE54E05F86E603E1CFEB00|We spent in the studio whole day and tried almost every single attraction/001 staff was very friendly and smiling whole day.We would recommend to not miss Mummy area/001 of course sci-fi attractions and despite the fact we are not fans of transformers/001 3D drive there was simply the best.Unfortunately (big BUT)/001 you can buy express pass which allows you to go to the special queue and you skip the line. At some attractions there were so many people with this pass that even they made queue and waiting time for normal people was incredibly long. We absolutely not agree with this mechanism and in our opinion it is not way which park should go. It is only making people mad and angry.Another point is that in Jurassic park you need to pay for locker (longer you use it/001 more money you pay)/001 and together with many people with express pass you are just paying more for locker because they are skipping the queue (you wait more/001 pay more).If you would like to eat something/001 we definitely recommend Mel's bistro - great atmosphere with nice double burger.
ni2sh|Raipur|3 March 2017|Incredible Experience!!|5|05F6BF5A3DFD44457F79F89DC98EEE3A|Universal Studio Singapore is a fun place to be/001 it has everything for everyone whether you are a kid or an adult you will enjoy the most of the park. Very thoughtfully designed theme park with well managed facilities. It was our lucky day that the weather was clear and each and every ride was operational/001 though we waited long in the ques it took almost 2 hours in few rides. But the rides in the park are exciting/001 Mummy Ride and Galactic are the best rides. I personally liked the Transformers Ride and the Shrek Show. Lots of food options/001 but little expensive/001 you can also carry your meal box. There are few shops just to take some memorable gifts and many attractive places to take superb pictures. A must visit place in Singapore.
Ricardo S|None|3 March 2017|First time there and what is increidble|4|7F1903D845489796E14C8A69958617DF|Was a fantastic experience I could visit the complete park in one day. I think that some people is there on weekends and the food is so expensive
TrevHoltham|Mount Gambier- Australia|3 March 2017|Another day out|4|7F20E48DB2D47E620A76458FE2B86A76|We have now been to 3 universals and have read varying reports about Singapore ... We found it easy to get around ... Amazingly clean ... Understandable the accents don't fit the American origins but we enjoyed it
EtaTandela|Jakarta- Indonesia|3 March 2017|Children must go attractions|4|826E01080DD9D4A098F7BB2FFC007BFF|Suitable for young and older children. The playground not as big as Disneyland. A good place to drain your children's energy :DLook for their schedule for show and parade. Can take pictures with Universal's characters.
SBPerth|Perth- Australia|3 March 2017|Highlight of our Singapore Trip|5|98A603A5B53F6FE355A7D3016FEB1887|Plan to be there for the whole day. Multiple themed areas with rides for big and smaller kids. If you are a tourist only there for the single day the express pass would probably get you around quicker as some of the attractions can have 1-2 hour waits to get on.For myself the Transformers ride was the highlight/001 kids loved the junior rollercoster and the Madagascar boat rides.There are a variety of food offerings in the park/001 bit overpriced and from our experience not great.Some of the cloth shopping we saw (e.g. Universal shirts) were cheaper than you would expect.
Pam G|Melbourne- Australia|2 March 2017|Good|4|443662914BD0E26107774DB12FD5E2D1|Spent a lovely day with family & friends. However/001 I much prefer EuroDisney. The rides were ok. The lines were not too long. But it's much smaller than I expected. Food & drinks too expensive. We took a pass & went to have lunch outside the studio. Thank God they allow that.
Alexandra J|Melbourne- Australia|2 March 2017|Express pass is a must|3|F5BC361C1E7D05883D6B987025FBE958|I've been to a few Universal's now and this is probably the worst one. It was still a pretty fun day out but it lacked a bit of character. We bought the express pass which works on majority of the rides at the park and I have to say it paid for itself 5 times over. We skipped numerous ques which had waiting times of over 90 minutes... our longest wait was about 5. It was a lifesaver in the heat as well as a lot of the line areas aren't air conditioned and it was extremely hot. The food was extremely overpriced/001 which you expect so it's fine/001 but it was also really terrible... I don't know if we just chose the wrong places to eat but we didn't like anything. Getting there is super easy/001 it's just a tram ride over and you can buy you ticket to the park when you buy for the tram so you don't have to wait in line twice. I would still recommend going/001 but I won't be going back.
NinaDipak|Perth- Australia|2 March 2017|Exciting and Thrilling|5|D7D89FC3842C72057A59673D71496758|This is our second time to visit Universal Studios. It is advisable to pay slightly extra to be on the fast track lane. The queue is quite long. Make sure to go on the transformers and mummy rides.
Tarun S|Noida|1 March 2017|A day full of fun and adventure! |5|9343044A9F86AB7628D2BCF94CDBD468|This is definitely top Must Visit places in Singapore. Transformers the Ride/001 Waterworld Show/001 Lights Camera Action and Madagascar Boogie were great experiences and should not be missed. We visited in mid December so we were able to witness and enjoy all the additional fun n festive spirit filled shows that run around the Christmas time.
Влад М|None|1 March 2017|Incredible atmospher|5|0F6A1DD607F120A1525FDE36B35B1D19|I was here with my friends. I have never ride the roller coaster before that day! In the beginning I was afraid/001 but after the first ride i stopped:) Universal studio has 2 scary roller coaster. Rest attractions has scenarioб more interesting and with special effects.Many attractions for children of course. And i am not advise go to "Shrek" or "Madagascar" if you are adult."Transformers" is great!I didn´t like food here/001 but maybe because i am from Russia) I advise buy the EXPRESS TICKET!!!
amirfakhry|Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia|1 March 2017|It was perfect|5|2BC2B3AB6131FF2A6FFBA545DA41BE23|I came to the park as early as 9.30 and saw nobody was queuing up. Its strange compared to Japan where people get there 2 hours earlier. Soon as the park open I rushed to the Transformer ride in Sci-Fi. No queue at all. I think you don't have to go to Transformers as the queue are not that long in the afternoon. You should rush to cyclone. I rode it twice. It was the best rollercoaster I ever had. Finish the attractions at Sci-Fi and Egypt. Lost world opens at 11. You should be able to finish all the attractions before 11am and go to the Lost Park. Overall its fantastic. You don't have to buy express pass if you go early like me.
robert m|None|1 March 2017|FAMILY FUN DAY|5|D1FB8DE41B1BE22DD7986334CFEA7905|we were there the week after Chinese new year . ques for major rides only 5 to 10 mins maximum .Animated characters very friendly and helpful with photo opportunities.enough for 5 year old to enjoy /001and enough for adult /001Terminator ride is well done

Helen L|None|1 March 2017|Fun-filled USS Day in Surprising Singapore|5|EDAAC4D30CF6786233F67A5AE60470E5|I have been to Universal Studio Singapore numerous times (having owned their annual pass and season pass before)/001 but I never tire of it.If one enjoys adrenalin inducing roller coaster rides/001 then Battlestar Galactica is a must. The Cylon (inverted / suspended blue track) is more exciting as it ends with a 360 degree loop and has a spiral. The first time I sat on it/001 I was thrilled to look upwards to clear blue sky/001 whilst experiencing G force. But this time/001 the wait was 50 mins so we checked out the traditional Human (red track) instead. Surprisingly/001 the wait was only 5 mins/001 after an afternoon rain. In the morning/001 it was a 55 min wait. So we happily sat on Human twice. Although 'tamer'/001 Human is nevertheless still exhilarating.We also recommend Revenge of the Mummy which we also went on twice (5 min wait only)/001 and simply could not get enough of this wild ride in the dark.Canopy Flyer was great too/001 with a 15 min wait only.My overseas guest was thoroughly impressed with Transfomers which is great for all ages/001 and not to be missed (well worth the 40 min wait). It was down in the morning/001 but thankfully was fixed in the afternoon.Lights/001 Camera/001 Action is always exciting to watch/001 for the incredible special effects of a Category 5 hurricane about to hit New York.I also never tire of watching Shrek 4-D Adventure.The new Sesame Street show "When I Grow Up" at Pantages Hollywood Theater is really for toddlers and young kids only. Many adults left half way.Due to inclement weather/001 Water World (I always enjoy watching the stunt folks at work) was cancelled.This place is highly recommended for both overseas visitors and locals alike.Families/001 friends and couples will certainly enjoy a great day.The fun atmosphere and enjoyable theme park ambience provides a lovely respite from our stressful lifestyle.TIPS: You can now avail of their lockers for free (upto 45 mins)/001 so glasses/001 handphones and bags can be safely stored before your rides.They have water coolers outside their restrooms. You may even bring an empty bottle to refill water.Try to eat before or after the peak lunch time period.Their burgers and pizza make an affordable and quick tasty re-fueling for the day.Or you can get your re-entry stamp on your hand/001 and eat outside (at Resort World Sentosa with more F&B options) instead.First thing when you enter/001 dash off to the more popular rides such as Battlestar Galactica and Transformer first. We note that the queing time tends to get longer/001 as the day progresses.Bring your umbrella or raincoat as it can rain any time.You really need 1 full day to enjoy this theme park completely.When buying tickets on-line or at their counters/001 check if they have any promotional entry price or special package. There is usually some credit card promotion going on.
coolcatMerseyside|merseyside|28 February 2017|Lots of Fun.|5|776E400D199D78788AC6114E829E8C7B|Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Universal Studios/001 Singapore. Although it was a weekend visit/001 the place was far from crowded/001 though it's probably still best to buy the express ride tickets. Plenty of great rides/001 shows & attractions for all the family. We spent six hours there and the time simply zoomed by. A genuinely fun place to visit.
samperth2016|Perth- Australia|28 February 2017|Great place for everyone|5|B0667877CFC5509AEB6E00A72FA21986|We spend only one day and couldn't finish everything as there is long queues for every ride. But enjoyed a lot . Definitely go again. It is advisable to plan two day visit here if you are traveling with kids as there are plenty of fun.
Plans P|None|28 February 2017|Fun!|5|D192DA4E655CB2E031914AE563C2D924|It's what you would expect on a theme park. Do note that it is smaller than most though/001 considering where it's located. Must rides: Mummy/001 Transformers/001 Galactica. Also watch the street shows esp the one in NY area of the park. Bring water and a change of clothes. Food inside is expectedly expensive.
trangnguyenbnc|Ho Chi Minh City- Vietnam|28 February 2017|Best rides in Singapore|5|CBDF0840AC099F7999A7A461EC09A82E|Spent around 4 hours in this Studios. We had ridden plenty of rides with lots of fun. The MUMMY ride was the most exciting one. Our day was FUN!
Yulia V|None|27 February 2017|back to childhood|4|B7278B7BB5BF6B8D924B0FD69177981A|nice attractions park/001 ideal for a family visit with kids. A bit oldish/001 but charming. Very nice stuff. Better choose the ticket that lets you avoid the queues.
Piyush K|Ahmedabad- India|26 February 2017|Fun filled day full of excitement|5|CC7DE9E81C0F853E1D3FBBC9D74832FB|I was very excited to go to Universal Studios for the 1st time and was in no way disappointed. From the thrilling roller coasters to pump up the adrenaline to the cute rides in the Madagascar section/001 it was a perfect day of fun. This place is a must visit for all kinds of people from kids to grown ups/001 for adventure seekers to people looking for a fun filled day with family. Many options to eat and drink within Universal Studios. Make sure you carry a good camera to capture wonderful pictures with statues.
Darren G|Melbourne- Australia|26 February 2017|It's not that big|4|2493890EF2F42980AB9518F376852269|It was ok /001 very small/001 loved the Mummy ride and Transformers ride both the roller coasters that day had 1 1/2 wait so we decided not to go the Jurassic park ride another 1 wait.. it rained that day so no parade or 4 pm water show .. over all it's the smallest one I've been too.. it's not the best park but good for kids I guess .. mixed emotions on this one
Flying152|None|26 February 2017|Great birthday treat|5|EBBA3AEA95CA06BA4F61AD3A54BB62C6|Loved our recent trip to USS. Came with family and friends to celebrate my 40th. Went on a Monday to avoid the weekend crowds. Was still busy/001 about 25-40 min wait for rides but got on some rides after no wait at all. Did not buy the express ticket and still went on every ride except Battlestar. Loved Transformers/001 Lost Rapids (Jurassic Park)/001 Mummy and the Waterworld show. Tip: go on the rides when the Waterworld show is on/001 went on Lost Rapids twice with no wait. Not as big as Disneyland but still a great park.
Paula C|Bangkok- Thailand|26 February 2017|Best Ever|5|614606DAF1E0ECE546D3E16FC9AFA40D|It's was an amazing day for me in Singapore. The best and recommend things to do in there. Ticket seem not to be value for me as am not addicted of the plays/001 however/001 it's a lot of activities and fun there to discover. I recommend going with a friend or a group of friends as you can enjoy all activities together. The park is quiet big but it's very clean and convenience with the place to eat or sit. It's everyday clouded here/001 so advance ticket purchase online is the best way to skip the long line at the park entrance.Best Ever/001 especially The Transformer.
Sachit1985|Chandigarh- India|26 February 2017|A must visit in Singapore|5|7A01487F600A1AB50D511D6282A0745E|A fun filled place which is suitable for all age groups. Be it rides/001 shoes .. everything is perfect. Singapore trip is not complete without this place
Schmerko|Iowa|26 February 2017|Quality Universal Experience|4|FC1F4A876E7B0CBD168CE3AE0A8C58C0|The Universal Studio's theme park in Singapore is a quality theme park with a mix of favorite attractions from the U.S. parks and new attractions for Singapore. The park is small so you transit from neighborhood to neighborhood fairly quickly. The backdrops/001 sets/001 and street dressing are done well (but due to the smaller size can look a bit odd when you can see the next neighborhood right in the background of the current one).We went on a weekday (hours 10 am to 6 pm I believe). The entry process was fairly smooth and there wasn't much of a rush at 10:15 when we go to the gate. There are many options for purchasing tickets (try to do it on-line and print before you go if for no other reason to just make the process smoother). We had to find a kiosk selling tickets at the park and the signage was less than helpful (it was unclear where they were selling which tickets). Inside the park it was pretty easy (and almost no wait) to get on the rides or attractions for the first few hours. After 1 pm things started to get crowded. I can only image what a weekend may look like (especially Saturday which is the only day they have the character parade and evening fireworks). Food options in the park are pretty standard (fancy themed names for things/001 pretty bland/001 average food at pretty special or high prices).The different show timings were not well advertised (only at the spot of the show itself) and in their program it was unclear which shows would be street performances and which were inside proper facilities. The park also lacks a few rest areas (benches/001 cooling stations/001 etc.) that would make the experience more pleasant.Overall a pretty good experience and we had fun until our little one decided with the heat and jet lag they she had had enough and it was time to go home.

Definitely for kids of the past/001 present and future.
MichaelBrianT|Mandaue- Philippines|25 February 2017|Universal Studios Sentosa  a great theme park|5|E6545D121BA7016899A3953BCAB180F2|One of the better things to do in Sentosa. I'm a fan of theme parks/001 and although USS is one of the smaller amusement parks I've been to/001 there's something here for everyone. Lots of great rides and attractions. Food isn't spectacular though/001 and it's kind of expensive. Best rides are still Transformers and Battlestar Galactica. Waterworld is also a great show to catch! The parade was just good though. It's definitely good for day usage. I would recommend the fast pass if you can afford it/001 as you will cut down on the longer lines/001 but if you can wait 30-45 minutes for the bigger rides/001 it'll be fine. Great stuff!
Adrian D|None|25 February 2017|A great day out!|5|B927FB73CD547966FEDB847DB269A335|We absolutely loved Universal Studios. The rides were so much fun and there was plenty to choose from for both children and adults.We bought the express pass which was well worth the $50 extra. It meant on rides that had a 20-40 minute wait time/001 you go straight to the front and don't have to wait at all! Well worth it/001 it meant we went on rides that we liked/001 multiple times.
Am P|None|25 February 2017|A Day's Visit.|3|674BE9B05B1AEFA8E4B5F5189EAC2427|Went here for a day out.It is a small amusement park with a variety of themed sections and rides that cater for different age groups.We went around mid October 2016 on a weekday and it wasn't as busy as we were expecting.The rides were calmly subtle to screamingly wild. Some were 5 minute queues and some were more than an hour long.Everything that is sold within the vicinity is quite pricey typical of Universal Studios.They have water fountains in various areas usually near the toilet where you can grab a drink or refill your bottle. Also/001 there is a hawker area just outside the park which is considerably more affordable with a selection of options for a nice meal.
WhiteDragon2000|Shanghai- China|24 February 2017|Good Fun|4|1940BFCB92D57FA5A0ECCF351A760C43|This park has something for everyone. We prefer the "easier" rides like Shrek 4D... this ride really was great fun. We tried a few of the more adventurous rides... I am sure to the more octane craved types they would also be great! Overall a great day out!
A TripAdvisor Member|None|24 February 2017|Best theme Park I have ever been to!|4|None|All I can say is it was amazing. Went on as much rides as we could and the roller coasters that's a definite go area unless if you are susceptible to a heart attack then I would really really not recommend it/001 it nearly gave me one. The food was really expensive though so that was a downer/001 but other than that it was an amazing park. Definitely must visit if you in Singapore.
GrubbyNoodle|Canberra- Australia|24 February 2017|Great day but expect to wait for popular rides|4|F0B22563783DFBBACAE7A8E22F1F58E4|Went on Friday - try and avoid weekend. Opens at 10:00. Excellent mix of rides and shows for little ones to the big kids! We waited 60 minutes in line for the raft ride/001 and some were up to 90 minutes long so keep water with you! Good thing is that most waiting areas are undercover. If you don't mind splitting your group up/001 opt for the 'single rider' lane/001 much faster. Transformers ride was excellent!! Good food options and not too expensive as they tend to be in theme parks/001 happy hour drinks at KTs at 4:00 - Fantastic Mojitos!! Note that many rides do not allow bags/hats/sun glasses and you will need to hire a locker for $4/hour - if your wait time goes over the hour you have to pay again to have it unlocked. Tip - if you want to have the sky gondola ride back to Vivo city at end of day/001 buy the combined pass with Universal ticket and save $25 per adult.
MattCuthill|Christchurch- New Zealand|24 February 2017|Beware|1|1C27F7656012D911F4D350C34D67784B|Entered the Battlestar Galactica roller-coaster ride. The sign said 5 minute queue. We waited in a tiny queue for 90 minutes for a 30 second ride. It was hot/001 there were no fans going although they were there and there was no air conditioning. Only about 4 people every 10 minutes were allowed on the ride. When I finally got to the top I found out that there was a small number of teens going around and around in the express lane and they were blocking the ride for everyone else. DO NOT VISIT THIS PARK UNLESS YOU BUY AN EXPRESS PASS WHICH MAKES IT VERY POOR VALUE FOR MONEY. Very poorly run park
aakashsgoyal|Mumbai (Bombay)- India|23 February 2017|Must visit for Universal movie fans|5|7B29CC1FD7CE1F66C47B1D694C55BE76|Theme park with rides based on amazing movies like The Mummy/001 Transformers(best one!)/001 Jurassic Park and more. Must visit and a really good place to spend the day.

Pink P|None|23 February 2017|Wonderful day out! Unlimited express pass highly recommended |5|7B580C37922B314610EE5EA62ECBD2AF|Had a fantastic day out at USS! Went on a Thursday and the crowd is not as crazy as on weekends. So much fun/001 I signed up for season pass :).. Here are my tips on how to enjoy the park:- buying an unlimited express pass is totally worth it! No need to q and u can sit as many times u want on a ride.- Bring your own poncho/raincoat for the Jurassic park water rides/001 buying one inside USS cost $4 each- Be sure to plan to watch the shows/001 such as water world and Sesame Street/001 timings are printed on the brochure- Food is average and quite expensive/001 u could go to the Malaysia food street located beside USS entry for lunch/dinner instead- Bring a water bottle/001 there are water coolers scattered all over the park/001 1 bottle of water cost like $4-5/001 do keep hydrated cuz it's super hot and humid in tropical Singapore- Beware of crowds of tourist from China trying to cut the queues and pushing their way to the front. :(
Katkam978|Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia|23 February 2017|Poor customer service from staff|3|7C3466A20E8F9EBC3A7A18280F02469A|I have been to the US in Orlando & LA but the one in SIN is the worst because of the staff attitude. Most of the staff have a scowl on their face and not happy to answer any queries. The staff at the carts & the ones attending the rides are just there physically and have this uninterested blank look so please don't ask them anything as they answer you in a patronising manner. Management has done a poor job in training and uplifting the morale of the staff. However thumbs up to Mel's café staff /001 they are the best/001 so cheerful !

Brooke C|Cairns- Queensland- Australia|23 February 2017|fun day out|4|0721ECC7701F14C62895DD7E34498375|We had such a fun day out! Lonnnnng lines to the rides/001 but that's in every theme park in existence anywhere. Rides were good/001 safe and fun.

There was plenty to see for the day/001 enough coasters to keep them happy/001 and enough less stressful stuff to keep their mum happy as well.

16tarar|None|22 February 2017|Loved !! |5|80A87BD10285B2F20003139D469679C1|Universal is an experience and more for all ages. Kid friendly rides plus exhilarating adult rides. Transformers is a must ride/001 crazy good! Just don't eat at the Jurassic park food court/001 food was disgusting beyond disgusting. Go to any food court there other than this one. Also don't ride the Jurassic park ride until last/001 you get absolutely soaked and if you have shoes and socks on it's not a good time lol. Otherwise park is amazing/001 will definitely going back with my little family :)
Angele W|None|22 February 2017|Enjoyable|4|E0B5E58004A788BC1675875CD375C1E4|Spent the day in universal studios with a friend/001 the park was busy and hot but still enjoyed the rides. The park has everything between calm and thrilling rides. Some of the rides could have been longer but I say that about every theme park! It's worth getting the express tickets to skip some lines/001 especially when it's busy. I probably won't go again but it was fun for the time I was there.
Rachel B|Perth- Australia|22 February 2017|Good family day out|4|5EE1E15B8F304313D7451933011C1AAD|Transformers ride is the best ride in the park. Universal Studios is on Sentosa/001the park can be easily done in half a day and then there are other attractions and restaurants on Sentosa. The park is definitely more suited to families and younger children
Alessa_Josue|Singapore- Singapore|22 February 2017|Halloween Horror Night 2016 in USS|5|668DE1D3C7567788BD0893B7A211C241|If you're in Singapore/001 you just have to include this in your itinerary! Since I am living in Singapore/001 I have been to USS several times. This review would be the latest Halloween Horror Night theme. It was a great experience and the crowd is just huge! You have to purchase the express pass and believe me it is worth every penny. You don't want to be queuing all night long. The horror houses are fun and exciting! You have to come with your friends or family. But please do not bring little kids along during the Halloween horror night because it is mainly themed for adults. But if you are going there on a regular day/001 I bet everyone of all ages will just love the experience!
