Satira K,None,12-Aug-17,Horrible Horrible Queues,4,EFDD90190BA6461617A226C3C95426F6,We went there last week on a weekdays and it's not even school holidays/peak season but they are thousands of peoples. Bought online tickets from Expedia for $54 each of us. Arrived there at 11am (they open at 10am). Our first ride is Transformers since everyone kept saying its super cool and its a must. Que for almost 2 hours(almost give up)/001 but the ride is super awesome(6d). And the next one we goes to Battlestar Galactica roller coaster(there is 2 types) which took us around 1 hour of queuing(thrilling and must try but not for a fain-hearted people). Expected queuing time for all the rides inside USS 1-2 hours(depend on rides). Make sure your bring water bottle. They provide free lockers but only for first 2 hours(because some of the rides requires you to keep all your stuff inside the locker). Everywhere full of peoples. Food inside is very expensive. Make sure wear comfortable shoes like sport shoes do not wear heels. You can re-enter back in to the amusement park just make sure the staff stamp your right hand if you wish to re-enter.(at the exit).
38hamishm,None,12-Aug-17,Universal studios Sentosa.... Welcome to Hell!,1,59B9A7FA8D5AF24AAF026AD811259CAC,Love standing in queues for hours and paying huge amounts for the privilege? Then Universal Studios/001 Sentosa Island is the place for you! There are so many terrible things about this place it is hard to know where to start. Perhaps the whole concept - where they build attractions (rides) that must be stopped when there is bad weather and the risk of thunder and lightening... maybe someone should have factored in the weather stats in Singapore - with almost 200 days of rain annually - this means that the chances of being stuck in queue hell for hours are very high as they stop all operations waiting for the weather to clear. We experienced this twice -waiting for a total of almost 4 hours in long queues and weather stops for the pleasure of one 30 second ride which was over almost before it had begun. Perhaps a Dome over the whole complex may have been a smart idea - as the way it is now - you are at the mercy of the Singapore's fickle weather. That would be my next complaint - the length of the rides... after queuing for up for most of your day - the rides you wait so expectantly for are more often than not a terrible anticlimax and because the park is so small they are very short in length. Another delightful element is the whole concept of the express ticket - this is really fantastic as you wait often for hours in queues with almost imperceptible movement and you have the added pleasure of watching streams of smug express ticket holders casually strolling past you in another line. This does wonders for the moral of all the regular plebs who have paid an already size-able chunk of their pay packet to be there. This system is incredibly annoying and just adds a type of aggressive energy to the masses. Just charge one price and put a gate limit on how many visitors who can enter the park in one day/001 Is it really fair to expect people to wait for 160 minutes for one ride? Anything positive? Yep - some of the design within the park is nice to look at but this place is seriously overcrowded and it was such an annoying and frustrating experience that I would literally pay to avoid it. Punters beware!!!
Trang D,None,11-Aug-17,Amazing place,5,77C96BFC40419800F82B7F182FA54C39,Great feelings with lot of amazing rides.Great lively show made us feel real with the actors and actressHighly recommend activities to anyone go to Singapore besides shopping
Asif I,None,11-Aug-17,Get the Express ticket!!!!,4,C34E8657C38B12E7D8EFAFE0423ACFC1,Very long queues for all rides. Transformer ride the queue was nearly 2hours long. It was a very good ride but not sure if the two hours was worth it!So much to do and see but the queues made it impossible and exhausting. Food and drinks were expensive! We hired out a wheelchair as the kids got tired and found it difficult to walk.
summershineR,Manila- Philippines,11-Aug-17,March is a not so busy month,5,1D08AEC256AC4561DDB5177DA7C9AC78,Going to universal studios is worth every penny !!! We love the food hour it was hot but it was awesome and the rides as well
roryjdoyle,Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia,11-Aug-17,Terrible Queues,2,53914737C20758B841D5356ED067D5B1,Terrible queues from the minute you arrive to collect or pay for your tickets until you leave! You can buy an express pass to cut queues but that will cost an additional $100 per person. Rip off.
Febiehung,Sydney- Australia,11-Aug-17,Compact for young kids,4,E6912B14388BE7923F67DF5E4AC3929E,Great place for young kids but it was a bit too hot when queuing outdoor under the sun... There can be more air-conditioned waiting queue.
alancsimy,Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia,11-Aug-17,Family visit,5,967D16A3CADED7C6C290C15FF4A5C084,Huge park. price is expensive. long queue n take an hour n more to get in/on one attraction to another i.e. roller coaster/001 3D ride boat transformer etc. etc. Make sure you're really brave n dare to go on roller coaster.... open your both eyes n feel your heart beat. ... ooooowwwww.... hahahaahaa
Paulina922,None,10-Aug-17,Amazing place!,5,27F7FC8308B3B2A0E09847EDC80B6913,This UNIVERSAL is of course much smaller from Muami`s/001 but it really worth to visit it. Nice scenery and games. It worths to buy EXPRESS TICKET/001 I think its 70S$ more but the lines are too big to wait... Except from that the island has so many other things to do (like aquarium) that it really worth to visit it!P.S. Don't forget to visit Transformers and Mummy's roller coaster!
MN8888,Liverpool- United Kingdom,10-Aug-17,Expensive and very crowded,2,AD233A522C4B687BE64FF1C8238AE1F2,We went as a family in August and it was very crowded. The security and ticket queue took an hour when we arrived at 10.30We bought the unlimited express at an extra 100 per person and this proved to be worth it as it would cut the queues by half for all rides.We managed to do over 12 rides spending about 7 hours there And thr kids did enjoy the rides The worst bit was lunchtime where the lunch prak time was so crowded and queues again took over an hour again to get any foodCrowd control could be better managed and the park is a lot smaller than Disneyland parks
teodorspanu,Ploiesti- Romania,10-Aug-17,A way to spend couple of hours,3,D2F49137EDD85C7AF6DA3C57D6173AC2,A quite overated place. Few really interesting attraction and very crowded. Long queues after 12.00. At least 1/0015-2 hrs to stay in line. Too expensive for what you get!
Jonnytwosocks,Dubai- United Arab Emirates,10-Aug-17,Good day but not the best,3,0DB2C3614504C7262B1F5517017A1EC6,We visited the theme park and booked online suffice to say we still stood 55 mins to collect tkts/001 then when we asked how much express lane tkts are he tried to rip us off. Be careful here! The park is really limited and mostly for children... 10-15. There are very few big rides/001 but four are worth while. Its small/001 expensive/001 and very limited. We were done in less than 4 hours for 300 Brit pounds! Your decision guys?
callumm644,None,10-Aug-17,Well presented  terribly executed.,1,F407B00B85D3DBB55E2D4C7C1B5209BC,The Good the bad and the ugly:Good:I was impressed with the cleanliness and presentation of the park. The layout was easy to navigate and the rides catered to a range of age groups. The rides were pretty good/001 and the transformers ride was state of the art.The bad:Extremely busy. I've been to six theme parks now and this was the busiest I've ever been to. It was a Monday/001 granted it was school holidays/001 but it was just insane/001 to the point where the spectacle quickly fades and you just get annoyed at the place. The workers were clearly worn down from hours of dealing with the visitors - so much different to a Disney park where they are polite and happy even if they're dying inside.The ugly: This park is a money making factory - patrons in/001 spend spend spend/001 patrons out. We didn't get the express pass and after seeing what people paid for them we are glad. We got into the park for $67 each and I'm so glad we didn't pay more because we only got onto 5 rides. The wait times posted are guesswork at best - we waited in some 20 minute lines for over an hour/001 watching all the express pass visitors move past in a continuous line. It's honestly soul destroying. Disney have this system down to an art with fast pass/001 universal need to do some serious work to be on par.The prices of drink and food are atrocious. Expect to pay triple/001 even quadruple for everything. You can exit the park and grab something to eat from the nearby food court and get back in - do this to save some coin.All in all/001 we wish we'd done something else with our day. It was just too busy and too commercialised to be any fun. Kids will love it/001 adults not so much.
Shanttam J,None,10-Aug-17,Banana. Optimus. Coasters,5,943DCE6FEFCC04AC746628B982B5D1E0,Take the express pass if going on a holiday or on weekends/001 you feel the worth when you are going for roller coasters. See for the show timings and plan your day and rides accordingly.The must visits includes: Minions Show/001 water stunt show/001 transformers ride/001 roller coasters (both)/001 dinosaur water ride and 4D shows.For photos/001 rather take a barcode one in which later on photos can be downloaded rather than individual hard copies.
rniles,Panama City- Panama,10-Aug-17,Wonderful family time,5,551ABFFAA415B3713F344C4A99A456CF,Can't go wrong with Universal Studios. Everything is well organized and even when you're in line for 90 minutes/001 it moves along very quickly. Kids had fun!!
Lowrainedeer,None,9-Aug-17,Tips to Survive - Again,5,D4439504720818C387AF6A558B1F7D29,Here's my general tips - so many people miss this for some reason? Btw/001 I would rate myself as a 2 for theme parks (1 being never visited a good theme park/001 5 being theme park enthusiast all around the world/001 visited more than one USS)Best rides in my opinion:1.) Transformers2.) Mummy (love the surprise after the bugs! hahahaa)3.) Cyclon4.) Human5.) Rapids6.) Shrek (it hurt my neck and back though during the horsy ride :( Do be careful! )1.) Do not go on a weekend/001 or holiday. I went on a Monday/001 no holidays/001 and yet the queue is insane (for the regular) - the Cyclon ride had a 2 hr wait time/001 45 minutes for Express. Visited on July 3/001 but remember/001 you don't get to see fireworks. Maybe try going on a Tuesday instead? 2.) Do get the express/001 I was immediately in front for most rides. Do take note that there is ride there that does not accept express (the one near Jurassic/001 4 people) Canopy flyer I think (protip sit at the one facing back for surprises LOL). I took the $50 - one time ride for everything. I wasn't able to use all items/001 I wish there was a way I could research. Did they have an increase recently? I paid $50 for my express/001 but I see a comment below stating $70? (that's already unli during my time)3.) Be there early. Like WTF/001 I was there at 10AM and the line was already waaay long with multiple columns/001 but thankfully the staff opened more lines. :) I was in by 10:15 and the queue for Transformers was already two hours (it's worth it though! Also/001 I got the express pass and I was immediately first) You kinda feel bad for all those people you pass at the regular queue. Be there by 9AM then. You may take pics with the globe/001 but I recommend doing that later in the day before you go home ;)Majority of the people below who are complaining either: have been to bigger USS parks (can't compare/001 haven't been there)/001 or did not strategize well by visiting on weekends/001 holidays and coming in waaaaay too late.
Fai T,None,9-Aug-17,Fun Excitement ,4,1843A0CA81D14476ACB1E28377AA088A,It's good and fun/001 with most of ride and attractions are worth visiting. For full fun/001 we spend the whole day from opening to closing taking the most of worthwhile money spend. The food are real expensive/001 four times higher than outside food/001 but no choice as bringing food are not allowed/001 but compliments is there are refilling station for drinking water/001 so din't throw away empty bottles.
Matilda D,None,9-Aug-17,Amazing day!!,5,E5D7BBB9E7E05C9232D8C8F162915724,Had such amazing day!! The weather was up and down all day and a lot of rides kept getting closed which was a bit disappointing/001 but obviously not the parks fault. Very reasonable price for a theme park/001 and food wasn't too expensive inside either. I would suggest getting a fast track pass if you can as we waited in queues for 45minutes+ but we still managed to get on all rides as in the last hour there are 0 queues!! Would suggest going as early as possible due to queues etc. We didn't go while 12.30 which was a bit of a mistake. Definitely recommend going!!
jaywarriuk,Ashbourne- United Kingdom,9-Aug-17,Good but it's more for kids,3,981A3941BA3363203A5C9CFD0268A82F,The park is quite small with most of the attractions being for children. There are probably 4 rides that are for 'thrill-seekers'. These are the transformers ride/001 cylon/001 the mummy and human; and in that order for me. Most of the queuing areas were under shade/001 have fans and sometimes air conditioning. This was a nice touch as most queues were minimum of 30 minutes. I liked that you could join some rides as a 'single rider' which occasionally cut your queue time down/001 although this was dependant on how many people were also doing it. It was annoying that you couldn't do this on the cylon or human/001 there were often 2 or 3 empty seats on a car which already had a small amount of seats to begin with.The option to buy an 'express pass' (for an extra $50 ish) is a horrible idea aimed at wealthier people to literally push in front of people who have already payed possibly $65 + already to get into the park/001 this also increases the queue times. Money = privilege as always.I enjoyed my day here and I'm glad I came but on comparing to parks in the UK (alton towers and thorpe park) there really isn't any comparison. Universal Studios Singapore has less rides and costs more.
1968DSTL,Helensburgh- United Kingdom,9-Aug-17,Not as good as Orlando....,3,F6F6A6A16673822ADF5723F44065E1D8,Expensive and not as many shows or rides.completed the rides on a couple if hrs then just waited for a couple of shows. Won't bother again ...
Richard B,Singapore,9-Aug-17,Overpriced and extremely disappointing ,1,9EA2C62B0C633FB343D9556EF499FF4E,Visited Monday 7th August. Horrendously busy/001 had standard tickets and arrived at 11am. Massive queues to get in and had taken a day off to take my teenage niece as visiting from overseas. Asked about express pass/001 $70 for one time use at selected rides or $100 for unlimited/001 chose the latter thinking that would be best value.....how wrong could one be/001 biggest mistake was actually going in on such a busy day. Universal Studios Singapore (USS) can decide how much to charge depending on how popular the day is!! I suggest to USS that you charge more for quieter days and not for busy days as it's a complete rip off/001 huge disappointment for my niece. We elected to do what many trip-advisors recommend/001 visit the biggest most popular rides first. Well!! I would have expected an extremely expensive unlimited upgrade to get you on the rides a couple of time during the day/001 absolutely not possible/001 unless you want to forget doing any of the other park venues. All queue times in Express lane! Transformers queue time 45mins. Cylon queue time 55mins. Mummy queue time 30 mins. Human queue time advised as 45mins/001 took 1 hour 25 mins and from the bottom of the stairs to the ride/001 the standard queue people passed us/001 infuriating and the ride staff not interested despite many Express queue people complaining. Now/001 consider the waiting time above is 3 hours 35 mins/001 for 4 rides (EXPRESS!!) add in going to lockers as you cannot take any bag or loose article or phone on these rides and you get to about 4 hours. Then add in several of the other rides/001 some of which you cannot use Express pass/001 and we did none of the junior rides/001 add in shows .... and a sore point....queuing for Shrek 4D where someone had opened a rope at the door and everyone had gone into the Express entrance....lack of personnel (one at main entrance and one inside so no control) all of the above has waiting time/001 allow a 25min stop for lunch at 3pm (expensive and poor value for money at KT Grill) and we find ourselves up to 640pm and no second ride at any of them as not enough time before Waterworld show at 7pm. We then only had time for Lights/001 Camera/001 Action before everything stopped at 8pm. In all/001 just two of us with Express passes/001 with short lunch stop/001 did the following rides and shows from 11am-8pm with no second rides:1. Transformers2. Cylon3. Mummy4. Human5. Canopy flyer 6. Rapids7. A Crate Adventure8. Lights camera action9. Shrek 10. Donkey11. Waterworld. So if you think you want to do all these and more on a busy day/001 think carefully about the unlimited pass as not worth it and possibly buy the one time express pass/001 cannot imagine how miserable the people in the standard queue felt after their day. In all/001 two very unimpressed/001 unhappy customers and feel very aggrieved and ripped off about the price and lack of value for the Unlimited Express Passes.
JMMenace,Dunshaughlin- Ireland,8-Aug-17,Good day out,4,083FDDEC681EDBB2332E89D566675D21,Its as good as USA park but still worth a visit.There are a good selection of rides and roller coasters if your into that/001 3D and 4D rides are also very good.It can be very hot and humid here so be warned. Good selection of restaurants/001 etc.
AmilaX,Colombo- Sri Lanka,8-Aug-17,Great times!,4,5F030F832407DC3AD85CB6F4626F2A86,Come early as possible (8am) and buy tickets online( cheaper). be prepared to spend at least 5-6 hours and Loooooong Qs. Food and merchandise are higly expensive .
tarit1979,Gurugram (Gurgaon)- India,8-Aug-17,A Disneyland replica,4,5DB3C5FB75F7EB06896E73E6A1757C66,We went to this theme park after a year of visiting Disneyland in HK. Seemed as if we were re-visiting the place again. rides/001 4D movies/001 live shows etc. Good for kids. Do not go on weekends & late in the day. The queues at the rides are just too long. But if you want to have food then this place has got loads of options. Wish we had same parks in India.
Anne A,Reading,8-Aug-17,Fantastic day,5,23D07305AE16D96C0873C7D54026255A,We were able to get tickets at the gate with a fairly short queue. Worth waiting as we got senior priced tickets. Thoroughly enjoyed the shows and the rides we chose to go on. Plenty of food areas and places to buy drinks.
simonedls24,Paranaque- Philippines,8-Aug-17,Universal Studio Singapore is amazing!!!,5,181BC3724DE5E6AC535C5559EB31BB63,Universal was awesome!!! Buy a fast pass if you plan to go on a weekend!!! My kid was happy with the minions and the rides! I was amazed with the water world show!!! Must visit when in Singapore!!!
rearcardoor,Northampton- United Kingdom,7-Aug-17,USS with 3 kids,4,922F897EBCE80934A0BB665BDE7B51FF,This is a great theme park but a few things stop it getting a 5 star/001 which I'll explain later. We took an Uber to the Casino drop off point (inside a big car park) and from there there is a simple escalator to Sentosa. It saves costs getting across to the island and is a quick way in.Once off the escalator you are at the entrance to USS. If you have tickers then join the queue else visit a yello ticketing booth. The queues may be long but they move quite quickly. It is expensive and costs about 350USD for two adults and three kids aged 12 and under. What was really expensive was the express upgrade which was 100USD per head/001 so much more than the actual ticket price. So 850USD later we entered the park.It is really well laid out in a big circle split into a number of different zones. There aren't a massive number of rides but enough to spend a good day here. In the AM/001 the queues were ridiculous/001 up to 110 minutes for some of the most popular rides and even with the express tickets it was up to 20 minutes. The guys checking entry to the express lanes often exaggerated the wait times though/001 often saying 40 minutes when it was really 20.After 3 o'clock the queues were much shorter and most of the time you could walk straight to the front with the express ticket and even the standard ticket queues weren't too long.The quality of the rides is good and my favourite was Transformers/001 followed by the Ceylon ride (Battlestar Galactica grey loop - the red Human one wasn't so good)/001 then the Mummy. The rapids was also quite well done.We managed to do all of the rides/001 some 3 times/001 in one day.There are so many rest rooms/001 ice cream and drink stops and eateries but dond't surprised to have to pay 16USD for a hotdog. Most queues have water fountains and there are plenty of places to top up your water bottles/001 which you must take!Several of the thrill rides do not allow any bags/001 wallets or phones and they do provide lockers/001 free for the first 35 minutes or so.Make sure you visit the Spielberg movie set which simulates a hurricane/001 this was excellent and is right near the entrance.I do feel that it is a little expensive and they probably sell too many tickets in the AM as the queues were too long. I would maybe consider heading straight to the opposite side of the park and doing some of the less busy rides in the AM/001 saving the thrill rides for the PM when the queues are smaller.There is a free monorail back to the mainland/001 but we took the monorail to Imbiah and got the cable car back to harbour front/001 which was fun/001 but again not cheap. We did have a great day.
amichemie2016,Mumbai (Bombay)- India,7-Aug-17,A thrilling day spent at USS,5,B8D82ECEBA92CC4953AA12C07B975EB4,Purchase online tickets that will save your cost. Start early so that you reach early and dont need to wait in long queues. After 4 pm the queues get shorter. So you may come there late also. There are a variety of rides to experience. I loved the Transformer ride. Pls do not miss it. There are two kinds of Roller Coaster ride - Human and Gallactica. Human is lil easy as compared to gallatica. There are six zones like EZYPT/001 MADAGASCAR/001 HOLLYWOOD/001 FAR FAR AWAY/001 JURASSIC PARK/001 SCI-FI CITY. It is a full day activity.
billCarmel_NewYork,Carmel- New York,7-Aug-17,Worst universal of them all,2,80C16101FB4733C8E3747B5B47A08E4D,We have been to the other parks/001 Orlando and Hollywood/001 and by far this park( Singapore) is the worst I have ever seen. There is a problem with crowd control/001 they do not have enough staff to properly handle the crowds. From the entry gate to the rides there is a visible staff shortage. The rides are not properly staffed/001 causing a back log in the ride times. The Mummy ride for instance they do not stage the next car ahead of time they wait till it's already in/001 wasting time and efficiency. Same experience with Jurassic park ride. And it continues with the food service and etc.
frequenttraveller705,Lucena City- Philippines,7-Aug-17,Long queues,2,306C9994E471B225F87D935244FC1A9E,Soent much of our time standing in long queues because of the universal express ticket. This is one form of discrimination. Two tickets for the same show. Terrible
JattConnoisseur,London- United Kingdom,6-Aug-17,Felt like a kid again! ,5,22312C87847118B73FE810142E0A11F9,Great fun here! I felt like a kid again. Had so much fun! Definitely a must visit place in Singapore.
trevelyon,oakland,6-Aug-17,Weak compared to Los Angeles,3,B4EAFD9106B553928BFAEA7A2741CC03,Checked this place out with my 16 year old. It was just ok. Compared to Los Angeles/001 this place was like a small carnival you see at malls. We paid for the express passes to avoid the lines/001 which i recommend. The main roller coster was kind of boring. I noticed this place was kind of small. I expected a huge theme park. Worth checking out if your in Singapore but dont expect Los Angeles or Florida.
davidoM6483OP,None,6-Aug-17,visiting sentosa park,4,6D661FC98E424D22739CAD5F8ACBE700,we took the MRT to the stop for sentosa island. i would recommend buying tickets on line to avoid the first of many queues. also the extra $100 per person for premium access/001 whilst expensive/001 is worth it. 2 years ago we visited and being a single rider got you onto the ride quickly without shelling out the extra money. nowadays the crowds are so big that even as a single rider you will wait up to 40 minutes. the other thing to do is to take plenty of water. on a hot day you can dehydrate quickly. also - don't miss the water world show. it is a must see!! it fills up very quickly.
Naser A,None,6-Aug-17,Amazing Place!,5,6CBEEAABA5A5B6BE585448DA2444CC99,This is really a great place to enjoy/001 from the youngest to the eldest...Have all kind of rides.. I was here with my 3 kids... 10yrs/001 8yrs and 5yrs.. We really enjoyed all.. The best in my opinion is the/001 Transformers The ride/001 and the Battlestar Galactica in sci.fi section.. And the Revenge of Mummy in Egypt section..Don't miss the shows.. Have many..My favorite specially for kids is the Sesame Street : when i grow up..Don't go in peak season/001 if you go in peak season as i did.. I recommend buying the Express Universal Pass..So you and your family or friends will skip all the long que. And you will have the priority.. It costs $70 singapore dollar per person.. And you can use it as you like for many rides..
Karen F,kerikeri,6-Aug-17,Fun for all ages,5,49A3C0E5D8E2243E9F189815CDB425D6,We got there early and there were hardly any queues for the rides. So we had an absolute ball/001 trying the rides. Lots to buy/001 do and see. This is my current favourite theme park. I really loved all the themed areas to visit. New York had some amazing street dancers who invited members from the audience to dance too. It was fun. The Water show was spectacular with explosions and lots of water! Be warned- if you sit in the front seats you will get wet. The place was clean/001 inviting and fun. I can't wait to go again.
senakicir,Lausanne- Switzerland,5-Aug-17,Great Rides!,5,DC48A1FA78DD5EA6A7F0F0B41EB8FB13,This place has some amazing rides and very nice details (Far Far Away might be my favorite area of the park). My favorites were Transformers/001 Cylon and Mummy/001 in that order. I did not buy a six month pass and a single day was enough for me. Luckily I had a friend who knew the park and the queues very well and he managed to get us on almost all of the rides within a single day. If you don't plan well though you may not be able to fit all the attractions into a single day.A little tip: The Battlestar Galactica themed ride usually has a very long line - especially Cylon. It is amazing though and you should not miss out on it. So I recommend that you go on this ride as soon as the park opens.
Donzgel,Cabuyao- Philippines,5-Aug-17,Amazing rides!,5,F82B85BA788E8CAD1AFB91B8965D9937,A must-visit in Singapore! Transformers The Ride was super duper COOL!!! We waited in line for almost 2hrs and it's super worth it! This ride became my instant fave! Lol. Waterworld/001 The Mummy/001 Jurassic Park and Cylon are also a must! To save up some waiting time on the rides/001 you need to go here during weekdays though.
kalleviken,Stockholm,5-Aug-17,So expensive and suits younger children,3,D37DC7A326CB780315C9EED90B0AE472,Spent a day in the park with our 13 & 14yr old children and it was beautiful and also very expensive. Fast pass 70$ per person! The rides are not that thrilling so teenagers might be a bit (or very) disappointed. Two areas does not open until 11 so don't be too early. Two rides also closed for several hours. Many rides don't accept any bags/mobile in your pockets or hats etc so you have to pay for a locker (another 10$) each time you realise that. Stunt show is very violent/001 not suitable for kids under 15 I would say. Transformers ride the same! Not so sure who this park is for ? It got more quiet by the end of the day with very short queues.
stefanuswisnu,None,5-Aug-17,Time to play and have fun,4,C69540189BFA5B16FD8BCC22A3EBCCCA,very easy to reach this place by the MRT. Various attractions available take your time and beware of the holiday season cause it will be very fully loaded with kids. don't forget/001 Singapore is always hot.
Prabhat G,None,5-Aug-17,The best day with family! Look out for coupons!,5,81D5495EA82E5FB26FACB36E83D3D8CD,I was recommended by my friend to visit universal studios as she had been to the park in America and had heard that Singapore was also worth a visit. When looking through some leaflets that you get when arriving at Singapore airport I spotted some coupons that would get entry cheaper so keep your eyes peeled! We set out mixed with adults and young children and from the get go I was really impressed with the whole presentation of the park. We went on a few rides: transformers/001 mummy/001 Jurassic park all of which were absolutely fantastic/001 100% worth the wait of the queues which were about an hour. The water show is also very good/001 highly recommend. We finished the day watching Sherk 4D which was fun and then a beautiful firework show which happens at time 2030.I highly recommend a day out here with the family.
Ariba T,New Delhi- India,5-Aug-17,NIce place but overcrowded,3,53667C41A338C65FE6E5CD55D45C2911,A very nice place with an average experience as it was overcrowded and its very difficult to get access to all the rides without standing in long queues. We reached the place at 10:30 and could finish only 2 rides by 3:30. We finally decided to skip all rides and just look around the place. Food is also expensive inside but you will find a lot of eating options for Kids . It strongly recommend that you buy express pass at the entrance which will be very helpful. To give you an idea the waiting time for transformers ride was 1hr 40 mins for us.
David N,Tathra- Australia,5-Aug-17,Long queues  limited number of rides  little actual movie memorabilia,3,FA76942FB60A2C88323201D3A47EF432,If you have been to Universal Studios in California/001 or Movie World on the Gold Coast then you are going to be disappointed. On the other hand/001 if you haven't (neither my wife or 11 year old had) then you'll think it's OK. Most of the queues are at least an hour long. There is an express ticket you can buy for an extra ~$50 but I feel that is a bit rich on top of general admission. Transformers is a very good 3D simulation ride. The Jurassic Park raft ride fun and safe. I thought the Madagascar raft ride and the vintage car ride were fairly lame but very small children would probably enjoy it. It can be VERY hot in the middle of the day.
Stuffandthings,Perth- Australia,5-Aug-17,If you value your sanity...,4,68C7D6B758CE51D01C66B8F8A5155824,Ok/001 I wish someone had told me these simple tips to avoid crowds (and looooong queues)before I went: 1. Make sure you don't go on a Singapore Holiday or school break. 2. Go on a Monday or Tuesday 3. Any other day: invest in a skip the line pass. Just do it! So worth it if you value your sanity! 4. Don't miss the Transformers ride. You can thank me later.
Amit P,London- United Kingdom,5-Aug-17,Good but requires some improvement in service,3,A4B936D27AF1D4C39970A8C2051F255A,We bought our tickets online from a third party retailor called headout.com which was a mistake. Do not do this. Their website talks about express entry however when you get there you have to que again out side guest services to get your tickets and then que again to be let into the park so there's no express entry. Our friends you just turned up on the day and bought at the kiosk got faster service. I had bought a ticket groom headout.com for my 3 year old. My mistake as she didn't need one. I was told this when I got to guest services at universal studios. They couldn't give me a refund as they had accidentlu already printed the ticket. They asked me not to use the ticket and speak with headout.com I'm fortunately headout.com say they can't do anything and universal studios Singapore arnt getting back to my emails. So the moral of the story is just buy your tickets on the door. It works out cheaper and quicker. The rides were good and out small children enjoyed it. We bought express line upgrades which we used a little however these upgrades are really useful for the bigger rides that really small children wont enjoy.Saying that queuing in a normal que can be brutal for some rides.The western style food was poor. In Mel's dinner there was no vegetarian option amongst the burgers. In a city what is supposed to be international and culturally diverse and also has some great eating options at such a competitive price Mel's dinner in universal studios is a real let down!! Please provide a vegetarian option. The rides are good. Buy your ticket at the door. Consider the express pass if your kids are over 7 or 7 and want to go on the bigger rides. Try yo leave the complex and go out side for lunch (there s lots of good cheaper options just outside) if you must eat inside try one of oriental style food courts in the lost world area.
Om P,New Delhi- India,4-Aug-17,Amazing Place,5,11B2BB7F2C9B6C3D67CCFD9511381182,We had a great time here. 4 year old daughter just loved it. We reached at opening time/001 took the unlimited fast pass which was totally worth it as our daughter wanted to do many rides repetitively. Food is average. The attractions / shows were too good.
jdjv1020,Liverpool- United Kingdom,4-Aug-17,Good day out,4,288D890D86A7C129BEB943D7F10A066B,Brilliant day out which caters for all. The 3 main rides are worth the $70 alone.Had a couple of downpours which is expected but the rides will continue. The rides are only stopped when there is a risk of lightening which is good.
JSydAUSTRALIA,Sydney- Australia,4-Aug-17,What a fantastic time!,5,F4C527ED3CB499BAEA63E96310E95B55,Obviously if you travel with kids they´ll have a blast/001 but if you go on your own too. It´s got all the attractions as per current movies/001 plus great roller coasters. If you go in the Cyclone don´t do it just after breakfast. It´s a really powerful roller coaster/001 scary but good fun. In terms of queues expect avarage of 40 minutes on a weekend. I bought the express card for $80 at 10 am and I was basically jumping in and out attractions without waiting. The price changes as per demand/001 so the sooner you get it/001 the better.At Jurasic Park you´ll probably get your shoes wet. There´s a coin operator drying station but you can also go to a toilet and use the machine for drying hands. Leave your shoes there a few minutes and you´ll be ready to go in no time.Most attractions that involve sudden movements require you to leave all your belongings in a locker. There seemed to be lots of confusion on how to use them. THis is what you do:- Go to where the lockers are and use of the computers there. Select Rent locker.- You´ll see a place where to put your finger. Use your thumb once or twice (check what the screen tells you) and once your fingerprints are stored/001 the computer will assign you a locker. - Locate that locker/001 put all inside/001 and close it holding it for 3 seconds till you hear the actual locking mechanism.- Go and have fun.- Once you are done/001 go to any computer at the locker place and select Open locker. You don´t need to remember your locker number. Once you put your finger again/001 it´ll recognise your fingerprints/001 open the locker and show you on the screen your locker number. That´s all/001 locate it and clear it. There is no cost for the first 40 minutes.- At Jurasic Parc/001 lockers are not free.There are many options for food and coffee everywhere.Great place!
ywlim297,None,4-Aug-17,Always a good experience ,5,96D1BACB69594AFEC53D8128AC9DAD31,As we stay in Singapore/001 we enjoy visiting USS frequently. It is always an amazing time for us. However/001 there can be a long wait for rides so we would recommend using the express pass if you would like to try all of the rides.
khunnoomay,Bangkok,4-Aug-17,A GREAT fun,5,63A0FEC9F3ED56F6C6F898DCEA607989,With the Minions Break Out party event/001 it is a must to bring your little ones to enjoy a full day of rides/001 shows and fun. It got very very hot throughout the day.. prepare small fan and bottle of water! Toilet is clean and conveniently available.
venkatprabhu74,Singapore- Singapore,4-Aug-17,Lots of attractions  kids will enjoy,5,3F04343CD19E9EFA08E1E54DF012A565,There are lots of themes to see/001 there are rides for all age group... some good restaurant for quick bites. Kids will correlate some the stories they studied at school. Don't miss if you travel with kids
UrMajesty C,Dubai- United Arab Emirates,4-Aug-17,fun visit,5,D0A1D055C810D5F8E9A9BC116CEB5EFF,we had so much fun with most of the rides. i suggest to read some blogs about Universal Studio SG then get ideas where to go the moment ur in. comfy clothes & shoes is a must.
Mcai7,County Dublin- Ireland,4-Aug-17,Great,5,C3AC4C00F1DB2DA8E27B25EE8FBDF1E4,We went on a Sunday. It was very busy even though we went first thing in the morning. It was also very/001 very hot. If you can afford the express ticket/001 it is well worth it. The heat and the queues are tough going! The longest queue was for the Human ride. There was a 90 minute queue for non-express vs 30 for express. It was extremely hot. There are very few fans in the queuing areas. I think it would be quiet worrying to have young kids wait in this heat for a long time. It would be great if Universal could install more fans. Otherwise/001 most queues were 5-10 minutes with express pass. Cyclon was our favourite ride. There are various shows scheduled at different times that are well worth catching. The attention to detail in each section and ride is fantastic. It was a brilliant day out. If I was to go again at the weekend I would go later in the day to avoid the heat. The crowds are as busy throughout the day. Another tip is to rent a locker for the day. You cannot go on some rides with any bag or anything in your pockets. Also use it to store an extra set of clothes if you are going to any of the wet rides/shows.
rezaismantoro,None,3-Aug-17,Love it,5,4CE0960A43520A4DA510221DB6F5E23F,Great place to visit. Love the transformers ride and the mummy.. The details of the concept were awesome/001 Madagascar area also one of our favorite.. Definitely recommend for a family visit.. Food might need abit improve for taste.
crushed_soul,Manama- Bahrain,3-Aug-17,Its wonderful adventure,5,E0E9B7B0DD86228CDCD9F397618AD872,I am with my husband and my 5 year old daughter and 1 year old daughter /001 we went to most rides but only me and my 5 year old daughter and had lots of fun/001 my husband had to wait for us with our baby because all the ride we went they don't allow babies/001 i enjoyed the ride but i wished there was a roller coaster more thriller
Michael T,Newcastle- Australia,3-Aug-17,A family day out,4,CCF3F13C3CCE34628ECAD1B744DB2E5F,A great day out with loads of walking. The day was humid and although it didn't effect my family there were members of other families who were struggling with the heat. As others have pointed out if you can afford the express pass it is a must. The family were able to go on a total of 22 rides during the day/001 others we spoke to on the bus back to the hotel managed less that half of this.
Annie846,Singapore,3-Aug-17,Great rides suitable for all ages!,4,4107869BF1D93E969FB08F727FCFCFDA,Went with my 66 years old mum on a weekday. Initially I was worried that my mum will not get to enjoy the trip as we noticed that most of the rides does not seem suitable for riders with high blood pressure. Fortunately/001 my mum was okay with most of them! (minus the extreme ones of course)I was quite used to long waiting time in the queue after having experienced what it feels like to queue for 80~120mins in USJ. To my surprise/001 the wait time for USS was quite short even without fast pass! The shortest waiting time was 5mins (in the morning)/001 to 45mins later in the day. (family rides)I like the idea of them having a special queue for single riders. This shortened my waiting time for popular rides by a good 10-20mins!The place was quite small so a 1-day visit on a weekday could cover all the rides. Would suggest to queue for the more popular rides after 5pm and avoid the peak hours 2-5pm.The waterworld performance was worth watching too!
Parth V,None,2-Aug-17,Good place,4,A0F23F50C7CC9BB6589B148B4E73CBCF,I would recommend all the viewer to purchase the express pass because in regular pass there is so long que. The waiting time for each ride is 1 hour and more. So kindly purchase the express pass. Overall nice place and don't forget the mummy ride/001 transformers/001 rollercoaster galactica.
Reshma0905,Pamplemousses District,2-Aug-17,SUPERB THEME PARK,5,143AA8DA081E368C881C5535650F9CFD,A must place for all ages. you walk a lot but do not feel tired as its so wonderful. some long queues for a few rides.
OnlyLuxury,London- United Kingdom,2-Aug-17,AMAZING ATTRACTIONS AND RIDES,5,BD4EFAAE8D63E0EB7366834A19D71BCA,We visited during peak season so had to upgrade to the Express tickets! These were quite pricey but if you don't want to miss out or que up on the main attractions then get these! Had a fun filled day/001 lovely food to eat aswel inside. Transformer 3D ride is a must!! Had lots of fun filled memories in this Theme Park/001 would definitely visit again.
janey b,Scottish Highlands- United Kingdom,2-Aug-17,Good day out,4,6E2A18384F43C002D61D4C3B3432BAE8,We had a fun day out. Don't expect the scale of Florida! Queues were not too bad - we used the Sentosa app to check wait times and planned accordingly. Worth a visit.
MrW99,Balmenach- Scotland,2-Aug-17,Mini Universal,5,5A6D739C09FBBF108A3E92456F7B9EEF,This is not the reel thing but well worth a visit! We have been to Universal in the US a couple of times so had to go while in Singapore. We had a great day and the rides were excellent. Not the choice or the themes that you get in the US.
nel0not,Kapiti Coast- New Zealand,2-Aug-17,Wow,4,ADBD03B589DCBCA0517E7DE6D4743187,Fantastic place for families. Great rides and amusement for all ages but a fast pass is definitely worth the extra on busy days. The Human ride on BSG was 80 minutes at one point.....too long to wait for a 1min 30 ride......but it is awesome! The waiting lines before opening can be long/001 take a drink and some food for kids to keep them going. Some of the food we ate inside was a bit rubbish too TBH.
Josefin318,Umea- Sweden,1-Aug-17,Great rides  but be prepare to stand in line,4,AF708E6B41AA5BCFF023BCB681BD8AB7,We visited during a saturday afternoon - didn't have the possibility to go during the week. This meant that the lines to the rides were ridiculously long/001 over an hour. So we skipped most of the rides (but took the Egyptian ride in the dark) and just walked around and enjoyed the environment. If you can/001 visit during the week and come early. We caught the Hollywood parade as well/001 but weren't impressed. I might very well visit again if I come back to Singapore/001 but then I will arrive very early and buy an express pass so we have a chance to do all of the rides.
Ujwala_Bhat,Bengaluru- India,1-Aug-17,Wonderful!,5,DC58F389B14EE4BA4AB01C6F1F819191,Universal Studios is a must see place in Singapore! We happened to go there on a public holiday. It was crowded and we couldn't cover all rides. The Transformer ride is mind blowing...never miss it...some rides will have a waiting time of 2 hours:( so better plan on a day when there is less rush expected..
Ropet,South Africa,1-Aug-17,Full Day of Entertainment,5,426068CDF9662560B25EF71CCF24ECDC,2nd time in the past 3 years I've visited Universal Studios Singapore'- and it is a worthwhile day. Tickets cost around $65 Singapore Dollars and include a $5 discount on food above $10 and shopping above $30 or $35. The rides and shows were the same as my 1st visit - but great for young & old alike. Food in the park/001 like all parks is pricey/001 but you can leave and re-enter with a pass/001 with a McDonald's & some other options a short walk away. This is a full day visit/001 and would advise leaving some of the more popular rides till after 3pm - when the waiting time is half as long as in the morning.
FrndsLetsGo,Indore- India,1-Aug-17,Great Rides  Good Stage Shows  Expensive Tickets Endless Queue,4,F0E7342B4DCBBD49C94148120EDD4E97,Universal Studio One of the most visited tourist attraction has lot to offer to Kids and Ride lovers/001 we loved the whole feel and energy of the park however we wish there were more entertainment options (Stage Shows) for adults. It is very important for you to know more about the shows/001 timings and about rides so that you can make best of your time if you plan to take Roller coaster I would advise you to start from there as soon as you get in the morning hours the queue can be really endless in later hours and standing in hot afternoon hours is really a task. Tips: Do carry a Sun scream/001 Hand Fan and an umbrella as its too hot during afternoon and do not forget to carry a rain coat which you will require in Jurassic Park Ride and Water world Show. We bought the tickets for 62 Singapore Dollars which I believe was great price from a travel agency in little India called AVA's Travels. You can carry something to eat with you they do not stop from bringing something to eat drink as the food and Drink inside is very expensive there are water dispenser everywhere so you can refill also if you want to eat something less expensive you can actually exist Universal eat out and then Go back. There is Seven Eleven outside (BEST) and Malaysian Street where you get Indian Malaysian Thai food for good price
April0906,None,1-Aug-17,A nice experience  definitely a place for thrill-seekers,3,2031ACCA9E0CA7FB606A25B2AFE443A1,The place itself was okay but it is advisable to visit this place during the weekdays to avoid overbearing crowds and too long ride queues. The rides are definitely the best for those people who loves extreme and enjoyable rides
Ankita M,None,1-Aug-17,Must visit,5,5195149DFFF6B19255730E2AB7A1237B,Universal studio is one of the best amusement parks I have ever visited. They have Rides for kids as well as adults. One is transformer's one/001 which We personally liked the most. You get every kind of food/001 Indian as well :)They have 2 pretty big roller coasters.There is a part which is minion themed. There is minion dance in the evening/001 there are gift shops/001 which are a little expensive but you get lovely souvenirs. Please do visit. Kids will love it/001 adults as well. Visit will take more than 6-7hrs if you want to enjoy whole park.
DARREN Q,None,1-Aug-17,Long cues,4,5A0FC3988CE00E3087FB9AA675D31EDD,Great half days entertainment for young or old/001 but some long cueing involved!Definitely worth the experience
josiemig,Perth- Australia,1-Aug-17,Yahoo,5,6A06FF32FCF3363E539D04AEFC3E49C5,The best universal studio ever.So many choice and we don't manage to finished I round the places.We love the people in USS where they were friendly and attentive to our request.We will be back
Hazel L,Perth- Australia,1-Aug-17,Great way to spend a day,4,56FE4F785C708F51157303BC410E7BE2,We arrived at opening time (10am) and had to stand in a long line to get in even though we had repurchased tickets. Next time I would go later in the day and stay later as it is not so busy then and more than enough time to do things. If you purchase a ticket through your hotel it will often include free transport to get there. Shows aren't well advertised so take note of the times when walking around. We only saw a couple of street performers as we never timed it right. It's very small compared to California and one can easily 'do it all' in half a day. We brought our own food so that we had something healthy to eat at a reasonable price. Lots of fresh drinking water around.
gjy_12,Grande Prairie- Canada,1-Aug-17,It was a great day,5,A9292C98CC663719F41EA13969663D92,Universal is a must if you have the time ! The rides were all great fun with the exception of treasure hunters which was only really for the small children !! Our favourites were the transformers 3D ride and the Egyptian ride in the DARK The special effects show was great fun and the food offerings were as expected pretty genericDo it and love it
Jasbir R,Gurugram (Gurgaon)- India,31-Jul-17,An enjoyable experience,5,7F0409BE6C50779D6980D87FC7529676,checked out universal studios last week and enjoyed being at this place.. universal studios has a lot to offer to all kind of age groups.. the only thing that can be improved is the long wait time as had to wait for approx 2 hours to get on the roller coaster ride/001 spending a complete day is required if you do not want to miss out on anything at this place.. its is a must visit if you are in singapore.
Kim H,Brisbane Central,31-Jul-17,Awesome experience!,5,FCA03A7930B9861ABB5CDE7E4C8D05C9,We recently went to Universal Studios for the day. It was very hot and I was surprised at how many people there were there. In our group there were three adults/001 one teenager and two kids aged 10 and 9. Luckily my cousin bought us all an express pass. If we didn't have these passes/001 some of the line ups for the rides were around 2 hours (in the heat) so we would have only done one or two rides. With the express passes we got through quite quickly. Loved the Transformers ride and the Mummy ride. Very well done/001 really need a few days here though. Also food and drink is expensive/001 you can't take food and drink in and they check your bags. Great day. Loads of fun!
J9421NBannab,Tauranga- New Zealand,31-Jul-17,Well worth a visit.,5,D0A6FD15BED1767F3D077728A83B6DF0,Thoroughly enjoyed our trip here.Was amazed at the castle there. Totally looked like Disney land.Trains were great to help navigate the large area and lots of stalls and refreshment stops for hot days.We had an attraction pass and was well worth it. Got to see some amazing sites.
Majitas,Sydney- Australia,31-Jul-17,Awesome fun,5,DA00F8CD33CE8B8663254EE3A71A9AA0,Our family visited Universal Studios in July 2017. We arrived for opening at 10:00am and left at 8:00pm. We would highly recommend the Universal Express pass if you can do it. Its costly at $70 per person but saved us endless hours of queueing. Some queues (e.g. Human rollercoaster) we 90 minutes long but the Express pass got us on within 10 minutes. Our favourites rides were; Human v. Cyclon (don't attempt if you get motion sickness)/001 Transformers/001 Puss in Boots roller coaster/001 Madagascar and Sesame StreetWe were lucky enough to catch the Minion break-out party which was lots of fun.Expect crowds and expect queues. The park is organised well and staff are knowledgeable and safety conscious which was great.The food was average but we may have been unlucky. There seemed to be quite a big selection of eateries so make sure you plan where to eat before it gets to lunch/dinner time.Overall/001 we had a great day and would highly recommend the park.
Emboo81,Stevenage- United Kingdom,31-Jul-17,Fun,5,77C21B6D608E3C6964DB2FB140315267,Great fun and worth a visit.We didn't have to wait long for rides  it's great day out but be warned the food is very pricey.
Piyush S,None,30-Jul-17,Amazing.....,5,145105DED4127BB88638A8CCB3D93417,We were total 4 adults and 1 infant /001we went in july 2017/001weather was ok.It was real fun/001s must must go place if visiting singapore/001 for all ages.Some of the best rides are transformers/001 battlestar galactica/001 rapids adventure/001 revenge of the mummies/001shrek and human vs cyclone (mind blowing).We also easily got stroller for my baby /001and we all enjoyed here.
FoTheLoveOTravel,Bengaluru- India,30-Jul-17,For kids & kids-at-heart!,5,C81A71F78083983CEF607E5A53858029,I was skeptical about enjoying my time at Universal Studios since I had gone to Singapore with my daughter & my mother. On one side was my daughter who was excited about this & on the other was my mom/001 who/001 I was worried will find this trip a tiring one! Luckily for people going to Universal Studios with senior citizens or children/001 wheelchairs & prams are available on rent & we made the best use of this facility :)The Park is divided into 7 zones/001 Madagascar/001 Sci-Fi/001 Lost World/001 Ancient Egypt/001 Far Far Away/001 New York & Hollywood. Each zone has a number of attractions and a couple of roller coasters or roller coaster-style rides. Since mom was in a wheelchair/001 we got priority entry at almost all the rides & that saved a lot of time because of which we were able to enjoy almost all the rides (well/001 except for the roller coasters which we were freaked out about!).Apart from the rides the park also has some amazing live shows scheduled at specific timings. We caught a few of them. The park has good options to eat in as well. It was a day well spent and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves
DiDi41,Adelaide- Australia,30-Jul-17,Waste of money unless you get a skip the line pass !,3,2594103DE2943DA9EA97925721303687,We took the cable car over to Sentosa and headed to universal studios where thousands of others were doing the same......we hadnt purchased a skip the line pass (wish we had) cause after doing a couple of rides and having a walk around the place was sooooo packed that most of the rides had 1hr - 1- 1/2 hr waiting times - this was really disappointing as we really wanted to do the transformers ride...this line up had over 2 hr waiting time ! I must admit I had been to Universal Studios in LA and thought it was much better so didnt rate this one too much. My tip - purchase the skip the line pass !!!
Mohd Amrin J,None,30-Jul-17,Fantastic outing with the Transformers ,5,84796871083D0801506FBDED39DE4239,Had a fantastic outing with my daughters and grandson at Universal Studio.Visited the Transformers and watch a lot of shows/001 especially like the Minions performance.Great food for everyone/001 Halal food at Mel's Drive-in.Good for the park with so many visitors and tourists but a long wait for the rides/001 especially the twin roller coasters. It was an exhilarating ride/001 worth the wait.
edmund c,Singapore- Singapore,30-Jul-17,Consider quite good if not compared with others,3,DD2E632D34BF895CBF3C60D4772A286A,If you haven't been to other universal studios in US/Japan/001 this one consider quite a good attraction when you visiting Singapore. Definitely good top spot if you want to spend good time with your children. But be ware of the extremely hot whether in Singapore. Most attraction need to queue about 45 minutes (average).The food inside is not excited/001 but you ought to know themes park food should not expected too much.
Tina B,United States,30-Jul-17,Don't go to universal during holidays ,5,45A42E9DE8611DC84A9D434E4DA32FD9,I always go to universal with my friends. June was and eid Mubarak were the worst time to go to universal because it was super crowded. You need to wait at least 1 hour to play. I don't think that I will go back to universal for that. I don't want to go there anymore.
Stevenson U,Quezon City- Philippines,29-Jul-17,It's universal studios! how can you go wrong?,5,E8D1DED6EF05C324EC92A92D475B3648,well except for the fact that it is much smaller compared to that of california's (the tram ride alone prolly has the same area as the whole of universal studios singapore already!)but you know.. if you haven't been to hollywood's or been a while since you've been to hollywood/001 this place is still a great place to visit. I skipped waterworld stunt show as that show's been around since as long as i can remember and have seen it so many times already. but it's a good show for those who havent seen it yet.I enjoyed the transformers ride/001 i didn't think i would like it having hated the michael bay movie franchise/001 but i really did/001 and so is the puss and boots roller coaster. the mummy ride is so old now as it's been around since forever in UShollywood. still fun to ride with the old mummy franchise with imhotep and not the ton cruise version! The shrek 4d/001 they need to calibrate the projector for mirror on the wall on the pre show section of the attraction. the 3d movie itself is pretty dated now. the animation is pretty choppy by today's standards. maybe it is time to update with a new 4d feature.Sesame Street show/001 it features Bigbird/001 Ernie/001 Bert/001 COokie Monster/001 Elmo/001 and abby cadabby (debuted in 2006) doing some song and dance. and i enjoyed it so much. FAST PASS. NO NEED to get a fast pass. Just go to the park on a weekday/001 and choose the ride that matters the most. Just be patient with the queue.And by 6.30pm/001 you can pretty much go into any ride in the park with zero wait time. from 6.30 to 8:00 i was able to go to the mummy ride twice/001 the car ride once/001 the madagascar boat ride once/001 transformer twice.. and got into the final show of Shrek 4d. Also needs to update the studio set attraction. Spielberg does not look that young anymoreFood: Food in the park is what you expect. higher than normal prices/001 but they're not prohibitive. especially if you are able to get one of those food vouchers/001 then the food becomes really reasonably priced. Warning: the park becomes VERY EXPENSIVE if you bring in children. The place is pretty much one giant toy store. Kids and toy stores equals empty pockets for you and me. In Summary/001 it's Universal Studios/001 folks! it may be much smaller than US's theme park/001 but it can still be so much fun for everyone. Try walking around and then seeing Shrek and Fiona outside the castle taking pictures with park guests and not get excited.
Aang174,Jakarta,29-Jul-17,Need a better clean up,4,F52B12A6397AC90C7EA2C145A01B7CE4,Summer holiday was over in Asia/001 most students should have been back to school but oh my God/001 USS was still crowded!!We need to line up in quite a long queue (around 50m) to enter the gate.And for exciting ride like transformer/001 mummy and jet coaster cyclon and human the waiting time was 60 minutes. Gosh!!Next time I remember to buy the Universal Express line to cut the waiting time.Fortunately in the evening it was getting better when we entered Transformer once again when the waiting time sign was 20 minutes.But inside the exhibits I found dust everywhere. Not comfortable looking at dust while you were queueing.
michellelui2412,Hong Kong- China,29-Jul-17,Great fun for kids and adults,5,52BB1A124806F275F7382F50761ABEF2,My kids and I enjoyed most of the rides there. For my younger kids who is around 120 cm/001 she could still play most of the rides. We purchased the unlimited express thought it costs SGD 90 each for both adult and kid on Friday. The price for the express varies day by day and would be even more expensive on Sat and Sun. The unlimited express helped us save a lot of time as we skipped all the queues. For most of the time/001 we could play the rides in 5 to 10 mins. We finished trying all the rides and even played 3 or 4 times for some rides in 8 hours. Better reserve a whole day for USS especially if you have kids. Bring swimsuit for your kids as they can have water play near Jurassic park. Bring water spray and portable fan for cooling down. If you are not going to buy the express/001 better arrive the park early and play popular rides like Human before the queue is too long. You need to wait for an hour for the roller coaster 'Human' on Fri afternoon.
Kanch91,None,29-Jul-17,Expensive..... ,3,D1FB50952552172D119952B8F330B346,Nice place and my daughter was very happy with this fantasy place but quite expensive place. Hope to visit again.
Mimi A,Glen Waverley- Australia,29-Jul-17,Disappointing,2,CE9330984CEEE3AAFD9685E2420355BC,Had an express pass to enjoy this theme park as we have truly enjoyed our last one in Japan. This Universal Studios was a massive disappointment as there are lesser exciting rides to enjoy. The express pass was useful as we were able to skip queues from the streaking hot weather. By 2 pm/001 we had already enjoyed all rides + lunch and went to re-do some rides as we thought for what we paid for/001 we really did not make a whole use of it. Just be warned that food and drinks (as in any theme parks) will be expensive.
karintravellog,Singapore,28-Jul-17,Great Rides But Many People,5,377A5230F73FC1660136F28302A772C5,We were here in December 2016 and expected many people as it is the school holidays and festive season in Singapore. We purchased the fast pass and our entry tickets a few days before.The waiting time for rides is stated outside the attraction. Lucky for us/001 we have the fast pass which means almost no waiting time. The only thing is the lockers where we have to put our belongings. It was packed and some people were hogging the screens because they did not know what to do/001 if not/001 they were not willing to pay for the lockers. The weather is also incredibly warm and humid.We had a nice time in Universal Studios Singapore but it would be better if there was more cool air. People who did not purchase the Fast Pass must have waited at least an hour for each ride as we saw on the screens. Rides were of different types and were very interesting. Go early at 9 or 10 and stay till they close. You will not be disappointed. Highly recommended when you are in Singapore!
Nguyen X,Hue- Vietnam,28-Jul-17,Good park,4,F0E4B642E5B13C989A5B251CC6EEB12E,Spending a half day here/001 a beautiful site/001 crowd of people. Besides of universal studios/001 there is a big malaysian restaurant/001 try it for lunch
Richard B,Torquay- Australia,28-Jul-17,So Busy there must be safety issues,3,96F4AF28F863A60A4B1105A6858A50B0,We waited 45 minutes just to get in the front door with pushy Indian and Chinese people trying to barge in front of us. Staff a joke for doing nothing about it right in front of their eyes so had to take charge of the situation myself. Our 3 children really enjoyed the day and did not mind the massive queuing as much as we did. Best part was staying to the end of the night and getting to actually do the Transformers ride and the 2 Galactic coasters. The Waterworld stunt show was a definite standout. Would I return/001 absolutely not. I am glad I did not pay extra for the express pass as those things get sold like they are lollipops and not worth the extra dollars. Every Tom/001 Dick and Harry had those things and seems pointless/001 why not limit the amount of people you let in the park and also buy the express pass. You just look super greedy and makes me feel less bad about downloading.
ShreyasSrinivas,Bengaluru- India,28-Jul-17,Crowded and disappointing,1,9473EE3FB955C9B8DBCC6601E8E4BC7E,This park is a victim of its own success. Went with a few friends on a weekday to avoid the weekend crowds/001 but looks like even the weekdays aren't spared. Average wait times for the popular stations range from 60-100 minutes. Further aggrieved by the frequent technical breakdowns. We felt like we spent the whole day in queues- barely managed to do 4 rides. Furthermore they've stopped the monsters rock show/001 which was probably the best show in the park.All in all/001 this is a park that has sacrificed customer experience for short term profits/001 fueled by the Chinese tour groups. Personally am never going back again.
richardhudson5,Gravesend,27-Jul-17,Great family day,4,35D7672EE313AE5F07030A44E89B0862,Just what you'd expect from Universal. Slick/001 enjoyable and well organised. Great mixture of roller coasters/001 rides and entertainment for little ones. Not enough roller coasters for the hard-core thrill seeker.
racetony,None,27-Jul-17,Worth a visit but nothing special,3,22C87E38033B5432EC13E93CF2B6DB4C,The roller coasters Human and Battlestar Galactica were good but they only have 2 seats per row. 100min waiting time standard. You should buy express tickets otherwise you spend the wholeday waiting. We bought the tickets there and spent about 140$ per person which was very high. You should buy the tickets online because they are cheaper there.Last but no least I can say the trip was cool. It is just very expensive and you might get more quality if you visit one of the parks in the US.
channie962,Ulaanbaatar- Mongolia,27-Jul-17,Had so much fun there!!,5,902BBE6E2F2BB168D082886F1114BE52,If you come to the Singapore/001 then you must visit Universal Studios. there are 7 zones/001 the attractions were truly amazing. some of them are so thrilling. i really enjoyed here. the price for an adult is 76 SGD. its worth visiting. i would definitely come back here.
Judith B,Northants,27-Jul-17,Fab day out!,5,D6AE2602DB0FF8C8FA0765D9AB389893,Brilliant day out/001 all queue times were accurate and constantly moving. Transformer ride is a definite must.
Rich_NZr,None,27-Jul-17,WARNING WARNING WARNING,1,63A85235DB4CCBB0AD54E2C3C58A1EC2,Ok so I vowed that I would never post a negative review on here but this was such a dissapointing experience I have to warn everyone about it;I planned on purchasing the express pass once inside the park as advertised on the website ( extra $30.00 )... As a taveller I only brought enough cash with me to the park to cover the passes + food.When I got to the park entrance they informed me the express pass was instead going to be an extra $70.00 each due to 'dynamic pricing' (wtf?!)...We had no option but for me and my 13yr old daughter to go with regular passes instead and wait in line...When I say 'wait in line' I meant we were at the park for about 6 hours/001 only got to go on about 6 mediocre kiddie style rides which lasted about 2-3min each (actually) - spending the rest of the time sweltering in the ridiculous heat - until my daughter finally gave up & decided we would have more fun back at the hotel pool.Okay so the fact that I didnt bring more cash to the park is totally my fault/001 and I accept this/001 but there is more to this story...The waiting times posted at the gate to each ride... Even the mediocre rides stated a 30min+ wait time throughout the day which actually means a 60min+ waiting time to go on a ride designed for 9yr olds... Really dissapointed as the only 2 decent rollercoasters posted wait times of over 2 hours throughout the day - Obviously we missed out riding on those...When I asked again about the express passes on the way out of the park the price had gone up to $80.00 - And I can only assume it would keep going up as the day wore on & park guests became more fruatrated with the the lines...There is nowhere near enough rides in this park to satisfy the number of people who go here - the day I went was not peak season so I cannot imagine how much worse it would have been in school holiday time.Warning to everyone reading this - Just buy the express pass online before you go to the park & give them the excuse they need to push the price up even further.Not what I expected.

Gould h,None,10 May 2017,Wonderful Family Time,5,9BD93B2DAC53DA55AFAA6C079F8B2647,"The trip to Universal studio was a truly unforgetable experience for our children. It is a must-see if one visits Singapore for pleasure. Tickets are a tat expensive but still worth it since we are on vacation. It can be tiring and there are many rides / adventures that we tried which adds to an overall exciting time.

Jennifer H,Elanora Qld.,10 May 2017,Great for young and old!,5,2379C08306025233357FA6CCBC2195EE,"The best tip I can give is to purchase the Express tickets for your visit. When the queues have a waiting time of 40 minutes + for a ride you will thank me for this advice. We simply showed the pass at the gate and were promptly shown the pathway up to the front of the queue. We went during the week and not school holidays and it was still busy. Great attractions - especially the Transformers 3D. Lockers are free for the rides where you are not allowed to take bags etc. Well run and very clean. Food was well priced as were the drinks. You can book on line and save but be sure of the day that you want to attend.

MalDann,Perth- Australia,10 May 2017,Very Family Orientated,4,F4DC0E0FFDB77FA005EB7E077ED518D9,"This attraction is very good for family fun. There are many things to see and rides to suit all ages. We spent a good day here and the attractions vary to meet all of a family's requiremnts. Waiting lines when we went were quite good at approximately 20 minutes each ride. We went mid week. The grandkids loved their time here and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and rides. The cost for express lane was quite rich so we decllned/001 however I believe there was not a benefit on the day we went. Might be benefictial on weekends. Have been here twice and will go back again.

Although paying an extra 60 SGD even for a 5 years old kid is outrageous !!A very good family time in Sentosa for sure/001 and most probably the highlight of the trip

Shelley W,Tyabb- Australia,9 May 2017,Nothing to the original,3,334B30F6411A10FC2529588FA4870581,"Was disappointed to see how different this one was compared to the original one in America. Not only is it smaller with fewer rides but the customer service was disappointing. We had paid extra money to get unlimited rides passes but was a waste of money due to the lack of rides and also due to rides being closed because of the rain (no one can control the weather) but when you can't go on rides and than you have to pay money to buy a plastic poncho just so you can go somewhere else in the park/001 so you can some kind of dry. Now that makes me angry.Save your money and go to USA. You will get the whole experience.... great rides and customer service with a smile and a laugh

Santosh R,Pune- India,9 May 2017,Adventurous experience with pouring adernaline,5,0D7FC802683DEC5216E9ABA625DA80A9,"It is a theme and amusement park located within Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) on Sentosa Island/001 near Harbourfront. It is the second one after Japan in Asia. This popular Hollywood series has more than 20 attractions. You should not miss upon the Canopy Flyer Roller Coaster/001 Jurassic park rapid Adventure/001 Water World Arena/001 Revenge of the Mummy and the Transformer. The queue is quite big and the wait time is around 20-30 minutes during weekdays but even longer on weekends. I would suggest you to avoid weekends but if you do not have any choice then plan your movement right and start the tour around 3 PM and finish all major ones till 6 PM. In many rides you are not allowed to carry any bags or in some rides not allowed to wear glasses. Therefore either handover all stuff to any of your friends or else use lockers to keep your stuff before you start your ride. Some of the rides are quite boring so do not waste your time over their rather select the once you are enjoying and repeat them as many times.

Esther A,None,8 May 2017,The park I enjoyed most!,4,EC4035BD214EF28B8F2DD7CB4905EC2B,"There are many fun places in Singapore/001 but I like Universal Studio very much although the entrance fees is quite expensive. The original price per ticket is S$73 but I got it with S$63 from my friend. FYI/001 there are another types of tickets which can skip queuing when you visit but this is a bit more expensive. When you arrive at the park/001 I would like to suggest you to take Universal Studio Map to explore the whole park. For me/001 I check which part of the park I would like to try first. After riding roller coaster or sth/001 I ticked the attraction which means I've already riding. By doing that/001 we can cover the park as much as we can. I would like to recommend to visit the park early so you can spend much time there.If you are a roller coaster rider/001 you should try these first as many people enjoy to take these also. For us/001 we have to queue over an hour to ride the Red one. For the convenience and safety of people/001 they place lockers near roller coasters. The lockers are allowed to use 75mins for free and they will after 75mins. Note: You are not allowed to bring any items if you would like to ride roller coaster. They will lend money if the lockers usage hour is more than limited hour.We took - Roller Coster (Red and Grey)/001 Transformer/001 Egypt/001 4D movies/001 Madgadascar.There are many show times in different places in the park. Before you visit/001 check that pamphlet in case you might see your interest.PS: I would like to suggest before you visit there. Please check the weather because when we visited/001 there was a rain with tremedous thunders. So/001 some of the places were shutting down in order to safe.

I suggest getting in early to get on your favourite ride as quick as possible and to avoid the crowds. If you have time restrictions and don't have a budget or money worries then i suggest the Quickpass/001 we bought it and it was the best $50 dollars spent ever/001 waiting in a line for an hour when its 30 degrees C isn't funny or time well spent. Be mindful that many rides rides have height restrictions so go online and view minimum height requirements. There's is lots of place to eat and get out of the heat.

Cheaper and quicker. It was fun as you'd expect. The fun was dampened by the long lines (I'd hate to be here in high season). Unless you pay an extra $50 for an express pass be prepared to wait (& wait). The express pass gives you priority to get on rides above others who have only paid the entry. The universal studio shop was good as was the shriek 4D and many others. Couldn't wait 60+ mins to get on the roller coasters (that last about 1 min).

marriedplustwo,Singapore- Singapore,6 May 2017,Incredible time but you need a fast pass,5,FE49B3994D9F0F406A2FC77416A7C1D7,"We live in Singapore and therefore decided to invest in the annual membership with the fast -track passes and we do not regret it! We went Several time of course and every time we discovered something new. The Three main roller coasters are the Red one: high speed classic roller coaster the blue one :for advanced crazy roller coasters lovers as you will go high speed and upside down several time) and the Mommy ( which is genuinely great but also scary). Universal studio shows are also very good!! The transformers is not too bad either. The few issues that you need to be aware:1- Fast track passes are key of happiness!!! Very Long line and Locals are used to queue so they are not afraid to wait for a full hour or more ( I can not!!).2- The food is very bad and Super $ anywhere In the park so avoid or bring your stuff however there is an air conditioned little food street area that is delicious and cheap 30 Sec walk from the park and other good (more expensive) restaurants. If you want to eat well I suggest you Get out for 30min and return. 3- More often than one of the two roller coasters blue or red are down for maintenance so better call before or ask before paying your ticket if you do not have an annual pass. If the weather is bad it is 100% guaranteed that they will stop the blue and red roller coasters as they are outside. For young kids also lots to do/001 shows/001 Elmo/001 puss in boots/001 Shrek/001 etc...Enjoy!

Pictureant,Reading- United Kingdom,6 May 2017,Lovely Theme Park on a Lovely Island,4,C2637038A322DE0280197943B7309BF9,"Being Singaporean and having been to Sentosa since my school days/001 It was really nice to be back after over 15 Years for a visit and this time with my teenage daughter. Having been to many theme parks all over the global /001 perhaps I was slightly disappointed with the overall size and coverage of the Park but overall it was very enjoyable to look around and take photos at the various attractions. My only negative would be the pricing as i felt it was slightly overpriced for what was being offered/001 but my local school friends did warn in my advance anyway so at least i knew i wasn't being overly critical as locals felt the same way/001 so if you are thinking of going buy the combination ticket to get some savings.

grace9770,None,5 May 2017,Need to add more rides,3,9918EBB25E13967DBD2923B60F9188A4,"USS is a typical theme park where you can become a kid again and enjoy reminiscing all movies you watched through rides and other activities.I just hope Singapore can think of other rides or activity cause been here for 5 x since instayed in Singapore and it feels a little tedious going around since you already knew what to expect. Everytime I have a visitor coming over Singapore /001 we come here and tour them around.All others same same.

First/001 sentosa monorail broke down that day. Long queue from vivocity to sentosa through RWS bus. When i reach universal studios - i see a huge queue.It was really crowded on tuesday that was not holiday - but still. I upgraded the ticket with express pass for $50 SGD per ticket - that is steep; but it helped me cover all the activities. After i entered/001 we had huge rain pouring for 2 hours!! I am eternal optimist! - still i had loads of fun even with all glitches. I ensured crowd and weather never got in way of having fun with my family. So you can do it too!For vegetarians like/001 you need to go near Egypt restaurant for veg food - very limited options elsewhere. Please do the canopy ride and treasure hunt first since there is no express pass for it.

I highly recommend the Transformers ride which was very exciting. The only down side is that we got to Universal Studios by about 10 a.m. and after standing in a queue that was not very long for the tickets/001 once we joined the queue for the Transformers ride it took approximately an hour from the beginning until we reached the end of line as it extremely long since you cannot see the end of the line at any given point until you reach the very end. It keeps curving inside different chambers for a long time.

There were long queues but as I was alone I could use the single rider line which saved me a load of time! The water show however was the highlight and yes you will get soaked if you sit in the blue bit... unfortunately the parade was cancelled as they thought it was going to rain (though in the end it didn't) and as I went on a weekend they put on fireworks on the lake which is a nice way to end. What was really nice was that when I left after the fireworks there wasn't a huge queue for the cable car which Iexpected....

Roberts R,None,4 May 2017,Amazing day spent !,5,C91F8F8B80C13C8D480EBF947C1005D7,"First I must start with saying - Fast Pass is a must !! With Fast pass it took still all day to get through everything and you definitely save quite a lot of time of not queuing up too much. Just for example - Jurrasic park ride (fast pass queue - 15min /001 normal 2h 35min). Attractions are amazing. Most of them would suit kids/001 but much fun for adults. Transformers is a must for any 3D enthuasist ! It was just lifechanging experience for me in theme parks ! Now i can never look back at other attractions after visiting it. On the other side - I must say /001 everything seemed quite cheap and affordable/001 but food however wasnt the best one in the dinner they had.

Go on time - 9AM/001 they open the gates/001 be present when they open the gates/001 so that you can atleast goto few attractions without much queue2. Take the map present in the entrance gate. It has a detailed explanation on the rides along with the age groups applicable. Spend some time and read the map carefully. So that you can decide upon which ride to take and which ones to skip3. Few shows here happen only on specific timings/001 so plan accordingly/001 if you want to see them.4. There are a lot of lockers available across the attractions. The locker available with ""Revenge of the Mummy"" is free for 45 minutes and then the charges start applying for every hour. But the locker available with ""Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure"" is charged from the first hour itself. So/001 think before using lockers. 5. Have some 2 dollar change in your own packets if you are dropping your luggage in lockers. The locker does not return you change/001 if you pay in excess. Have always dollars in multiples of 2 to avoid excess payment.6. Once you enter Universal Studio/001 decide whether you want to go in clockwise direction or anti-clockwise direction. Once you start a ride in a particular direction/001 do not change sides. It will waste your time. 7. Do not miss the Transformers ride - it is the best in the lot. Also/001 please go for Jurassic Park ride/001 Mummy's ride and the water show organized by stunt people. If you want to skip the lines and go fast for the rides/001 you can take express tickets. This place is crowded all round the year. so be prepared to stand in the queue for over an hour/001 if you get into the above mentioned rides late in the day. Food is available inside universal studios/001 which we felt was a little costly.

aidarulz,Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia,3 May 2017,Good family theme park,4,6BC21269A1DD59D7D788D94A4807E52B,"It's a fairly big theme park with rides suitable for all ages. I've been there twice and I've got to say my favourite is the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. For families with young children/001 I would recommend starting with Hollywood & New York (where the Sesame Street rides are) and work your way counter clockwise (Madagascar/001 Far Far Away/001 Lost World/001 etc.). The rides in those zones range from the most child-friendly to the more daring ones for older kids/adults. The queue can get very long very quickly and the average wait is often between 30-45 minutes even on a non-school holiday period. Best is to get to USS as early as you can and go straight for the rides you really want to go on first. My choices would be:a) Revenge of the Mummyb) Jurassic Park Rapids Adventurec) Canopy Flyerd) Enchanted Airwayse) Puss In Boots's Giant Journeye) Transformers The Ride : The Ultimate 3D BattleIf you hate waiting in line for too long/001 you can either purchase the express passes for a steep fee or queue up in the single rider lane (if you/your group don't mind riding separately).

It has all the feel of a Universal Studios. Food and drinks are expensive but if you plan for that it won't be a shock. About $6.50 for a bottle of water. I read the Trip Case reviews before going so arrived early on a Wednesday at 09:30am and there were already about 1/001000 people lined up! I was going to tough it out but the heat was too much so I purchased an express pass for $50SGD. It allowed me priority entry well ahead of the big crowd and a maximum wait time of only about 5 mins! I only rode 4 rides because of my timeframe. Transformers/001 Cyclone/001 Battlestar Galactica and The Mummy but it was worth it! It is hot and sticky in the line and some do not have air conditioners only fans going. The express allowed me to bypass the crowds. The staff here are fantastic with queue jumpers. They simply redirected them to the back of the line politely and won't engage in any further conversation with them and usher you forward. Don't forget to pack a hanky or flannel for the sweat. I will definitely be back again for a full day.

Please purchase the Express Pass if you want to enjoy the rides with minimum waiting time.- Food was quite OK/001 had lunch at the restaurant near the Madagascar area. - Due to the gloomy weather towards the evening/001 most of the rides has stopped including the parade at the Hollywood lane.- I am aggrieved of the condition of the prayer room; which is located at the back and only can accommodate 5 persons at one time (in each male and female room). Perhaps the Management can allocate a dedicated area which is more comfortable for the Muslims to pray.

Each ride takes 60-90 minutes in never ending queues in Singapore hot weather and for a mere 2-3 minute ride. The entire amusement park is too small and over-hyped. The children below 10 years cannot enter so many rides. If you are still keen to visit the place/001 enter through single rider queues.

Kim M,Logan City- Australia,2 May 2017,Transformer 3D ride and Cylon Ride are the best,3,6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86,"Firstly to be fair we live near all the theme parks on the Gold Coast in QLD Australia and because we go to these on a regular basis we couldn't help but compare USS to these. My husband and I both agree that it pales in comparison to what we are use to getting from our theme parks here in Australia. We found that there were only really 4 rides for adults (the two dualing roller coasters/001 transformers 3D ride and the mummy ride) and that the rest are all kid rides. These four rides were great but after riding them/001 and then watching the waterworld show there was nothing left for us to do there. There was excessive amounts of stores and restaurants and plenty of kids rides/001 so would be better for families I imagine. Also I wouldn't even attempt to do USS without buying the express pass. The lines were ridiculously long and we were thankful we spent the extra money. The Cylon ride was pretty much always at around an hour long. Getting into the park itself was also a joke we got there at bang on opening and waited for 40minutes in line just to get in and we went on a weekday. Overall we had a good day but we only spent four hours there all up and paid just over a hundred dollars each for the tickets and express pass/001 so it was an expensive four hours.

A TIP: The express pass is a MUST! Yes/001 it does make the day rather expensive but we did not have to wait for more than 5 mins for any of the rides. The waiting time for some of the rides was 80 mins. By having the express pass we were able to go on all the rides and everyone was happy! We bought the express pass which gave you one turn on each ride - there really is not enough time to do each ride more than once.

The long queue for Transformer ride ran into multiple halls and two levels/001 which reminded us about the queue at Shirdi temple. There are no pure vegetarian eating joint inside USS and looks like a good business opportunity for Kailash Parbat/001 Anand Bhawan/001 etc Despite above issues/001 we had a great time and memorable trip. The most interesting rides were Jurassic park/001 Transformer/001 Madagascar/001 Speilberg show.

We pre-purchased our tickets (recommended) prior to getting to the park/001 so avoided the box office queue. We also purchased our VIP pass for the rides inside the park (definitely recommended) which gave us access to walk up starts to all rides/001 rather than queuing for 40 odd minutes. We loved our time there; some highlights: the Madagascar ride/001 the Sesame Street show and spaghetti ride/001 the awesome Transformers ride/001 the Mummy ride/001 the rollercoaster/001 the water fountain park in Jurassic Park. The choice of food was actually really good for a fun park/001 and you can get a beer if you want.We will be back.

Recommend staying in a close hotel/001 so when queues really long had a relax at our hotel 3-5.00pm. Went back and the lines so much shorter/001 stayed doing roller coasters until 7.00pm close.

This thrilled my 7 year old son!Tip for buying your tickets... Head into China Town to the Peoples Palace Shopping mall (Big Old Green Building) head upstairs to the travel agencies and buy your tickets through them. It'll cost a lot less than buying at the gate. Just check for online deals first to give some slight negotiating power!Just beware/001 when you're in the park expect to pay close to four times the price for food and drinks as you would elsewhere in Singapore/001 It is after all on Sentosa!

We have already been to Universal Studios in Los Angeles and Orlando. Although not quite as big/001 there was still plenty to do in 2 days. We took someone's advice from Trip Advisor and bought the 6 month pass with fast entry also. It is cheaper than buying 2 separate one day passes (there are no 2 days passes - only one day and then 6 months). We also got 10% discount on all F&B in Universal plus on any other purchases. It was worth paying for the fast pass otherwise the most popular rides you could be waiting for up to one hour to get on. We only had to wait a maximum of 5 minutes! I highly recommend Universal Studios/001 Singapore as a a great theme park that is well run.

Keep track of the different shows/events which happens in different places inside USS. Better to start at 10 am so that you have little less crowd. One major sour about the place was no options of Vegetarian food at all. We hardly found one place selling Veggie food. Probably something for the management to look out for.

We were able to ride all the man attractions except for the Jurassic park rapids adventure. Made the mistake of reserving it for last and had to wait for an hour.

You can expect to pay around 75 Sg Dollars on the day although we managed to get them for 60 beforehand. Shop around for the best price. There are other attractions on Sentosa Island but Universal is probably the most popular for tourists.

My tip would be to only use the express pass if the wait for a ride is 10+minutes. Otherwise just line up and use the express pass later in the day when you want to go on the ride for a second time. That's what we did and it meant that we got to go on every ride twice without lining up.My second tip is to make sure you do the Cyclon rollercoaster first (it's the most extreme ride in the park) because the lines are huge later in the day. Even if you have the express pass it is still a 45min wait.Drink plenty of water as some of the lines get really hot and don't wear loose shoes because they make you take them off for some of the rides.

Great place for kids and even adults. A Lot to do to keep you entertained for hours. Transformers 4d show was really good and good to go in although everyone runs to the roller coasters first up so I worked my way round clockwise and pretty much had no queuing time for anything until the roller coasters.

Rajeswar V,None,22 April 2017,Amazing Experience!!! ,5,F8FED61DC674A3E16D506C19A99A74E3,"Keep one full day if not 2 to cover the whole Sentosa Island. Universal studios have some normal rides and some fantastic shows and rides.. don't miss Tranformers experience and water world show. Depending on the rush at that point of time/001 it is advisable to take premium pass .. advantage of this pass is not only it saves time at long queues/001 one can go for repeat rides and shows using this as many times as you want. We enjoyed repeat for Transformers ride as we liked it a lot and also to some other rides depending on kids demands. :) Lots of eateries available and so food is not a problem . People with big pockets can even venture to the casino. Overall/001 it was just awesome time spent there.

DaBene,Jakarta- Indonesia,22 April 2017,Good rides but bad service and infrastructure,3,81D98937E4B0679C52EBD274082B912F,"Went there on a weekday.About 200+ people were queuing for 30 minutes at the ticket counter as only two booths (four clerks) were open. Request to open further booths was left unanswered.Note: You will save a lot of time if you buy the express pass (but beware it does not apply to all attractions)Rides were fun. Especially Mummy/001 Galaktika and Transformers. Waterworld show was cancelled as it started to rain (given high ticket prices something that park management definitely want to fix by either offering a discount or voucher or by modifying infrastructure).It was also the rain that highlighted the park's major shortcoming. Once it starts/001 you are stuck wherever you are. No transport/001 no covered walkways. Only option is to buy a S$ 39 umbrella (!) or a S$ 5 cape both of which will leave your lower body exposed while wading through the elements.You will find many food choices. Qualitatively/001 none rise above average (except for price tags which approach the zone of usury).Better management and customer focus would make this a fun experience.

And no Minions either.

Ray A,None,22 April 2017,One of the best places in Singapore in my opinion,5,586897B44527808ECC562CE3AAC1DE40,"Well worth the money. You can go into the rides as many times as you want/001 and I took advantage of it. The transformer ride is FANTASTIC. The Cylon rollercoaster too/001 very scary. Then there's the mummy rollercoaster. This one was even scarier to me because it was DESIGNED to be scary! Jumpscares/001 steep falls/001 and unlike other rollercoasters/001 you can't even see what's going to happen! The place is very well themed too. There was this one place that was themed after how western countries looked like a few centuries ago/001 and they nailed it. It looked as if we actually traveled through time. The only thing missing were a few people in coats and suites with a smoking pipe in their mouths. Fantastic.If you've got a free day/001 then I'd recommend you to come here. You will not regret it.

But one ride had delays to begin with which I can understand happens even the second ride having delays in the same day its kinda just bad luck but still annoying. Then when you go to get your stuff out of locker knowing you need to take cards and doesnt have to be cash you would expect it to work. Well it doesnt/001 had to rush around at closing time finding atm to get cash out and employee we approached for help had no idea what we were on about.

Adrian S,Colombo- Sri Lanka,21 April 2017,The best theme park in South Asia!,5,809A0B9C4E2498C83B6920A7195A2731,"Universal Studios Singapore offers pretty much your childhood fantasises coming true. All the rides are thrilling and you can take your kids to most of them. You can even buy food and souvenirs from Universal Studios - quite expensive though!I would recommend you to buy a no queue pass/ fast lane ticket so that you can go to the rides asap. Otherwise you'll just be standing in the queues and will not be able to go on a ride.

Corinne S,Battaramulla- Sri Lanka,21 April 2017,Wonderful Attraction!,5,13F1F8DFBB2E2FC49DB8182C2F43468A,"This was the first attraction that me and my family (3 of us) visited. We booked through the hotel (Mandarin Orchard) which cost us S$74 per person without transfers. When we got there it was noon and we were in time to see the Sesame Street Live show. It was great. Even we adults enjoyed it. Thereafter we went on the rides. The battle starts Galactica roller coaster was awesome. But to get to it there was a very long queue and we would have had to wait closer upon an hour. It was a holiday the day we went. However/001 I suggest that you take the express ticket so that you could enjoy all the attractions within Universal Studios and get there in the morning. By waiting in the queue/001 we missed quite a few. The other rides we went on were the canopy flyer/001 Madagascar: a crate adventure (it was fun) and Jurassic Park Rapids. The Lost World rock climb too was fantastic/001 if you manage to make it to the top. Overall it was a fantastic day and we enjoyed it thoroughly.

My favorites were the Galatica transformers roller coster/001 the 7D rides/001 the Mummy returns/001 the dance performances/001 the crackers blasted at the end etc. It is a great place for kids above 4-5 yrs as well!!The only concern is the long queues unless you can afford the VIP pass. Another couple of Tips would be to not do the Universal Studios and Sentosa Island in 1 day/001 it's impossible. Also/001 do not buy the magnets from here/001 as you would get the same and cooler ones at the $1 Market!!

I must say that I enjoyed The Mummy/001 Transformers/001 Battlestar Galactica/001 a must ride for adults. I tried exchanging my local currency to Sgd and rates are way higher when you do it there.

Pre-printed ticket bought online from main website/001 easy access... made a bee line for the Transformers ride no queue then onto Mummy Ride (not for the faint hearted extreme roller coaster in the dark) and then Jurassic Ride which was my children's favourite (aged 10 & 8). The Jurassic section doesn't open until 11.00am but we were there at the opening and managed to get on the ride straight away. After that we cruised through the other lands 4D Shrek show was great. Food wasn't great but not allowed to take in food or drink. Husband enjoyed the fruit cup. They have water stations/fans everywhere including in the waiting line for rides. Overall a fun day out with the kids/001 were done by 2.00pm. We then visited Candylicious outside of Universal for an ice cream. Then onto Trick Eye Museum... was quiet at the beginning however near the end was hectic with lots of people entering after leaving Universal I'm guessing. Made it hard to take some good photos. Kids loved Trick Eye.

Luckily there are still some really enjoyable rides/001 great opportunities to meet characters and do all the fun things that is a day out a an amusement park.The food in the park is lacking/001 not many options and the options are not well presented or particularly good quality. It is very hard to get anything which could pass as healthy which doesn't look 'sad'.It is very easy to do this park in a day and I would strongly suggest getting the fast pass as it means that you can avoid waiting and leave the park on a high without ever having to wait more than maybe 15mins at the peak times if you go on a week day that is not a school holiday.

You can buy discounted tickets through travel websites like GoVoyagin/001 there are special bundle ticket options available to visit multiple attractions on Sentosa & maximise your fun; this visit we purchased a double for Universal Studios & S.E.A. Aquarium. The entrances are directly across from one another/001 both are awesome attractions & there is something for everyone. The instructions to redeem the tickets on the confirmation email were perfect/001 but when we tried to print our passes at the Universal Studios self help kiosk the printers weren't working so to avoid that I recommend going directly to Guest Services (which for USS is hidden directly behind the yellow ticket boxes where general public line up) and they will print your tickets for you and all is good. Pass outs are available any time the attractions are open/001 so what we do if the heat & the wait lines to go on rides becomes too much/001 is escape to the Aquarium & into the air con to wind down & enjoy watching the marine life in the huge aquarium. I recommend for Universal Studios to either turn up right on 10am/001 or wait until after 1pm (which still gives you 6 hours) if you want to avoid long wait lines. Anyway this bundle is great value for money/001 we searched for many offers and this one was good value/001 easy and undeniably the best combo pick for Sentosa.Also/001 check the website for any ride closures. And if you want to save cash on the food offerings at USS/001 there are cheaper food outlets like macdonalds/001 texas chicken & many different asian diners & restaurants outside the park in rwsentosa.

Best advice I can give is to get an unlimited front of line pass. Although this may cost a bit more/001 it is well worth it/001 as you will not be in lines for hours ( yes in busy times it can be that long) and there are many rides you will want to take over and over again. I found the 3D Transformers ride to be the best I have ever experienced. The Jurassic Park ride was great to cool down ( you will get very wet lol) and the Mummy was yet another scary one.There are plenty of places to sit and rest/001 plenty of eateries of differing types/001 huge amounts of merchandise at good prices ( not too expensive) and lots of etertainment around the place.

If you do not do that or it is weekend/001 take the express pass option (30 dollars single turn/001 50 dollars unlimited). Queues will ruin your day.

We did not purchase a fast-pass and only endured long waits for the Enchanted Airways junior roller coaster (not worth it for the short ride) and Jurassic Park Rapids (worth it- the line moves quicker than you would expect and no/001 you don't need to invest in a rain poncho). If you are one of the first to exit the Shrek 4D experience then you may not have to wait in line for the Magic Potion Ferris wheel ride inside the store. Everyone's favorite ride (5y-43y) was Transformers. Revenge of the Mummy is not for the faint of heart. The Sesame Spaghetti Space Chase was a cutest ride. Starbot cafe was the coolest restaurant and was the best place to enjoy molecular ice-cream. This was easily done in a day/001 probably half-day if investing in a fast-pass.

Not ideal but okay. After that a lot of the bigger rides had a 25-35 min wait so we started looking at express pass/001 but after seeing in a tripadvisor post that it was 60 dollars pp we decided to rather try ""single rider"" option and boy was this a game changer!! Went on about 4 rides single rider style. So you don't get to sit with your friend/wife/family/001 BUT we waited on average 5 min when the lines were often 30 or even 40 min long. GAME CHANGER as long as you dont have young kids.

However/001 the staff really let us down and ruined what would have been a wonderful day.Upon entering/001 staff approached us to inform us about an Easter promotion where to win/001 guests had to look out for staff wearing a special badge. We found one of those staff who congratulated us on being the first to win a chocolate hamper and to post a photo on Facebook in order to collect the prize. After doing that/001 we went to collect the prize but the staff there told us there was no chocolate at all and just a key ring. This was disappointing but not a big deal. The real problem was how we were treated - the staff laughed at us as if we were stupid for even asking about chocolate. So we went back to the staff at the entrance who originally told us about the promotion to ask for clarification on the prizes/001 and their answers went from ""I don't know"" to ""there is supposed to be chocolate"" - they couldn't give a simple yes or no answer. So then we then went to Guest Services to complain about how unclear this promotion was. We were served by Miki/001 who when we explained what had happened/001 she openly laughed as us to our faces. It was only after we said we were insulted by her laughing at us that she made up some excuse saying the promotion was somehow funny and that she wasn't laughing at us. She also had no idea about this promotion and admitted it was the park's problem for not properly briefing staff. Although disappointing not to win anything/001 the issue we had was with the staff. They had a really bad attitude- laughing at guests/001 not offering any kind of problem resolution or even a simple apology for how we were treated. Miki then confirmed that all we could do was fill in a complaint form and that the park nor the Genting group would do anything. It really gave us the impression that they just don't care about their guests.I would still recommend visiting Universal Studios as it is a fun day out but I would strongly advise not to bother speaking to staff about any kind of promotion as they have no clue as to what's going on/001 and rather than trying to help/001 they just laugh at you. It would be great if management at Universal Studios could provide training for staff on how to properly handle complaints rather than treating their guests like idiots.

Watching the express people walk right past you while you have been waiting in the line for 45 minutes/001 really isn't fun. Whether it be weekend or weekday/001 your experience will be much better if you have the express pass. In saying this/001 the longest we had to go on the Transformers ride which was about an hour which isn't too long in the scheme of things. Definitely recommend the Cylon and Revenge of the Mummy. Lockers are free for 45 minutes and then you pay $2 for every 20 minutes. So sucks if you have waited in a line and you get charged. Therefore you should carry some money on you just in case it was to happen. Food is a little pricey/001 western and traditional options available. Overall really fun day/001 would do it again!

With 3D and 4D they were fantastic. Our tip for anyone going who can afford it /001 buy an express ticket when you get there. My husband doesn't queue for anything and with the express ticket the maximum waiting time was about 10-15 minutes. The wait time on the boards were from 30-50 minutes.

Must try the caramel popcorn $8 yummy and the $4 corn dogs best I've tasted/001 otherwise food prices/gift shop similar to Australia . Also if you get a 6month pass you get 10 percent off anything bought in Universal studios/001 or use your MasterCard (we are using nab travel card no fees great check it out) I think the lady said over $50 also a 10 percent off!

And I must say each time I was so impressed.Some tricks you may wanna consider before going:Go on weekdays. Weekends are hell crowded and the queue time is about 120 min for each ride especially in the morning. You can simply buy the express pass/001 still facing lines but shorter.Be there at 10 AM to get the most out of it.Plan your day ahead/001 prioritize the rides you want to do the most as you will have short of time. My suggestions are Transformers/001 roller coaster (Cylon and Human)/001 Revenge of the Mummy/001 Jurassic Park Rapids adventure. You can simply forget about Madagascar and Shrek 4D if you do not have enough time. But if you looking for something a bit relaxing/001 go for them.There are several shows during the day/001 not all are good but worth watching if you have time.The queues will be shorter in the evening. We got the chance to ride Cylon 3 times and Revenge of the Mummy 2. Food is of ver low quality and pricey! (I am not sure if eating will be a good idea at all before riding the high-speed rides!) Anyhow/001 that is the only thing you get to eat there. You can take some chocolate or granola bars or try some ice cream there (Ben & Jerry`s at Far Far Away) and then later eat dinner in Sentosa. (Chillis restaurant and some local food nearby). All the rides will be closed at 7 PM.Enjoy and have lots of fun.

The park itself is surprisingly small and most of the themed lands merge in to one another. The ride selection was okay for a thrill seeker/001 but might be less so for young families. Most of the rides during our visit were open with the odd ride down for renovations which is completely understandable. One thing that was really noticeable though/001 especially when comparing the park to its US equivalents was that the park was poorly maintained. Most of the rides paint jobs were flaky and the theming and props looked like they had been through a hurricane. I really wasn't expecting this from such a new park and for me/001 it really showed the low level of commitment to maintain elements when comparing it to a Disney theme park.Would I come here again? Probably not. But if you're not really fussed about how a park is kept/001 and want a small handful of thrilling rides/001 go for it.

ankeet_sinha,Nairobi- Kenya,7 April 2017,Underwhelming but express pass is a must,4,E4DF5E77910752ED812205020AC79581,"I have been to Disneyland Paris and now Universal Studios Singapore and must say it pales in comparison to Disneyland Paris. Not much to do if you are with young kids but it is not a bad place by any means.Couple of things - Get lots of water as I had heard you get water but not once did I find a spot. We bought a long sipper due to which we could get an liquid refilled at no charge as long as we had that sipper. Also/001 get a hat and raincoat since the weather is fickle. Also please get an express pass as it will save loads of time and enable you to do most rides. Since we had planned to go to the SEA aquarium/001 we left at 3 pm from there otherwise we would have done all rides. You also have the option of re entry on the same day as they stamp you before you leave. You also get baby prams on rent for SGD 15 which is a bit steep but it serves the purpose.The gift shop at the start is also quite decent/001 not as many options as Disney but you can get lot of stuff nevertheless. You can buy and they give you the option of picking it from a drop off point so use that option to avoid carrying luggage.Now for the park - it is shaped like a big circle. You can start from the left which is Madagascar and take the water ride as well as get yourself clicked with the cast of Madagascar and do the merry go round if you have a child (this is something which was easier to do as compared with Disney). Then you go to Far Far Away or the land of Shrek where you can do the Shrek 4D ride and the Puss in Boots Adventure Ride. While the Shrek 4D takes almsot an hour/001 it is not as impressive so avoid if you are short on time. Do the Puss in Boots ride though as it is different and quite good.Then move to Jurassic park for the roundabouts/001 the water adventure and the roller coaster - all of which are good. After that you go to the land of Pharaohs/001 Egypt which has a roller coaster and an adventure ride.The to the transformer section where you can do the really scary roller coaster and the Transformers 7D ride which is basically the best ride in the park. This is a must. Avoid getting clicked by the photographers who charge a bomb for their photos but if you must then there is a parade at 3 pm which is in the Sesame street section which is after the transformers section and there you can get yourself clicked and later on printed as well. The Sesame Street portion has diners and is covered with a skylight so you can relax there.A suggestion here is that get the map via google/001 explore all rides on youtube and then see which ones you want to do and do them first when you get there This will save time alongwith the Express pass which reduces waiting time by 30 mins. Beware though that some rides are not covered under express pass so waiting is a must for them.Have fun but if you have been to Disneyland Paris then dont expect it to be at the same level.

mimipie2015,Sydney- Australia,6 April 2017,GOOD family fun!,4,E9735DDE69BD031E73D6236F96C1C6FB,"Our young family enjoyed the studios a lot. It's such an easy trip from the city ($12 cab) Here are a few tips. Midweek crowds are much more manageable. Try to avoid the weekend crush. The express pass is a MUST with young kids. Even on a moderately busy day/001 the queues were from 30mins to 1.5hrs for the Transformers ride (which was excellent). The pass is not cheap/001 but it allows you to bypass the queues almost entirely. In the hot weather/001 this makes a huge difference to the day's enjoyment. We managed to go on all the rides we wanted (12 of them) and left with smiles. The pass is cheaper off-peak (early in morning/001 or after lunch) and can be bought in many places around the park. Bring spare clothes for little ones (some rides are wet/001 and there is a small water fountain play area). You can fill up water bottles around the place. The locker system is an annoyance for some of the larger roller coasters. You have to check your bags before you ride. On busy days there is a locker queue. It's free for 2.5 hours so it might be an idea to check your bags and do the two largest rollercoasters first (Sci Fi world and Mummy World).

tjjohn,Meerut,5 April 2017,Interesting disorganized and an over crowded adventure park,3,EA8271F8B12372C87BFE650BE4AD3B56,"The park has interesting themes and exciting rides but the surging crowds was a put off. We spent about five hours here and could do just three events that lasted a total time of about 30 Mins.The rest was spent on standing in a queue awaiting our turn and searching for items of interest and eating in a restaurant. The Jurassic park theme was pretty good but the ride lasted just 6 minutes after a wait period of about 50 plus minutes. Madagascar also was good but fortunately the wait period was shorter. The question of whether the visit is worth the price is difficult to answer. All the themes are good. There are some that interests kids and some for teens and others for adults. Re- organizing the park with detailed information on the various themes and some brief summary of what can be seen or experienced plus a map of the park with directions and sign boards etc. and instructions would go a long way to help visitors to manage their time in the best possible manner inside the park/001 If these are already available they are obviously not available to every one. I was searching for the official website of Universal Studios for such information but could not find one. I could get only information provided by third party tour operators for this attraction.Paying extra for an express ticket to jump the queue was an option I was not very keen on. One jumps the queue encroaching the time from the standard ticket holder's time there by raising his/her time in the queue.An absorbing subject for a debate in ethics.

My recomendation is not to skip WaterWorld and Transformers. Quality of the food could and should be better. Maybe is ok for asian people/001 but for me who don't like asian food so much it is not good. I refuse to eat and wait to go outside to find some good place to eat. Ah/001 almost forget.

Melb0urne13,Melbourne- Australia,3 April 2017,Worth the experience,3,01735D6AF52F93FD78FDCB230C4FAF1D,"Spent the day at Universal and was put off straight away once we entered and went to go on the first ride/001 the guy at the entrance indicated that unsecured items should be put into lockers that were provided (which is fair enough)/001 however every locker we went to store our goods were sold out/001 we then had to find someone that represented the park to give us direction (good luck with that)/001 we eventually found two gents who were more than happy to help/001 they suggested to go back out and use the lockers situated just outside of the entrance/001 we found the lockers/001 then had trouble with inserting cash (again no one around to assist)/001 eventually had success on the last go/001 with all this we had missed an hour and a half/001 not to mention lining up at the que to get in again/001 by the way it costs 15 dollars for a small locker outside of the park opposed to 20 dollars max inside of the park. After the initial frustrating moments we went on the first ride (battle star Galactica) which took nearly 2 hours to get through/001 I did put this down to the lack of organisation when we eventually reached the ride/001 there was way too much delay in getting people off and on (the rest of the rides were super organised)/001 I understand the safety component/001 however this was due/001 in my opinion/001 poor team work (besides the ride was average). after this ride we went nearly all the major rides (I think a few people have mentioned after lunch)/001 which did not take over 30 minutes to get on (transformers 15 mins after lunch)/001 and found the organisation between these teams excellent. We have been to Universal in LA/001Knotsberry Farm in Anaheim/001 Movie world and Dreamword/001 in Queensland/001 although you can not compare these to Singapore (which is overall expensive)/001 although comparing prices for entry and food/001 fairly much the same across the board. As we were first timers here/001 I would suggest cater for the whole day here and don't forget to get your tickets from the MRT for 4 dollars each return/001 this is situated on the third floor of the Vivo centre.

The same attractions that are there year after year. Universal might consider changing out some of the rids and attractions with something new. With all of that said.

A clean and well maintained place. One thing to definitely not miss would be Steven Spielberg Lights Camera Action section where they show you a glimpse of sound and special effects. All the other rides are good. Though the rates are on a little higher side but worth it. Please reach the venue on time so that you can cover the entire thing in a day.

Clean and helpful staff with great sets that will amaze you. Some tips for a great day:1. Start early when its less crowded.2. Buy a priority pass (SD$30.00) but it believe me its the difference between 5 mins and sometimes 50mis in a queue. This is a must during school holidays or weekends.3. Not much dining options mostly fried food. But you can get pass-outs to eat in Sentosa and then go back inside.4. Do the Jurrasic Ride as one of your last ones because you can get pretty wet (especially your shoes)5. Wear comfortable shoes.6. Do the Water World show /001 Check the times that its on and dont miss out.7. People will try to cut the line/001 just be assertive and polite in addressing this and if they succeed in forcing their way/001 don't let it ruin your day (but you shouldn't get this problem if you get a priority pass).

Helmi A,None,1 April 2017,Not worth the money!!!!,1,5ED61F412131084230670B7F9CD2A43E,"Very expensive attraction. Beverages and souvenir very expensive. Very boring rides. Very very very long queue. This theme park is more concern about making a snake like queues. Never ending qieues. Long queues will make all the guest felt tired and also felt like giving up of coming to the USS AGAIN. Queue for nearly 1 bour while the rides only last for as long as 2 min. So dissappointing and miserable theme park ever.USS management should limit the number of guest coming to USS to avoid dissappointment among the guests. USS management also should not just think of making money for their own interest without thinking of the guests feeling. This will be my first and last trip to USS. Those guest who read this might want to think twice before coming here.

They only have battlestar galactica and mummy revenge for thriller seeker/001 I even can said both is not really scary.. you will see a lot of children (about 7 years old) go to this ride/001 it means that it is not too scary for kids. Another good attraction is transformer/001 but that's awesome because of the technology/001 good but not scary at all.. another attraction is just like a kid's toys or modern doll house. Nice/001 but not for a thriller seeker. You also should be patient in facing unfriendly staff. Most of them is really annoying/001 their expression shows if they are too tired and always tell everything in a hurry. Not recommended for thriller seeker/001 but recommended for family and adult who loves relaxing attraction.. hope they will build another serious thrilling attraction for adult and teach their staff to be more friendly.

Return vis the MRT Train system costing £3.50 for us both. That was to Orchard Road City Centre (Holiday Inn) . See separate review for that. If you made your own way to the park on the underground system the park entrance is only £33 each plus of course the £1.75 each train fare.This is a very small park in comparison to the USA/001 but still worth the entrance fee.Really easy to navigate round the park/001 you can go left or right on entry and the park is roughly in a circle.On average two rides per area and there are 6 areas to exploreThere are 4 thrill rides/001 one water rapid ride ( you will get wet/001 even soaked) The rest of the rides I would describe as family friendly.Other than the rides must do's are Shrek 4D Adventure and Waterworld Live stunt show ( a must see )Plenty of eateries/001 including ice cream stands catering for all tastes and dietary requirements. Cost of eating and drinking quite reasonable even though you are a captive audience.

On this occasion I was bringing my 10yo who has no memory of visiting a decent theme park (including her first birthday spent at Disneyland in Anaheim). I know this is one of the smaller Universal parks so I was focussed on having my daughter just enjoy whatever was on offer given she really had nothing to compare it to. However I found this park to be better than my expectations and it definitely delivered for my 10yo who went from being terrified of roller coasters to a hardcore lover of them in only one day at Universal Studios Singapore. Favourites were definitely Revenge of the Mummy/001 Transformers and Battlestar Galactica (both sides) - and the Rapids ride in Jurassic Park was a great way to warm up to the more thrilling stuff and to cool off in the tropical heat simultaneously. Great atmosphere/001 fairly decent food and good staff made for a very memorable day for us. Would definitely visit again.

We notice that the entrance fee and the Priority Pass had all gone up in price. The Priority pass is now $50SG each. We still purchased them .On entering the park we went on our favourite ride /001 Madagascar . love this ride /001 so much fun. We then began working our way around the park and discovered something. Not all the rides have priority pass . In fact 4 of our favourite attractions did not let us have priority . If we had been told this we would not have bought them .

If you want to try the Water World I suggest if you don't have raincoat with you don't seat near the performance area coz you might be wet . Can't open umbrella and you cannot move to your seat once show started. It's a entertainment were have actors perform a story. Have lots of rides to try too. You should save energy before go here in Universal to make sure you can try all. They open at 10AM and close I think till around 1900. Better you eat first before go here coz food inside is kinda more expensive. Place is actullay not so huge but if have many people you need to spend more time waiting in the line. For us we started at 1300 then finished at 1700. So halfday will be fine I think.

Its a must ride for me for Transformer ride/001 mummy roller coaster/001 rapid adventure boat ride/001 flying canopy/001 puss in boots mini rollercoaster. Its a must watch for the waterworld show and Sherk 4D show. The rest of the attraction can take it if you have the time. I will always go for the shortest waiting time first as the queuing time will change sometimes will be shorter half hour later. But usually after 6pm/001 most of the attraction will have lesser people queuing as most of them went home already.

It's great for young children or as a first theme park experience. For older kids wanting a lot of fast roller coasters/001 it might be disappointing. Our five year old could do almost everything. Our three year old could do enough. We visited midweek and there were very short lines/001 normally 5 or 10 minutes if we couldn't walk right on. The longest we waited was 30 minutes for Transformers. We considered the fast passes but I'm so glad we didn't pay the extra money. No need. Crowds were very manageable. Much of the park is covered so you aren't in the hot sun too much. I had never seen that at another theme park. It was great!Expect your typical overpriced theme park food and souvenirs.

ZzZ_Clye,None,15 March 2017,Well Planned Route Helped!,4,C68207EF57D21449599810C20C6114A0,"Went there during CNY (I know!) I thought I was setting myself (and my husband) up for disaster but it turned out better than I expected! We did exactly what was recommended online. Go to the popular rides first/001 eat lunch early (at 12noon) and take note the show time so that we won't miss anything. We ended up riding all the popular rides more than once/001 some thrice! (No Express Pass required) We had lots of extra time taking pictures and even try some of the children rides (:D). However/001 I would like to add a few things. It is great to wear shorts with zippers so that you can keep some of your paper money with you when going for rides especially those don't allow you to bring anything with ya and asked you to lock it in the locker. The queue wasn't taking too long just we were lost track of the time and then we were stranded because we over the 40mins free period (we were there 42mins mark - serious!) and need to pay 2$ before can collect our stuff. Our wallets were inside the locker. Luckily I manage to borrow some from a kind couple that just walked in to put their stuff inside the locker. Or better still load your EzLink card with some money on it and just carry it around inside your zipper pocket :D No coins because the staffs will buzz you out from the queue. We brought our own raincoat/001 one that provides good protection but thin. Because what they sell inside the themepark really do nothing for you. We even get to enjoy the Water World Show right at the wet area without being (soaking) wet! Don't go for Cylon and Human first if you are there early in the morning right when the themepark open. Why? Because that early/001 they are not running at full capacity. So eventho the lines aren't long but it will take double the time to clear. That's what happened to us..so after the Human ride/001 we went to another one then came back for Cylon when it is running at full capacity. We had a great time!

We visited the park on October 10/001 2016.We booked our tickets online on the Sentosa site and received a discount + a free water bottle (with the head of the Indominus-Rex from Jurassic World). I would recommend the online reservation because you won't have to spend a ton buying water bottles within the park/001 and the refills are not as expensive as filling up once.We entered the park around at 10 am/001 and Beetlejuice was standing near the entrance. We went on the Jurassic Park River Rapids ride first/001 and then went on The Mummy. The later's queue was around 45 minutes the first time we rode it/001 but we didn't get bored. There is music and sound effects along the way/001 and plenty to look at.We had lunch at the Discovery Center in Jurassic Park - wet noodles with vegetables. Four of us shared three plates as the quantity is pretty big and it's a little expensive. So this is a good option for vegans. The ambiance in the place was of course great.I emailed the company before-hand about options and they also suggested the Oasis Space Cafe. Their Indian option with chana masala/001 rice and papadums is vegan. Being Indian/001 we didn't want to have Indian food even on vacation (: Via email/001 they also said they could customize a pizza without cheese or dairy products. So make sure to contact them in advance if you have any special dietary needs.After lunch/001 we made our way towards the junction where Jurassic Park/001 Water World and Far Far Away meet/001 and got to see the raptor show. Took a bunch of pictures and successfully answered that Bubbles was a velociraptor (yay dinosaur-loving me!) We rode The Mummy again around at 3 pm and the wait time was only 10 minutes (yay!) We also walked around and discovered other places like the Canopy Flyer. If you walk a little further inside/001 you will see nice picture areas with a T-Rex fossil head and broken dinosaur eggs that you can sit in.Unfortunately we couldn't meet any of the Sesame Street characters. When we got to the designated area/001 they were leaving to take a break/001 and when we came back they still hadn't returned.Before leaving/001 we rode Madagascar A Crate Adventure/001 King Julien's Beach Party-Go-Round/001 Spaghetti Space Chase/001 Accelerator/001 Lights/001 Camera/001 Action/001 and Shrek 4-D Adventure.Our favorites were definitely Jurassic Park Rapids/001 The Mummy and Canopy Flyer.The park is small and the day we went/001 the crowd wasn't too big. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Everyone who worked there was always smiling. Would definitely visit again/001 thanks for the memories and the experience Universal Studios!

It is not well sign posted and we had no idea how far it was from the transport. There is a lot on this Island and Universal appears tucked away in a corner. Once there it is a great place/001 first of all we received the Seniors Discount (it doesn't matter which country you are from - if you are over 60 you can get in at the Seniors Rate - just let them know when buying your ticket).

We both have young kids (5 year old and 1 year old). But/001 that did not limit us from having all the fun! There are loads of things to do at Universal Studios for everyone. My Son (5 year old) had lots of fun at the Puss in Boots/001 Far Far Away from Shrek series/001 Madagascar themed ride/001 Transformers/001 etc. We had a great time riding on Battle Star Galactica! It's a great experience. Don't miss that. If you can go there on a weekday around 11/001 you can pretty much cover everything without buying an add-on express ticket. But if you are not so lucky/001 then better to buy an express ticket! This allows you to skip the queue for lost of the rides! Don't miss the Ancient Egypt and the Lost World attractions. If you are not too fussy about drinking water/001 try to carry an empty bottle so you can fill it up at various water stations inside! Food is expensive inside the studio/001 but you can always have god at the Malaysian Food court just outside Universal Studio. If you are lucky and it doesn't rain/001 you will have lots of fun!

Plus you can bring home a 6R sized photo for free! Such a good deal! We were not able to try all the rides due to limited time we reached the park before lunch and went out exactly at the park's closing time. It was a tiring but fun day! I'll definitely come back here to try the other rides that I was not able to try. The best ride I tried was Transformers and Battlestar Galactica-Human. Worth all the wait! And oh if you don't want to wait too long for Battlestar galactica ride one tip i can give is try riding it before the park close no lines and whatsoever! Haha!I'm just sad that I was not able to take photos with the characters especially Minions because they only come out for a couple of mins and they won't allow you to line up if its past the given time. Boo!!! Longer time pls. And oh fireworks! Make it everyday instead of just weekends and holidays pls! Went shopping at the USS store for souvenirs I got lucky somehow cause there are shirts that were on sale on the day we came so I was able to get shirts for the whole family! Yay!

Despite him having a flu/001 he had plenty of fun in uss. My boy is a real animal cartoon fan/001 so the madagascar rides were his personal favourites. Luckily he's seen the shrek movie before we came here too. He loved the shrek dungeon cinema thingy too. Although the queue was long and the briefing took a while/001 it was all worth it. The water effects from the donkey sneeze & other scenes was a major talking point for him all the way back to the hotel. So we knew that the short movie screening was memorable and enjoyable for him. We/001 the parents could not go for the sci fi rollercoaster rides becoz it was just the 3 of us and my toddler was ineligible for then. One of us had to take care of the child/001 so it would be less enjoyable to experience it alone. The people we saw who took them seems to have had a really good time. Who knows/001 maybe we'll be back again when he's grown up to enjoy the rides we couldn't take this time around. Plenty of retail shops and eateries in here too. A great many options from the themed shops all the way to the main one at the entrance. Goods and merchandise cane with plenty of variety and it would be a challenge for anyone coming out of those shops empty handed what with the great many varieties you guys have on offer. Another thing to mention is the appearances by characters which are lively and well scheduled out thruout the day. We had bucketloads of fun with the penguins and other madagascar characters. Special mention to the big guy who hosted the madagascar dance thingy. He is lively & friendly. Thank you to the whole uss team/001 i feel that you guys set the benchmark for a well organised theme park within our region which other similar parks can try match or gauge their own standards.

Getting to the park is relatively easy/001 by taking either the Sentosa Express or cable cars to Sentosa/001 which are close to MRT network.If visiting as a couple with the other half not too interested in the 'big' rides/001 this saves you a lot of time/001 particularly as the 'big' rides (the rollercoasters/001 basically) allow single riders. This saves a lot of time/001 particularly as during peak times these rides have waiting times varying for between the 45 and 90 minutes. I would recommend going on the 'big' rides in the first hour or two of opening/001 as you will be disappointed otherwise. You can buy a pass which allows you express entry onto these rides/001 but this costs about $60 extra/001 so can result in an expensive day out.Even a few of the family friendly rides are worth a go/001 even if you don't have kids with you (Puss in Boots and Sesame Street). We queued over an hour for the Madagascar ride/001 and to be fair/001 this is pretty average and wouldn't recommend doing so.

DA Paloma P,Fuente de Piedra- Andalucia- Spain,4 March 2017,Mastercard Promotional is Love 😍,1,FC35A94F560C0A2337E77467E0CE90C7,"Purchased ticket weeks before our trip and we discounted huge. Also/001 we love the freebies that came with it.We went on a weekend which explains the long queue but we got to see the parade which is a plus!Not advisable for hot summer days given Singapore's humid weather.The staff at the gate was rude. We went out to exchange our $$ at the money exchange right outside the gate and we were stamped with ""invisible"" mark for returning in.When we got back after exchanging currencies/001 she would not let us in. I do not know if that was trickery of some sort to have less people at the park. We asked her what was the ""invisible"" stamp for if she would not have a way to trace if we were really returning or just trying to sneak. I used to think of theme parks as happy places in Earth. Bad memory of a theme park which ruined how I view places as such.

My 4 year old enjoyed herself at this place.I do not feel an express pass is necessary but I appreciate that it can save you a lot of hassle esp for families with lots of young kids.Park well run and queues moved swiftly. Fans were plenty along queue lines. Opportunities for snacks and water were plenty. Rides were good even for scaredy cats like me. If one was looking for wilder/higher rides/001 this park may not be it.Please ensure that sun protection advice are followed as it can get very hot esp between 10am til 5pm. Wear hats and spf creams and drink plenty of water. Try walking in the shade if you can. Queue lines will be shaded but not much shaded walkways when walking around park.

Filip_Paseka,Ho Chi Minh City- Vietnam,4 March 2017,Good park,4,271B0DC7E0CE54E05F86E603E1CFEB00,"We spent in the studio whole day and tried almost every single attraction/001 staff was very friendly and smiling whole day.We would recommend to not miss Mummy area/001 of course sci-fi attractions and despite the fact we are not fans of transformers/001 3D drive there was simply the best.Unfortunately (big BUT)/001 you can buy express pass which allows you to go to the special queue and you skip the line. At some attractions there were so many people with this pass that even they made queue and waiting time for normal people was incredibly long. We absolutely not agree with this mechanism and in our opinion it is not way which park should go. It is only making people mad and angry.Another point is that in Jurassic park you need to pay for locker (longer you use it/001 more money you pay)/001 and together with many people with express pass you are just paying more for locker because they are skipping the queue (you wait more/001 pay more).If you would like to eat something/001 we definitely recommend Mel's bistro - great atmosphere with nice double burger.

Very thoughtfully designed theme park with well managed facilities. It was our lucky day that the weather was clear and each and every ride was operational/001 though we waited long in the ques it took almost 2 hours in few rides. But the rides in the park are exciting/001 Mummy Ride and Galactic are the best rides. I personally liked the Transformers Ride and the Shrek Show. Lots of food options/001 but little expensive/001 you can also carry your meal box. There are few shops just to take some memorable gifts and many attractive places to take superb pictures.

SBPerth,Perth- Australia,3 March 2017,Highlight of our Singapore Trip,5,98A603A5B53F6FE355A7D3016FEB1887,"Plan to be there for the whole day. Multiple themed areas with rides for big and smaller kids. If you are a tourist only there for the single day the express pass would probably get you around quicker as some of the attractions can have 1-2 hour waits to get on.For myself the Transformers ride was the highlight/001 kids loved the junior rollercoster and the Madagascar boat rides.There are a variety of food offerings in the park/001 bit overpriced and from our experience not great.Some of the cloth shopping we saw (e.g. Universal shirts) were cheaper than you would expect.

It was still a pretty fun day out but it lacked a bit of character. We bought the express pass which works on majority of the rides at the park and I have to say it paid for itself 5 times over. We skipped numerous ques which had waiting times of over 90 minutes... our longest wait was about 5. It was a lifesaver in the heat as well as a lot of the line areas aren't air conditioned and it was extremely hot. The food was extremely overpriced/001 which you expect so it's fine/001 but it was also really terrible... I don't know if we just chose the wrong places to eat but we didn't like anything. Getting there is super easy/001 it's just a tram ride over and you can buy you ticket to the park when you buy for the tram so you don't have to wait in line twice. I would still recommend going/001 but I won't be going back.

Its strange compared to Japan where people get there 2 hours earlier. Soon as the park open I rushed to the Transformer ride in Sci-Fi. No queue at all. I think you don't have to go to Transformers as the queue are not that long in the afternoon. You should rush to cyclone. I rode it twice. It was the best rollercoaster I ever had. Finish the attractions at Sci-Fi and Egypt. Lost world opens at 11. You should be able to finish all the attractions before 11am and go to the Lost Park. Overall its fantastic.

The Cylon (inverted / suspended blue track) is more exciting as it ends with a 360 degree loop and has a spiral. The first time I sat on it/001 I was thrilled to look upwards to clear blue sky/001 whilst experiencing G force. But this time/001 the wait was 50 mins so we checked out the traditional Human (red track) instead. Surprisingly/001 the wait was only 5 mins/001 after an afternoon rain. In the morning/001 it was a 55 min wait. So we happily sat on Human twice. Although 'tamer'/001 Human is nevertheless still exhilarating.We also recommend Revenge of the Mummy which we also went on twice (5 min wait only)/001 and simply could not get enough of this wild ride in the dark.Canopy Flyer was great too/001 with a 15 min wait only.My overseas guest was thoroughly impressed with Transfomers which is great for all ages/001 and not to be missed (well worth the 40 min wait). It was down in the morning/001 but thankfully was fixed in the afternoon.Lights/001 Camera/001 Action is always exciting to watch/001 for the incredible special effects of a Category 5 hurricane about to hit New York.I also never tire of watching Shrek 4-D Adventure.The new Sesame Street show ""When I Grow Up"" at Pantages Hollywood Theater is really for toddlers and young kids only. Many adults left half way.Due to inclement weather/001 Water World (I always enjoy watching the stunt folks at work) was cancelled.This place is highly recommended for both overseas visitors and locals alike.Families/001 friends and couples will certainly enjoy a great day.The fun atmosphere and enjoyable theme park ambience provides a lovely respite from our stressful lifestyle.TIPS: You can now avail of their lockers for free (upto 45 mins)/001 so glasses/001 handphones and bags can be safely stored before your rides.They have water coolers outside their restrooms. You may even bring an empty bottle to refill water.Try to eat before or after the peak lunch time period.Their burgers and pizza make an affordable and quick tasty re-fueling for the day.Or you can get your re-entry stamp on your hand/001 and eat outside (at Resort World Sentosa with more F&B options) instead.First thing when you enter/001 dash off to the more popular rides such as Battlestar Galactica and Transformer first. We note that the queing time tends to get longer/001 as the day progresses.Bring your umbrella or raincoat as it can rain any time.You really need 1 full day to enjoy this theme park completely.When buying tickets on-line or at their counters/001 check if they have any promotional entry price or special package. There is usually some credit card promotion going on.

Schmerko,Iowa,26 February 2017,Quality Universal Experience,4,FC1F4A876E7B0CBD168CE3AE0A8C58C0,"The Universal Studio's theme park in Singapore is a quality theme park with a mix of favorite attractions from the U.S. parks and new attractions for Singapore. The park is small so you transit from neighborhood to neighborhood fairly quickly. The backdrops/001 sets/001 and street dressing are done well (but due to the smaller size can look a bit odd when you can see the next neighborhood right in the background of the current one).We went on a weekday (hours 10 am to 6 pm I believe). The entry process was fairly smooth and there wasn't much of a rush at 10:15 when we go to the gate. There are many options for purchasing tickets (try to do it on-line and print before you go if for no other reason to just make the process smoother). We had to find a kiosk selling tickets at the park and the signage was less than helpful (it was unclear where they were selling which tickets). Inside the park it was pretty easy (and almost no wait) to get on the rides or attractions for the first few hours. After 1 pm things started to get crowded. I can only image what a weekend may look like (especially Saturday which is the only day they have the character parade and evening fireworks). Food options in the park are pretty standard (fancy themed names for things/001 pretty bland/001 average food at pretty special or high prices).The different show timings were not well advertised (only at the spot of the show itself) and in their program it was unclear which shows would be street performances and which were inside proper facilities. The park also lacks a few rest areas (benches/001 cooling stations/001 etc.) that would make the experience more pleasant.Overall a pretty good experience and we had fun until our little one decided with the heat and jet lag they she had had enough and it was time to go home.

Excellent mix of rides and shows for little ones to the big kids! We waited 60 minutes in line for the raft ride/001 and some were up to 90 minutes long so keep water with you! Good thing is that most waiting areas are undercover. If you don't mind splitting your group up/001 opt for the 'single rider' lane/001 much faster. Transformers ride was excellent!! Good food options and not too expensive as they tend to be in theme parks/001 happy hour drinks at KTs at 4:00 - Fantastic Mojitos!! Note that many rides do not allow bags/hats/sun glasses and you will need to hire a locker for $4/hour - if your wait time goes over the hour you have to pay again to have it unlocked. Tip - if you want to have the sky gondola ride back to Vivo city at end of day/001 buy the combined pass with Universal ticket and save $25 per adult.

Here are my tips on how to enjoy the park:- buying an unlimited express pass is totally worth it! No need to q and u can sit as many times u want on a ride.- Bring your own poncho/raincoat for the Jurassic park water rides/001 buying one inside USS cost $4 each- Be sure to plan to watch the shows/001 such as water world and Sesame Street/001 timings are printed on the brochure- Food is average and quite expensive/001 u could go to the Malaysia food street located beside USS entry for lunch/dinner instead- Bring a water bottle/001 there are water coolers scattered all over the park/001 1 bottle of water cost like $4-5/001 do keep hydrated cuz it's super hot and humid in tropical Singapore- Beware of crowds of tourist from China trying to cut the queues and pushing their way to the front. :(

Katkam978,Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia,23 February 2017,Poor customer service from staff,3,7C3466A20E8F9EBC3A7A18280F02469A,"I have been to the US in Orlando & LA but the one in SIN is the worst because of the staff attitude. Most of the staff have a scowl on their face and not happy to answer any queries. The staff at the carts & the ones attending the rides are just there physically and have this uninterested blank look so please don't ask them anything as they answer you in a patronising manner. Management has done a poor job in training and uplifting the morale of the staff. However thumbs up to Mel's café staff /001 they are the best/001 so cheerful !

Transformers is a must ride/001 crazy good! Just don't eat at the Jurassic park food court/001 food was disgusting beyond disgusting. Go to any food court there other than this one. Also don't ride the Jurassic park ride until last/001 you get absolutely soaked and if you have shoes and socks on it's not a good time lol.

The park has everything between calm and thrilling rides. Some of the rides could have been longer but I say that about every theme park! It's worth getting the express tickets to skip some lines/001 especially when it's busy. I probably won't go again but it was fun for the time I was there.

centralvic,Ballarat- Australia,22 February 2017,Good fun day.,4,BB26D5CDD8779489814BD41AA04A9518,"Fairly typical Universal (though I've only been to LA as well/001 I must admit) but of course it's fun. We went on a Tuesday and though a lot of the rides got longer and longer lines as the day went on/001 we got on most of them within 10 minutes- the only one was Battlestar Galactica/001 which took 30 minutes/001 even early in the day. We liked Waterworld (it's good no matter where you go!) and the Lights/001 Camera/001 Action/001 and Far Far Away Land (Shrek) was fun.

Best place to capture pictures. Relishing rides and amusement park. Theme I loved was Jurassic park. The rides was awesome. The show was too very good. In case you love rollercoaster type rides than it's best place to relish. Walk around the park will let you move into vintage Hollywood landscapes

I have been to Universal in Florida and it is no where as big as there but still great fun. The 2 rollercoasters (Galactica) are fast and well worth it if you like the fast rides. Also the Mummy ride and the Transformer ride are a must!We paid the extra for the express pass and didn't wait more than 5 minutes for anything/001 in fact most of the rides we were able to get on straight away even though it was a Saturday and probably one of the busiest days to go. Well worth a visit.

Emily M,None,21 February 2017,Fun way to spend a day,5,3704852E78E2E5D4852A911C9FBEFD04,"This was our first visit to a Universal Studios park/001 and it did not disappoint. There was a variety of rides to suit everyones interests. Our favourite ride was The Mummy! The architecture and decorations around the park were very impressive/001 it looked almost as if we were really in the movies. You will definitely need almost a whole day here if you want to see and do everything. Queueing times for rides were not too bad when we visited/001 usually not having to wait any more than 20 minutes per ride. The exception to this was the very popular Jurassic Park river ride/001 for which we waited about 1.5 hours in the afternoon/001 so maybe try and get to this one early in the day.There were a variety of food outlets and shops around the park.It was very easy to get to the park via the monorail to Sentosa Island. The monorail stop is right next to the park.

We bought the tickets on line with the express pass. This is the best option to cut the time spent in ques. Also note the express pass is dynamically priced and can go up in price closer to the day you want to visit. Be prepared to spend the whole day at Universal Studios as you will not have time to see other attractions on Santosa. We used the Satosa express from Vivo City and if you are going on the Santosa express line/001 be prepared for a long queue and if it is a public holiday it can get very crowded.Went on the 26th of December 2016

We had the best time ever/001 all the rides are so much fun. We got there about 15 minutes before the park opened and there wasn't much rush at the ticket counter (it was Monday) . We brought the single express ticket which means you can use the express line for each ride once (most of the rides do have an express line). The rides we enjoyed the most were the transformers/001 the mummy ride and the Steven Spielberg experience. Because of the express ticket and not many people we did the whole park by 13:00pm/001 we then sat and watched the mels dinettes performance which was great too!! There are many dining options inside and outside the park/001 if you choose to dine outside the park attendants stamp your hand so you can come out and then go back in.

If you don't have any choice but to go on weekends or holidays/001 skip first the rides cause it will consume most of your time but hang around the place for every photo opt or check out the schedule for the appearance of many USS characters and other attractions (Waterworld).

We went mid week and the lines were still hours long. Some more simple rides and attractions had quick lines.

Also/001 pack light/001 the more things you bring with you the more time you'll spend in the lines for the lockers at the start of rides.

We had free tickets to get in which was good as it is normally quite expensive. We purchased a one off express pass for S$50 each which gave us one express entry per ride. It was well worth it as some of the rides had wait times of 40+ mins which to be fair isn't unreasonable for a theme park. But with it being so hot and with a young child it was better to jump to the front. The park is very clean. It was very crowed with tourists (to be expected).

Romesh J,None,15 February 2017,Great place with even greater queues..,4,6010CE946FD311115C442E2FAC9D626D,"Visited the theme park with my wife and two kids aged 8 and 12. Purchased the standard tickets for about USD 40 pp. Really enjoyed the rides especially the duelling ""battle star galactica"" ride/001 which is not for the faint hearted and the Egyptian section which featured an indoor ride with all sorts of Egyptian monsters to keep us company. The 3D ""Transformers"" ride was also truly enjoyable. The kids also fully enjoyed the 3D movie at Never Never Land. My main grouse however was the very long waiting time for each and every ride. We were only able to complete 5-6 rides during the whole day and each ride had a waiting time of 1 hour or more. So I strongly recommend new visitors especially those with families and/or have just one day to visit/001 to pay extra and buy the fast track tickets. Else you are in for a long wait and risk get your blood pressure up (as I did) by fuming silently at those with fast track tickets sauntering in while you are in the queue for hours...

Its comparatively smaller as compared to US/LA and Japan so crowds tend to cluster on popular rides so its advisable to top on for the VIP pass if you can afford it...

The Jurassic Park ride was not a favourite. You simply got soaked for the sake of it. It was as if the inventors ran out of ideas and figured getting people wet was a sufficient substitute for a lack of imagination. It is an expensive day out the entire family thoroughly enjoyed themselves.

Unbelievably fun!2. Battlestar Galactica - This is the resident roller coaster of Universal Studios Singapore. It's a roller coaster with double the fun! This coaster has 2 rides. The concept is on the name itself/001 Battlestar Galactica. Basically it's like a fight with humans and aliens. One coaster is where you ride as the humans. A basic roller coaster ride. But the other one for me is way more fun: the aliens' side! On this other coaster/001 your feet are hanging! Imagine that! OMG my soul separated from my body during the first drop! I can't overstate enough how fun that ride was!But my most useful tip is this: buy express passes! Again/001 BUY EXPRESS PASSES!!! It's the purchase that I never regretted! It will save you a TON of time! Normal tickets will cost you AN HOUR in line waiting for your turn. But when you use express pass/001 it will literally take you a minute to get to the ride. There's a different line for normal tickets and for express passes. You can see the envy from the eyes of the people who endured long lines waiting. While you just walked in but you get to ride first.

FJ03,None,10 February 2017,Fun day out ,5,5F03ABA93C1AECE843B9A58553AC9998,"My husband and I spent the day here. Now I must mention my husband is an adrenaline junkie /001 whilst I would say I'm the opposite . Thus I felt that the theme park catered to the both of us. Getting here is fairly easy and everything is sign posted . We took the monorail which was fast but packed . I would recommend getting here early and possibly purchasing the fast track tickets for the additional cost . As the queues were very long when we went and for example the transformers ride we waited almost two hours to get in. It was also a very hot and humid day .The studios I mentioned catered to all ages I feel. I've not been to the Florida theme park so can only base my opinion on Singapore . But they have shows /001 roller coasters /001 boat rider /001 souvenir shops and quite a few food outlets on site . There are different themed sections/001 such as the mummy/001 Jurassic park /001 shrek/001 transformers etc and all have there different rides and shows taking place .There are times where you may need to use the lockers as certain rides require no personal belongings. Our personal favourite ride was the water boat ride at Jurassic park. You do get slightly wet but honestly it was a breath of fresh air as we went on a very hot and humid day (humidity was at 98%). Shrek 4D was also good fun and my husband enjoyed this with the chairs moving and splashes of water on the face . The water world show was excellent and the stunts and actors had the audience fully engaged . Staff I found to be lovely honestly /001 they were so helpful and the service was very good. There were a couple times when some of the rides were delayed or experiencing technical problems but apart from that it is a great fun day out for all ages . And the theme park closes at 7pm .

vidhu s,Bengaluru- India,9 February 2017,#1 in Singapore! Here are a few tips!,5,856D88909F9A1746A88AB7D27679DC5F,"I was in Singapore on a family trip of 6 people. My parents and aunt are all above 60 while one of my cousins (24) doesn't like rides. That left me with just two of us who wanted to go to USS but I wasn't sure it justified taking all of them together and that too for an entry ticket priced at $75 each! However/001 it turned out to be the best day we spent in Singapore. One/001 it offers rides and entertainment for people of all the ages. My parents sat in ALL the rides! (I was surprised). Here are the highlights:1. The best ever stage show that I had ever seen (WATERWORLD).2. Best 4D show/ride ever. (TRANSFORMERS)3. Lights/001 Camera and Action.4. Great rides for adventure freaks.Here are some tips for all:TIP 1: try to visit it on a weekday. Although the queues that we found were on an average only 20%-30% occupied (of the capacity)/001 we still ended up waiting for up to 30 minutes in a few rides.TIP 2: it is arranged in a circular layout. As soon as you enter it/001 look for where the crowd seems to be heading. Start walking in the opposite direction! ;)TIP 3: Single passengers have a separate queue. If you don't have a condition to sit together on a ride/001 it will save at least 70% of your time.TIP 4: Buy your tickets through an agent in Singapore. I got my tickets at a discount of $20 per person.TIP 5: This was the only attraction I found which gives discounted tickets for the elderly (60+) irrespective of their nationality. Tickets for my parents costed me $36 each.TIP 5: Food is very expensive inside. If you don't wanna spend that much/001 try getting something with you. (Before entering USS you will also find a few joints like McDonald's).

Peter B,Shepparton,5 February 2017,Not great for small kids and very expensive.,3,87A332514B0C4757E432FBDFFC89A7F4,"Many of the rides had height and age limits and prevented our younger children from access. We visited on a normal weekday in the late afternoon and the rides had anticipated wait times in excess of an hour. With the few hours we had planned to stay we would be lucky if we got to ride 3 attractions. It appears that this is normal as the queues were designed to hold hundreds of people with in queue entertainment. The rides we did experience were very well done and the park was very clean. It was extremely hot on the day of our visit and some of the queues were very uncomfortable even with the fans. We got very poor value for our money and they should offer half day tickets and much cheaper prices for young kids.

Also/001 many of the rides are also indoors (like Transformers and the Mummy) so you can still do things even in the rain. The one bonus of the rain was that some rides had shorter breaks than usual (especially after they would stop and re-start after rain storms). Although good weather would have made it more enjoyable/001 we were glad to still have a fun day even with all the rain.

yssunil,Singapore- Singapore,4 February 2017,Queueing is the way of life ,3,3D2D97CD0339A8F50AA150027BC7FDC5,"Straight to the point- weekends are crazy rush. Some staff have told me that Wed or Thu is a bit better but the pain of queueing will remain.- if you are a tourist I would advise to buy an express ticket else you will repent to having paid the ticket price and yet not experiencing half the rides.- don't miss the waterworld show. Also don't bother to go and queue early. It's a large seating space and you will get a good seat.- pick up the event timing sheets. Some shows are worth to visit.- hidden gem is the Guinness record of maximum lights inside an enclosed space within the Hollywood area. Check the picture attached. - No food allowed inside. Don't carry any else you will have to unnecessarily rent a locker to store your stuff

nishantsatyamm,Bengaluru- India,4 February 2017,Awesome place to have multi- varied rides but Express pass is a must,5,45737EEF8122DB8C5619DAAF35911BD6,"Galactica/001 Mummy/001 Transformers ride are the usp of the place/001 rest others are around average. An express is a must otherwise you can have to wait for around hours for few of the rides.

thehopster,Singapore- Singapore,4 February 2017,Its all about the timing,4,47FF90DDA4F7D3DD9C6FC9DBE3ACAB48,"We arrived at 10am and left at 8.30pm/001 so that says something!I suggest arriving around 930am so as to be one of the first in and plan the things you want to tick off first as by 11am+ the lines might start backing up. There is surprisingly a lot to do. At first glance you think it might be small/001 but it is quite large and the space is very well utilised. Lots of different themes and the kids will love it. There is also enough for the parents. Food was not the best (at least in the American diner we went to) and it is really overpriced. Suggest you head out of the park walk 2 mins into other parts of Resorts World to have a better dining experience. Make sure to get a stamp on the way out to save the grief re-entering the park. We found that come 5pm or so the park clears out and all of a sudden it takes all of 5 mins to get on a ride. I spent the next couple of hours taking advantage of checking out all the rides as many times as I could.Bottom line - Great day out and well worth the visit.

Prittravel1,Singapore- Singapore,3 February 2017,Awesome experience,5,109427F42560CEB23953AD7C465EAD4C,"We ultimately ended up buying annual pass to USS. The rides are awesome and thrilling. Best rides are cylone/001 transformer/001 galactica and mummy. Usually the queue is long and might take time to take ride on any given weekend. But the trick is to keep thrilling rides until late afternoon when the crowd starts to thin down and disperse. Till then enjoy regular shows/001 madagascar/001 shrek/001 jurassic park.

Lauren P,None,3 February 2017,Great for those who love the movies!,4,A58F34C1E12B7C7AF718C511D479201C,"I really enjoyed geeking out over the movies and the transformers ride was insanely good!If you buy a ticket with an optional transfer to the park I would recommend just making your own way there. They pick you up at 8:30am when the park doesn't open till 10am as they stop lots to pick people up and just sit for a while in a car park. Better to get a bit longer sleep and just go there directly. Some of the movies/themes are a bit outdated now like battlestar galactica and waterworld.

Solomon L,None,3 February 2017,The better Disneyland!,5,747FDFB38BCB65355B6301B04E7CF329,"Filled with roller coasters/001 shows/001 shops and more/001 I absolutely love Universal Studios. My personal favourites from my last visit includes Spielberg's Lights Camera Action/001 the Guinness World Record Lights display/001 and the Transformers Ride (name). Starting with Spielberg's Lights Camera Action show/001 I love the way they compress the complex process of movie special effects into ten minutes. From the small details such as the sound of rain tapping at the side/001 to the large fiery explosion engulfing the set/001 the ten minute spectacle is certainly worth watching for anyone who has watched a movie/001 just for an idea of how it's done. Then the lights display.

There are all sorts of events and activities from some of the most iconic movies from universal studios. You'll be amazed how well planned this is. There are all sorts of fun activities for people of all age. If you're are planning a trip to Singapore this has to be a must visit.

adithyaanuroop,Chennai (Madras)- India,2 February 2017,How to get your money's worth at USS,5,CC6365354FC17111396B487F104D02EC,"Enough has been said about the rides and attractions at USS so let me know just give you some tips on how to get there/001 where to store your backpack/001 how to save money/001 where to eat and other hacks. GETTING THERE:* We took a cab to Sentosa Island on our first day/001 While chatting with the cab driver/001 he used the phrase ""everything is money my friend"" which I experienced firsthand. From your research you might already arrived at a conclusion that getting inside sentosa involves an entry fee either through Sentosa Express (SGD4)/001 taxi (SGD2-6/001 based on time of entry) or own car. But there is another option for people to enter Sentosa Island without paying anything. Yeah/001 you guessed it right/001 its the SENTOSA BOARDWALK. Situated at Level 1 of Vivo City mall/001 this 500m boardwalk take you to Sentosa Island free of charge and hey/001 you don't have to walk. Just take the travelator and enjoy the scenery en route. The boardwalk is free of cost upto 31st Dec'17. Its funny how you cannot see a single signboard pointing towards the boardwalk entry point. Get to L1 of Vivo City Mall and pass by the Tung Lok Signatures restaurant to get to the boardwalk.DRINKING WATER* Always carry an bottle with you to avoid purchase of water bottles at extra cost. All the rides have drinking water fountains to fill up on water. This applies to entire Singapore for that matter. We never purchased a bottle of water anywhere during our stay.FREE LOCKERS FOR YOU BACKPACK* You might have come across numerous posts advising you not to carry a backpack in USS since it might be a burden to carry around. Well/001 who DOESNT need a backpack right? I mean where are you going to store you towels/001 selfie sticks/001 change of clothes and snacks (shhhhhhhhh/001 you might get lucky if you play your cards right ;) )The trick is to keep the weight of the backpack to the bare minimum and use he free lockers available at some places. * There are free backpack storage places but they do come with a catch. They are free for only 45minutes after which you need to pay SGD4. However/001 there is no limit to the number of times you use the free lockers. All you need to do is check the waiting time for the ride and store the bags accordingly. There is a locker space available in Ancient Egypt section/001 where you can find the Revenge of the Mummy one of the best rides in USS. Also/001 it is close to The Lost World (Jurassic Park) where you can hop on the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure/001 another awesome ride. Trick is to find the free locker spaces and use them wisely cos you only need one person to hold your space for the ride/001 if you catch my drift ;)PONCHO* Weather conditions are as unpredictable as the US Presidential Elections. It might rain anytime/001 anywhere. You just need to be equipped enough to face it and take advantage of it. Yes/001 I meant take advantage of it because people don't venture in rain/001 duh. That is where having a poncho can come to your rescue. Ponchos nothing but plastic raincoats made of thin material which serves its purpose at a much cheaper cost than purchasing an umbrella at USS @ USD10/001 ONLY. Ponchos are available at 2 for SGD5. You just need to ask for those.FOOD @ USS* Numerous restaurants and food carts are available inside USS but the prices come to an average of SGD10 if you want to purchase anything. It is mentioned clearly that outside food/snacks are not allowed inside but they do not check you bags inside out. They just ask you to open up and show the items inside. So it is up to you to purchase food/snacks/drinks inside USS or sneak some inside *wink wink*TIPS:1. Finish all the popular rides like Battle Star Galactica (sci-fi city/001 roller coaster)/001 Revenge of the Mummy (Ancient Egypt)/001 Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure and Canopy Flyer (The Lost World)/001 during the lunch break when the waiting times are less. 2. Checkout the timings of shows like Waterwold (The Lost World)/001 Sesame Street (New York) and be there ahead of time to beat the queue.3. Try to plan your visit during the middle of the week like Tues/001 Wed. Waiting time might climb to even 90minutes during peak season and public holidays.4. Get a Universal Express entry pass if you want to beat the line/001 not applicable only for a few rides.If you research and plan your trip to USS properly/001 you can get the maximum out it. Definitely would recommend to everyone across different age groups.

Meidha A,None,2 February 2017,great rides,4,C937988DBAED59E67219730C5D3F92F5,"I came when it was raining but I pretty much tried almost all rides that I want to ride. I first tried Transformers since it's indoor/001 and then I tried Battlestar Galactica Human/001 it was not really scary as I thought. If you want more extreme you should try Cylon one. The revenge of the mummy was a really nive experience because you ride roller coaster indoor and dark. it was really good.

Mandie B,Dubai- United Arab Emirates,2 February 2017,Fun filled family day - Sad about the rain!,5,D2B0F95D752A193F191E2F050E12B3FC,"We had a great time at Universal Studios Singapore. It was fun rides for the whole family/001 great food and loads to see and explore. It was a bit humid and warm on arrival but this soon changed as we were about 1/4 into the park. It started raining...more like pouring down with thunder galore. This was such a pity because the whole park comes to a standstill and all except 2-3 rides stop working if there is thunder accompanying the rain. Luckily we went prepared with some ponchos in our bags/001 but even this was not enough for the down pouring because we were walking around in water about ankle high. We ultimately missed about 2-3 hours in our day just standing around under shelter waiting for the rain to subside which eventually did but because there was still thunder warnings the park remained to close the rides. I would def visit this park again/001 I would just plan to miss the rain and go on a sunny day. But seeing that Singapore has rain pretty much everyday I don't know why the creators didn't plan for the park to be more equipped to function in the rain or accommodate their visitors. We flew into Singapore and only had the one day to make Universal Studios work/001 so sad for us. And you pay quite a bit for tickets/001 so again...make it work for the visitors and instead having 80% of the park under rain and only 20% under roof in a tropical place with rain all the time....the math is a bit off I should say. It just leaves sad faces on kids that had been excited for this visit for weeks. What did save us was the booking of tickets online and the express passes. We only bought the package allowing one express pass and this helped us getting most of the rides in once the park opened fully again. The ques were endless since it was over peak season. So well worth the extra couple of bucks paid. We had our 5/001 10/001 16 yrs old boys with us. Got some great shots to remember and relived some of the family favorite movies!!

We started from the entrance then went left for kids at far far away land then jerrasic park land then Egypt lands then sci fic where transformers are/001 in between them both lovely roller coasters very fast/001 then we ended at new York lands/001 for more fun i advice you at the entrance to buy the fast track where its very very useful we couldn't finish all zones at one day without it.. each ride that takes 45 m waiting line it took us 5 min to ride .. plus if you are single you can also use the fast track express as a single rider in most rides. Water lands opens at 3 pm .. also look at the schedule of the shows and try to catch up especially in new york the dancing band are very good. I didnt buy anything from stores to not carry many toys and gifts because the universal store at the gate have almost everything and every character u will see inside/001 so i bought when i was leaving just next to the gate/001 out side you can find some nice restaurants for dinner. Park starts from 10 am to 9 pm Wish you a happy experience

m r,LIVERPOOL,2 February 2017,Don't get stung on fast pass charges. Disgraceful experience!,3,9B2CF4B7471180F7E06719665F57E6B0,"Went here at the end of December as a party of four. On the way in/001 we asked about the price of ""fast pass"" tickets and it was 80 dollars each. Quite expensive on top of tickets/001 so had a think about it. Within ten minutes of asking the price/001 we went to buy them/001 only to be told they were now 100 dollars each! Unbelievable/001 but apparently this is normal practice. If the place is busy/001 they hike up the price. Absolutely disgraceful! Have been to Universal studios in other countries/001 have never known this happen. Also/001 couldn't use a lot of the rides due to the weather being bad/001 bug they don't offer a reduction in the price!
