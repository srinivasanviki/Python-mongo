Hazarina Z|None|3 May 2017|Please avoid to visit USS during public holiday.|3|B97990727A6763AEC4FD04FBA27F6585|- Over crowded place. Most rides that had public attraction has longer waiting queue. Please purchase the Express Pass if you want to enjoy the rides with minimum waiting time.- Food was quite OK/001 had lunch at the restaurant near the Madagascar area. - Due to the gloomy weather towards the evening/001 most of the rides has stopped including the parade at the Hollywood lane.- I am aggrieved of the condition of the prayer room; which is located at the back and only can accommodate 5 persons at one time (in each male and female room). Perhaps the Management can allocate a dedicated area which is more comfortable for the Muslims to pray.
730matthew|Sydney- Australia|3 May 2017|over crowded|3|702DCFB52F12F9D295F6ACDD2B7F1851|we visited the universal studio/001 it was over crowded/001 it took 2 hours to queue for the transformer ride ( 4 min ride)...
Manu S|Kochi (Cochin)- India|2 May 2017|Great place to spend a day in Singapore|4|C068712DC3CE593F25C7D33B628F358E|This place offers many activities/rides with a theme that resembles some of the hollywood movies. You will never be bored on any of the rides. There are plenty of Food and beverages outlets inside the vicinity and hence one doesn't have to go out to get a snack or so.Everyone from a kid to a 60-70 year old will definitely enjoy this place
Kurt S|None|2 May 2017|Fantastic day|5|2E27B3F529E94D3115CFB3027B28476D|Had an awsome time with my mates here. Stayed for 8 hrs/001 downfall is waiting on some of the rides bt is a must do
pkj71|Bengaluru- India|2 May 2017|Over-crowded  waste of time and money|1|4A6FB9E686E7A9D686706A9C61784079|They have no limit on number of tickets they will sell on a day and the place gets over-crowded during holiday season or weekends. Each ride takes 60-90 minutes in never ending queues in Singapore hot weather and for a mere 2-3 minute ride. The entire amusement park is too small and over-hyped. The children below 10 years cannot enter so many rides. If you are still keen to visit the place/001 enter through single rider queues. Though you miss the fun of being together with your family and friends but the same is worth as the waiting time is reduced to 5-10 minutes as against normal 60-90 minutes.
Marwa T|None|2 May 2017|Amazing|5|88B7F8037078BC222929C1176146B6F7|The most worthy and amazing place to visit in Singapore..if you have one day there and you don't know where to go then go to Unoversalstudios for sureIf you're a tourist /001then buy express pass from the start before wasting a time in waiting lines
Kim M|Logan City- Australia|2 May 2017|Transformer 3D ride and Cylon Ride are the best|3|6525C5834D59EC4E8EC7585843A27F86|Firstly to be fair we live near all the theme parks on the Gold Coast in QLD Australia and because we go to these on a regular basis we couldn't help but compare USS to these. My husband and I both agree that it pales in comparison to what we are use to getting from our theme parks here in Australia. We found that there were only really 4 rides for adults (the two dualing roller coasters/001 transformers 3D ride and the mummy ride) and that the rest are all kid rides. These four rides were great but after riding them/001 and then watching the waterworld show there was nothing left for us to do there. There was excessive amounts of stores and restaurants and plenty of kids rides/001 so would be better for families I imagine. Also I wouldn't even attempt to do USS without buying the express pass. The lines were ridiculously long and we were thankful we spent the extra money. The Cylon ride was pretty much always at around an hour long. Getting into the park itself was also a joke we got there at bang on opening and waited for 40minutes in line just to get in and we went on a weekday. Overall we had a good day but we only spent four hours there all up and paid just over a hundred dollars each for the tickets and express pass/001 so it was an expensive four hours.
Dave W|None|2 May 2017|Disappoint |2|2F42A7B8C17A45C9004C9B9FFFBD5D3D|Great looking place but don't be fooled buy the repressive price of food and beverage all it poured rain which everyone had to pay 5dollars each for ponchos very small compared to America overcrowding 20 dollars maximum day for lockers even express pass was not what it seemed to help when told we have to wait 30 minutes for ride only gave 2stars because it was nice to look at this adventure was a waste of time and money have been to other universal parks and this is a poor rip off of original certainly will recommend to all l know how bad this experience was totally devastated to come so far for this
RajeevManiar|Vadodara- India|2 May 2017|Universal Studios make Singapore Amazing|5|C724828EE774B19F40975807415A8465|A must see... Never to miss - A complete family and friends destination. Rides/001 Foods/001 Dance/001 Road shows/001 Shopping - You think it at they have it. Take a map - probably a day earlier so you can plan the rides you would like. Start the day as early as possible so you get more time to spend at the Universal studios. Great Adventure - never to be missed. Children above 7 will enjoy a lot.
shuv2013|Calcutta- West Bengal- India|2 May 2017|Back to the Childhood...|5|7E94B5B0EBCFB41A93DC5E9DE22627E7|I have visited this place on 27th April'17 and still excited remembering the super duper time I have spent there with my wife. I must say its the best Amusement Park among the parks I have visited yet. If you don't have health related problem/001 may enjoy the rides like Battlefield Galactica/001 Transformer and Mummy's Revenge. A perfect place for memorable photo shoots. Shows are excellent. Carnival only on Saturdays. Ticket is only SGD 76.00 and worth paying this much amount. Restaurants in Universal studio are expensive. Rather purchase food from outside before you enter.
saruwhite|Hong Kong- China|1 May 2017|Nice place to spend the day|4|7F34255A6BCA24823B2E1F083AEBE626|Some attractions are different from the one in Japan/001 so they are new to us. Lots of roller coasters in the park! If you are looking for excitement/001 there you go! Prepare to get wet unexpectedly in some attractions too. Went on a Sunday and not too many people/001 which is good. We got the express pass and the longest wait was just 15 min. Most attractions you can get on it within 5 min/001 which saved us lots of time. Recommend getting one/001 which is SGD50 for one ride each/001 or SGD80 for unlimited rides. Last but not least/001 the minions and sesame street characters are sooooo cute!!
dtkreddy|chittoor|1 May 2017|Enjoyable with lot of joy|5|F60A92C9E0F758E711E03E5802C611A6|Oh what an experience. Very nice. No words to tell. Just Enjoy. U will become a small kid. must must visit this.
firemanwal|None|1 May 2017|Disappointing|3|B1CE3C5A76581D158DF37542342F39CF|Probably expected more/001 as in maybe a museum or history of Universal. Mainly it was rides for popular movies and hundreds of souvenir shops. But in saying so/001 it was good for the kids as they could identify the characters and the associated movies. You also have to line up for at least an hour to get in.
KateSydney|Epping- Australia|1 May 2017|A fun  fun day|5|3E417CD57D7DD0282D59987BF5F5ECDB|What a great day we had at Universal Studios. Our large extended family (8 adults/001 7 children/001 ages ranging from 3 to 65!) all enjoyed it immensely. The rides were so much fun and the Waterworld Show was really good. There are not a lot of rides for little kids but they enjoyed those they could go on. Those of us who liked the more exciting rides were in their element! We arrived around 9.45 and left at 5.15. A TIP: The express pass is a MUST! Yes/001 it does make the day rather expensive but we did not have to wait for more than 5 mins for any of the rides. The waiting time for some of the rides was 80 mins. By having the express pass we were able to go on all the rides and everyone was happy! We bought the express pass which gave you one turn on each ride - there really is not enough time to do each ride more than once. This cost was $50 as we went on a Saturday/001 if you visit on weekdays it is $30. Such a great place to visit.
wozcor|Melbourne- Australia|1 May 2017|A great afternoon out at Sentosa|3|EC693A081B12C3EEDC4AF431BAE56022|Cue times were around 45 mins so just make sure you purchase the express pass to get on rides faster.
Stuart C|England- United Kingdom|30 April 2017|Excellent Visit|5|790BE3B77A4DAEB9467EBD4F9039B4F4|My Family & I visited Universal Singapore for one day in April.What a great Park/001 certainly not as big as Universal in California or Florida however still a great day out.The ride Queues were 20 minutes maximum all day/001 this allowed us to ride all of the attractions during the day.Top Rides to go on - Jurassic Park.The Mummy.Battlestar Galactica (Cylon)Transformers 4D.Shrek 4D.Special effects stage.Waterworld Show.Plenty of souvenir shops/001 food stalls and restaurants both inside and outside the park.Great day out highly recommend/001 Pre book your ticket on the internet to gain a cheeper price.
MM0311|Mumbai|30 April 2017|Super fun! |5|64FAEA9939E7C68A5893A7D0FE0A7AEA|Universal studios is super duper fun/001 and a must visit in Singapore! You can take the free internal train in Sentosa to reach it. Go for the famous and in demand transformers ride and you will have the time of your life - you will definitely want to sit on it more than once! The other roller coasters in the "science" section made me queasy so i won't recommend them if you get sick on such rides/001 but Transformers is a must do. After this section/001 which is at the beginning of the park/001 take the time to visit each section and see what you would enjoy. Universal has a lot to offer/001 and reach early so you can spend the entire day here and do justice to this fun place. The pizza place here is really good/001 even for vegetarians/001 and you will get good ice-cream to beat the hot weather. If you travel with kids/001 they will enjoy the Puss in Boots and Madagascar shows that are in the evening/001and the 3D movie. Take the time out to take pictures with all the cartoon characters that hang out with you in the evening/001 they are fun to look at later :). In a nutshell/001 Universal Studios is a must visit in Singapore - make sure you reach early and you spend the day here!
Targarian|None|30 April 2017|Worth to Visit|5|3EBA2958261E724EE14362A1A4365D88|I have been there for 2 times in one week. Both the times I enjoyed each of the segment immensenly. Its amazing and a treat for kids up to age 15.
Manish B|None|30 April 2017|Rain spoils Hollywood parade|4|5DBEB03AFDCF114742727C3EB9A6E6B7|I visited USS on 14th Apr with my family/001 which was a public holiday in Singapore and therefore couple of extra events were scheduled i.e. Hollywood parade at 3;00 pm and Fireworks at 8:30pm. However/001 due to rains/001 the hollywood parade was cancelled. There was a huge rush in all the places - minimum 30 mts waiting for few rides we waited for over 90 minutes. The long queue for Transformer ride ran into multiple halls and two levels/001 which reminded us about the queue at Shirdi temple. There are no pure vegetarian eating joint inside USS and looks like a good business opportunity for Kailash Parbat/001 Anand Bhawan/001 etc Despite above issues/001 we had a great time and memorable trip. The most interesting rides were Jurassic park/001 Transformer/001 Madagascar/001 Speilberg show.
WheresDuke|Sydney- Australia|30 April 2017|Excellent fun park on Sentosa Island|5|FA421A7469B07CB0050D55AEC8165096|We visited Universal Studios as one of the predetermined "Must-Dos" during our 5 night stay in Singapore and we weren't disappointed. We pre-purchased our tickets (recommended) prior to getting to the park/001 so avoided the box office queue. We also purchased our VIP pass for the rides inside the park (definitely recommended) which gave us access to walk up starts to all rides/001 rather than queuing for 40 odd minutes. We loved our time there; some highlights: the Madagascar ride/001 the Sesame Street show and spaghetti ride/001 the awesome Transformers ride/001 the Mummy ride/001 the rollercoaster/001 the water fountain park in Jurassic Park. The choice of food was actually really good for a fun park/001 and you can get a beer if you want.We will be back.
Ryan B|Dubai- Dubai- United Arab Emirates|29 April 2017|Fun|5|AE5CC166731D5239E805C334B7D7428F|My enjoyed some of the rides. We couldn't go to other place coz of the weather/001 it's too hot and too difficult for family who have childrens below 1 year old. I carried my 1 year old daughter throughout the place
Jillian L|Perth- Australia|28 April 2017|Better for younger families|4|F37C3554F24535E560868B1A1AB916D5|Went with teenage son (for second time first was in 2011). The best rides for excitement were Transformers (new)/001 Cylon and Mummy. Other rides really for younger kids/families. Went before 10.00 (gates opened at 9.50 and took 20 mins to get in). Recommend staying in a close hotel/001 so when queues really long had a relax at our hotel 3-5.00pm. Went back and the lines so much shorter/001 stayed doing roller coasters until 7.00pm close. Had lots of fun but for the teenager go somewhere else with a lot more thrills.
Chris H|None|28 April 2017|Fun Family Day  but expect things to be expensive!|3|D57B8986F4AB93910A1795980CCB3F0A|There's no need to explain what Universal Studios is... you probably already know!There are heaps of great rides/001 fantastic shows and other entertainment. My family absolutely loved going there! It is a quality park.We attended mid week in the middle of April/001 so thought it'd be a bit quiet... Ques were fairly reasonable/001 however for some rides we waited upwards of an hour even when the advisory signs suggested 30mins... i'd hate to imagine wait times in peak season!If your children are over 1.2m tall/001 they'll be able to go on every ride in the park! This thrilled my 7 year old son!Tip for buying your tickets... Head into China Town to the Peoples Palace Shopping mall (Big Old Green Building) head upstairs to the travel agencies and buy your tickets through them. It'll cost a lot less than buying at the gate. Just check for online deals first to give some slight negotiating power!Just beware/001 when you're in the park expect to pay close to four times the price for food and drinks as you would elsewhere in Singapore/001 It is after all on Sentosa!
RachelM087|Oxford|27 April 2017|Good day out|4|E06A5122EA93831A97DC873EDF4BD9B6|The park was clean and the attractions were good. Not really comparable to the parks in the USA/001 but still a good day out.We had a lot of rain in the afternoon/001 which meant the outdoor rides were closed. If you get there early & the weather is good then I would advise you go on those rides first.
ramsdesk|Bangalore|27 April 2017|Ok - Not the best|3|1CB66772E946B9B8C15575B2FF605BE9|Lots of hype about Universal Studios in Singapore. This is just not in comparison with the original at LA but this is decent enough for the space-crunched Singapore and attractive enough for the locals and visitors alike. No comparison/001 please. Notable rides which I enjoyed were the Transformers and Egypt one.. rest were ok but if you are with kids/001 they will enjoy every single ride and attraction. You will need one full day at this place. Try to buy tickets online at several third party sites where you may get discounts on meal vouchers or shopping vouchers (watch out for riders/fine prints).
Byron O|St. Ives- Australia|27 April 2017|Lots of fun!|5|130C93316F72AB9725A5E4BAE308345B|My wife and I spent 2 days at Universal Studios Singapore. It was a great time. We have already been to Universal Studios in Los Angeles and Orlando. Although not quite as big/001 there was still plenty to do in 2 days. We took someone's advice from Trip Advisor and bought the 6 month pass with fast entry also. It is cheaper than buying 2 separate one day passes (there are no 2 days passes - only one day and then 6 months). We also got 10% discount on all F&B in Universal plus on any other purchases. It was worth paying for the fast pass otherwise the most popular rides you could be waiting for up to one hour to get on. We only had to wait a maximum of 5 minutes! I highly recommend Universal Studios/001 Singapore as a a great theme park that is well run.
qwertylinda|Melbourne- Australia|27 April 2017|Fun Day|4|4ACF2B9E54E3AA9AEF9D6A6B6FBD73B0|Had a fantastic day at Universal Studios! It did not disappoint. The rides were great/001 The Transformer & Cylon were the best. We ended up buying the express pass which added an extra $50 onto the cost of entry; however it paid off for us on the day. Keeping in mind we went at off peak season. Easy to get the train there. As expected the food & beverages can get a little pricey/001 after all it is a theme park. Worth the $$/001 had a blast☺️
santoshbh|Bengaluru- India|27 April 2017|Good for one full day|4|355287E4CC5801758A7EFBAA784B31F0|Happening place in Sentosa. you need almost one full day for USS. if you start in time at 10 am/001 you need time till 6 pm for it. if you are visiting on weekends or public holidays/001 with young kids then strongly suggest taking express pass. Keep track of the different shows/events which happens in different places inside USS. Better to start at 10 am so that you have little less crowd. One major sour about the place was no options of Vegetarian food at all. We hardly found one place selling Veggie food. Probably something for the management to look out for. Better to buy the tickets online to beat the queue. Also if you are in hotels where they provide handy phones/001 then booking from it will also give discounts.
VikramBopanna|Bangalore- Karnataka- India|27 April 2017|A day of enthralling entertainment!|5|679BA5C0CAE1E449DF6935627E0CAF79|A place not to be missed! Universal Studios is so entertaining that in fact a full day is not sufficient to explore all that it has to offer!
Nasim R|None|27 April 2017|Fabulous experience |5|EEF312BE3703CCD423E04F249FEDF491|It's a wonderful place to spend a whole day. Although the ticket price is high/001 it will not waste your money-will give you a different experience. Many items to explore & entertainment. Please keep rain coat/ umbrella to avoid raining; however you can buy also inside the park.
itspji|Auckland|27 April 2017|Great fun|5|3AFAB6275770C3C4AE8C2EE96BD469D0|You can do this in a day as it is a small park compared to the USA/001 but we are already planning what we will do on our next visit. Staff are great and there is a lot to do. Go early for the popular rides or enjoy the queues. Book online with MasterCard far the best discounts currently and 10% discount at the outlets with MasterCard over $sg20
Prapaiporn W|None|26 April 2017|Jewkid|1|D747C052F5D2C739723703FDEAF5C7FB|Waste of time at universal. Really bad. Bad infrastructure. Pay high cost ticket but can't play anything because it has very long queue. The staffs always shout customer/001 not polite.
KARTINI S|Perak- Malaysia|26 April 2017|Muslim trip :UNIVERSAL STUDIO SINGAPORE|5|DD09CD0E25C2A0186DAB193DC1506846|Our family adores theme parks. We have always enjoyed attractions offered..USS has many roller coaster which test you to the limit especially the high speed Cyclon vs Human. My son and husband really enjoyed themselves on these rides whilst my daughter and I enjoyed street performance by Rockafella and a few others. At the faraway land/001 we enjoyed the 4D movie. Amenities wise easy access to halal food/001 transportation and prayer hall. Thumbs up!!
salbern|Kaiapoi- New Zealand|26 April 2017|Use the single rider lanes|5|613FDEB57846D58896BFAD5C7C18ED42|We learnt very quickly to take advantage of the single rider lanes - these generally move faster than the group lines but it means you may not do the ride with your friends/family as you are mainly gap fillers.
msb444|Manila- Philippines|26 April 2017|The Cylon|5|751BAE554B10183F8EBFB3B2F1E336F8|I love roller coasters. The best ride for me was the Cylon/001 one of the Battlestar Galactica rides. It is a 2 seater ride with your feet dangling in the air. The first drop is scream worthy. I went on a weekday and was at the entrance 15 min before opening and got on almost all the rides in less than 5 minutes. We were able to ride all the man attractions except for the Jurassic park rapids adventure. Made the mistake of reserving it for last and had to wait for an hour. Unfortunately/001 the ride was cancelled due to inclement weather (lightning). It's pretty pricey but worth it if you can get on all or at least most of the main attractions. Sing$76/001 express additional $30. If you don't mind riding alone/001 take the single rider. Its free. The park is clean. Most people seem to come in the late afternoon when it is not too hot. Be sure to bring water/001 a hat and wear sunblock. It is hot.
Cary15|Auckland- New Zealand|26 April 2017|Universal Singapore what they don't highlight to tell you|2|791563CB93C9DEE2806F76E423DB2D7D|I had great expectations of a family trip to Universal Studios in Singapore but what a let down not only for the price but also some of the staff. What they don't highlight before you spend your money to go into the park is any heavy rain / thunder then lightning they stop the rides/001 yes it is a safety risk and I understand that but when they don't have many thrilling rides which are inside and you have a teenager/001 then this is not the park for you. We had paid extra for a fast pass. I know you can't control the weather but you can control notices to inform people so they can pick a better day to visit/001 being given an umbrella from guest services is not the answer or go to the shows that was suggested as well!
Essack M|Johannesburg- South Africa|26 April 2017|Can get busy|4|B41C8219C674A8FD63FBFAC9ED328E05|The theme park has great rides. The problem will be the queues- so if you can afford/001 get a fast pass.Food on the resort is not too badly priced. All in all/001 it was a fun experience.
Abataa|Tehran|25 April 2017|Amazing !|5|C59812F8B45DFC81CE41BCDBEA568E93|It is a wonderful experience. Don't miss it !The most exciting game is the fast train. There are two/001 both of them are perfect. Go there in a working day if you can/001 to avoid crowded line of waiting for each game. There is a 3D cinema there/001 it's so interesting.
Gamemita G|None|25 April 2017|Exciting.|5|1E8AEF39C793D0B3368C8970004E9E40|Hello Universal Studio - Singapore.I liked for all of there. i appreciate for transformer experience is so great and so exciting. And the roller coasters for Human VS Cylon. I played for human is so exciting but i can't to play for Cylon because i haven't time to wait. If you want to playing all/001 i will suggest you to pay express when you booking the ticket for entrance there.
Ellie_Buffy_Beer|Ballarat- Australia|25 April 2017|Fun for all ages |4|0CE8A2591E6E8A986301C57878E20D68|Love Universal all over the world & Singapore does it well. Rides were exciting and fun/001 queues weren't too long early and the option for buying the express pass is a great add on. The park is clean/001 especially the toilets and the food and beverage options are good.
SharathMK|Bangalore|25 April 2017|Awesome experience|5|F75A970709FEA1371AA02E135DDBA804|Very well maintained and organised/001 the attractions were awesome/001 suggest you to wear light clothes (short and Tshirt are best) with a good walking shoes/001 wait time is too much (thanks to the overwhelming number of tourists on weekends)/001 best avoid weekends and public holidays. As much as you may be tempted to take photos/001 keep that for the end/001 focus on finishing as many rides as possible it takes seconds for a queue to fill up and hours for it to clear up.Recommended rides > Transformers : Please please please do not miss this one/001 the experience is totally out of the world/001 though it is a short ride/001 it will leave you literally on the edge of your seats.> Madagascar : slow ride but totally worth it/001 the whole of the first Madagascar movie is recreated as an awesome exprience> Galactica : Not for the faint of heart/001 this ride provides great adrenaline rush/001 you will go all over the place even after you have stepped out of the ride :)> Jurassic World : It took us 1.5 hrs standing in the queue to finally sit on this ride/001 but the wait was worth it/001 especially once the rough part starts/001 great experience.> Far Far away (Shrek) : this is a good one as well/001 lord farquaad tries his best to torture you/001 its quite funny actually.> Revenge of the Mummy : i missed this one and i regret it/001 have heard great reviews of this one/001 but if you have a kid that doesn't match the required height then you will not be allowed/001 this is the reason we couldn't take this ride (though we could have taken turns/001 but it would have taken a lot of time)> Water World : slightly cheesy/001 but the actors put a lot of effort into this one which makes it really great/001 no special effects what so ever/001 hats off to the energy of these artists.Overall as i said/001 keep calm and complete all the rides first/001 it would do really good if you go early morning/001 the place opens at 10:00/001 so best be there by 9:30/001 get inside/001 take the first right and complete Transformers :) .. you surely wouldn't want to miss this one
VOK1976|Melbourne- Australia|25 April 2017|Great place for families |5|65A1507CDDBEFD1D1CAB870F84B6A0B3|Great place for a family to visit with exciting rides. Recommend buying a 6 mth pass if you intend visiting for more than one day. Express pass is a must.
Ruffa C|None|25 April 2017|A magical experience!|5|F84C8967D9FBE656EFA1ADAB73DDE6E9|It's like you were kid playing in the huge playground. Plenty of amusement around. For you not to queue too much/001 buy the fast lane card for SGD30.00 so you don't need to wait for a long queue.
HiddenWorldsMx|Vancouver- Washington|25 April 2017|What to say?|4|D89F6AE80E5DD2E49CE0898DFEE86CA2|They are always doing a great job. The place is crowded- the lines are long but worth it. The food is good park food. Anyplace in the world/001 universal studios does a great job!

Luke C|None|25 April 2017|Must Visit|5|457E8BF1041A2654644942314DA09B8B|If you're in Singapore/001 Universal is a must do!Do yourself a favour and purchase the express pass for an extra $50/001 you skip the cues and makes for a much better day.One of the best experiences of my life.
Aditi M|None|25 April 2017|Cool way to spend a day|4|C51122F1145ACC3E6F0D8644B5DB1523|A great way to spend a day if you are a movie buff and love rides and shows. Great shows from transformers/001 water world. the mummy and Jurassic park. Fun parade and dancers with all kinds of movie memorabilia including how a movie is made. Great for kids too with Madagascar/001 Shrek/001 Sesame Street.Take the express tickets if possible as else the long lines can be a blooper.
Jeremy F|Cwmbran- United Kingdom|25 April 2017|A good day out at universal Studio's|4|08BAF1BB8C575E459D97080682827013|A good day had by all. Plenty of rides for all ages. Different themed areas such as Jurassic Park/001 Egypt etc. Some of the Rollercoasters were particularly good and thrilling. Plenty of places to eat including a 50's style American Diner. Film shows and parades. We spent the full day at Universal and there was just enough to keep us entertained. Prices vary depending where you obtain your tickets. You can expect to pay around 75 Sg Dollars on the day although we managed to get them for 60 beforehand. Shop around for the best price. There are other attractions on Sentosa Island but Universal is probably the most popular for tourists. Queue's for the ride's can be very long ( up to an hour) so get there early to get on the best one's. You can get a Fast Pass to all ride's for which you have to pay extra. Well worth a visit if you have children.
Silvanus A|Jakarta- Indonesia|24 April 2017|Happy Place|5|934F3F9CCD407DE3D50331A746A7A9D7|A very good/001 happy/001 and nice themes park. My family very enjoy this place and i think Transformer show is vey good.
indianfoodlover2015|Pune- India|24 April 2017|Revisit your childhood|5|3A90DE07A1CA6B516407BE380580C486|Firstly/001 this review was way overdue because my visit was in May last year. We hit this place during May 2016 and we timed our visit to a little before the local school holidays and therefore we did not have to wait long in queue for almost all the rides. A day is not enough if you intend to make full use of the place. If you are planning only a day visit/001 suggest you do a survey beforehand online and pinpoint the rides and shows you wish to go to. As you enter/001 if you go left/001 you start with Madagascar zone and if you go right/001 you start with Hollywood. Considering that we had a senior citizen and two kids with us/001 we had to be very/001 very selective. Out of the seven zones/001 we could spend time only on four zones and had to miss out on the other three. Most of the rides are fun but some are very intense so do proceed with caution. Almost all zones have restaurants so food is not a worry.
Kullacha C|None|24 April 2017|Great fun!!!|5|51CA865AA0D98108B3D412406269B9A9|I had a great time here. There are many theme parks including Jurassic park/001 ancient Egypt/001 Madagasga/001 Far far away (Shrek). All are well-organized. This place suit for everyone.
Thanneer|Singapore- Singapore|24 April 2017|A great place for the family|4|45BF8C00034C4780B4D23EEC674B2CA4|I have avoided going to the Universal Studios for fear of being overwhelmed by the crowd and for the fact that I'm not keen on roller-coasters. So/001 finally my organization gave free tickets for employees and subsidized tickets for family members/001 we decided to go. I was wrong on both my initial assumptions. We decided to cover USS clockwise so we avoided the crowds and queues. And there were numerous rides and sights that we (and our 2 year old son) enjoyed/001 namely the boat ride at Madagascar/001 the 4D ride at Shrek/001 Transformers and especially Waterworld.
Tori S|Sydney- Australia|24 April 2017|Express is the best!|4|81F2CFAC94822F1E3466B702C3354B61|Look out for cheap tickets online and make sure you pay extra to get the express pass.Get there early (as in/001 before it opens) because queues to enter the park start forming really early.We were at the front so when the gates opened we were first in line for the rides. My tip would be to only use the express pass if the wait for a ride is 10+minutes. Otherwise just line up and use the express pass later in the day when you want to go on the ride for a second time. That's what we did and it meant that we got to go on every ride twice without lining up.My second tip is to make sure you do the Cyclon rollercoaster first (it's the most extreme ride in the park) because the lines are huge later in the day. Even if you have the express pass it is still a 45min wait.Drink plenty of water as some of the lines get really hot and don't wear loose shoes because they make you take them off for some of the rides.
Wendy W|Hong Kong- China|23 April 2017|Better than Expected|4|E8BD0C826D550ADE4E4F070707FCABC9|Much better than expected! It was my first time visiting Universal Studio in Singapore and we had so much fun! There are a good variety of restaurants located inside and outside of the Universal Studio. The shops and restaurants inside are clean and the staffs are quite friendly. We waited for about 30 to 40 minutes for each ride and it wasn't too bad at all. The lines for the rides are quite structured. And they set up normal line/001 express line and single rider line (to fill up empty seats). The new transformer ride (indoor; 4D) is fun! Must try!
Raja Joko M|None|23 April 2017|Some People Treated it Like Legoland. Take Picture at Its Landmark without Entering It|4|C3B3ED7D9A21F854CE3655A35D9698E0|What I mean is... some people came only to take photos near the Globe written Universal on it. What do you call it? Landmark of USS? Whatever. I am one of them. :D we visited on May 2016 and April 2017. Only to take pictures and take a look around/001 without entering it.
bkweeks2|Perth|23 April 2017|Loads of fun|5|3017F58D471D6C96E6C0C7AB5DC1D3D4|Have been to Universal Studios on Sentosa twice now and both times we've had a blast. Big enough to take up a day but not too big that it's overwhelming. Some fantastic rides (smoothest roller coasters I've ever been on). A definite on the "to do" list if you plan on visiting Sentosa. Both times we have purchased Unlimited Express Passes. We visited mid week and found it not to be too busy/001 however if you're a thrill seeker and want to hit the more popular rides more than once then I would recommend spending that bit extra on the Express Pass to skip the queues.
101kirim|None|23 April 2017|Get the express pass|5|E6111EA4C3C395DA52FDBFAF6D30329F|Very busy park/001 but we had the express pass so we got to skip all the queues. It was worth the extra money for the pass as we got to go on all the rides multiple times.
Shaun P|None|23 April 2017|Worth a look|5|42D098B599D12124EB4E3A79DD47F8BA|The park is a lot smaller than Universal in Florida. It's got some great rides there. I wasn't in the queue that long for each ride. The longest was about 50 mins and that was for Transformers. There's plenty of places to eat. Very hot and humid was the only problem. If your used to it then it's ok but being from the UK is something out of my comfort zone.
hedger9uk|Kota Kinabalu|23 April 2017|Great day out!|5|10E7962DA8D7588A7449E0E34D9F1026|Arrived early around 9.30am and queue was already forming. You can get cheaper tickets from Travel agents and not at the park itself. The unlimited access pass to all rides is an extra sg$80 per person or for a 1 time access pass to each ride is sg$50.00. Great place for kids and even adults. A Lot to do to keep you entertained for hours. Transformers 4d show was really good and good to go in although everyone runs to the roller coasters first up so I worked my way round clockwise and pretty much had no queuing time for anything until the roller coasters. Jurassic park opens at 11am so enough time to get there. Food was pretty bad inside the park so eat a full breakfast before going although you can get stamped out and eat outside and then come in again. If you get an mrt there is a free train ride to the main entrance!
Phillip S|None|23 April 2017|Great place to fill in a day|5|09331DF1399E3F7D1ED722EC3293103F|Arrived 10am left at 4pm and it wasnt long enough . From the shops to the food to the rides my daughter and I had a ball . We could have stayed there for days . Good on ya Universal Studios - Singapore thanks for a great day
ronrmrz|New York City- New York|23 April 2017|Express Pass is Worth It|5|850974F02DE66504FC0A58EC32C1F7D5|This is the first Universal Studios that I have visited and we finished all the rides in half a day due to our express pass. Most queues are 30-50 minutes long and rides are mostly under 10 minutes. If you are visiting the park just for a day or even less/001 but the express pass because it would help you enjoy the park better. The best rides for me are transformers and the mummy.
Wendy B|None|23 April 2017|Something for everyone |5|5372259844CCF60BABAD4D91773DA2E9|Love Universal Studios! This was my second visit to Universal Singapore and it did not disappoint. There were new rides included too!It does get very busy from Friday to Sunday/001 especially over Saturday and Sunday/001 so I would highly recommend getting in early (opens at 10am). If you can afford to/001 I recommend buying the express pass. There are two types available/001 one to enjoy unlimited rides and another to enjoy one ride per attraction. I would recommend the latter/001 it is cheaper ($40ea) and there are so many rides you won't necessarily get time yo do them twice. You save so much time not having to stand in lines which can have a wait of anything from 45min to 2 hours!We bought our Universal tickets as a package (with a additional day to enjoy over 19 activities on the island on day two) and then got the express pass at the entrance itself.You will need to take some extra spending for drinks and food/001 not to mention to buy some mementos from the many novelty stores available. Also/001 don't forget the sunscreen/001 it can get pretty hot in Singapore... and if it does be sure to ride the Jurassic Park rapids ride which will certainly cool you off.My top 3 favorite rides include:TransformersJurassic Park rapidsBattlestar Galactica Human
Nitesh T|None|23 April 2017|Brilliant trip a must see adventure. |4|EEAC89ACAF53C0EB0C982D405750FD21|Went with my young family. Everyone had a blast. Long waiting times. We bought the express tickets which made the day so much more fun. I can't imagine waiting in the queues for 40 minutes for each ride.
Rajeswar V|None|22 April 2017|Amazing Experience!!! |5|F8FED61DC674A3E16D506C19A99A74E3|Keep one full day if not 2 to cover the whole Sentosa Island. Universal studios have some normal rides and some fantastic shows and rides.. don't miss Tranformers experience and water world show. Depending on the rush at that point of time/001 it is advisable to take premium pass .. advantage of this pass is not only it saves time at long queues/001 one can go for repeat rides and shows using this as many times as you want. We enjoyed repeat for Transformers ride as we liked it a lot and also to some other rides depending on kids demands. :) Lots of eateries available and so food is not a problem . People with big pockets can even venture to the casino. Overall/001 it was just awesome time spent there.
DaBene|Jakarta- Indonesia|22 April 2017|Good rides but bad service and infrastructure|3|81D98937E4B0679C52EBD274082B912F|Went there on a weekday.About 200+ people were queuing for 30 minutes at the ticket counter as only two booths (four clerks) were open. Request to open further booths was left unanswered.Note: You will save a lot of time if you buy the express pass (but beware it does not apply to all attractions)Rides were fun. Especially Mummy/001 Galaktika and Transformers. Waterworld show was cancelled as it started to rain (given high ticket prices something that park management definitely want to fix by either offering a discount or voucher or by modifying infrastructure).It was also the rain that highlighted the park's major shortcoming. Once it starts/001 you are stuck wherever you are. No transport/001 no covered walkways. Only option is to buy a S$ 39 umbrella (!) or a S$ 5 cape both of which will leave your lower body exposed while wading through the elements.You will find many food choices. Qualitatively/001 none rise above average (except for price tags which approach the zone of usury).Better management and customer focus would make this a fun experience.
Cindy R|Metro Manila- Philippines|22 April 2017|Hot day in USS|3|568FE2A794A603828D21A8469C3F564D|Hot Hot Hot - cover yourself with sunblock/001 bring umbrellas and ponchos for kids/001 wear comfy shoes!! Food is your average amusement park food. Cylon ride is ca-ray-zee!! only for the thrill seekers- or try "human" ride for humans. Loved the Mummy ... Downside is there is no Harry Potter Park. And no Minions either.
Ray A|None|22 April 2017|One of the best places in Singapore in my opinion|5|586897B44527808ECC562CE3AAC1DE40|Well worth the money. You can go into the rides as many times as you want/001 and I took advantage of it. The transformer ride is FANTASTIC. The Cylon rollercoaster too/001 very scary. Then there's the mummy rollercoaster. This one was even scarier to me because it was DESIGNED to be scary! Jumpscares/001 steep falls/001 and unlike other rollercoasters/001 you can't even see what's going to happen! The place is very well themed too. There was this one place that was themed after how western countries looked like a few centuries ago/001 and they nailed it. It looked as if we actually traveled through time. The only thing missing were a few people in coats and suites with a smoking pipe in their mouths. Fantastic.If you've got a free day/001 then I'd recommend you to come here. You will not regret it.
Teguh S|None|22 April 2017|Universal Studios Singapore in March 2016|4|E7FD504387C2F45FAF8D2F19AE43F6AC|Like Dufan in Jakarta City Indonesia/001 but more clean/001 large/001 neat/001 and complete for enjoying the game/001 will be visit again for next trip to Singapore
SHARIFAH_HANIM|Johor Bahru- Malaysia|21 April 2017|Never regret |5|E740C822FFC88596F033D9A32063BE7E|I've been there three times.. everything is full of fun.. sure i will right back ....plsease don't miss the show at the lost word
Bryan F|None|21 April 2017|Wow and then disappointing.|2|60A5406FC4165BCE288D4CD2E357719F|Firstly place is amazing and first thoughts are wow! But one ride had delays to begin with which I can understand happens even the second ride having delays in the same day its kinda just bad luck but still annoying. Then when you go to get your stuff out of locker knowing you need to take cards and doesnt have to be cash you would expect it to work. Well it doesnt/001 had to rush around at closing time finding atm to get cash out and employee we approached for help had no idea what we were on about. So overall loved the place but man they need to sort their s@*t out.
Adrian S|Colombo- Sri Lanka|21 April 2017|The best theme park in South Asia!|5|809A0B9C4E2498C83B6920A7195A2731|Universal Studios Singapore offers pretty much your childhood fantasises coming true. All the rides are thrilling and you can take your kids to most of them. You can even buy food and souvenirs from Universal Studios - quite expensive though!I would recommend you to buy a no queue pass/ fast lane ticket so that you can go to the rides asap. Otherwise you'll just be standing in the queues and will not be able to go on a ride.
Jo A|Sydney- Australia|21 April 2017|Great day.|4|A0A9A3617C7437988D472E6314C78A48|An awesome theme park better than anything in Australia. Rides were awesome but closed when there was a storm .
Namrata M|Gurugram (Gurgaon)- India|21 April 2017|Back to Childhood again...|5|5379CFC3D534D45D55AF49F86CB631BB|The theme park is excellent and a must visit in Singapore. The park has been well planned and the rides are lot of fun. Lot of attractions and activities along the way. All rides are a must visit. Do reach the park early to be able to view the entire stretch. Would surely come back with lot of memories.
NP N|None|21 April 2017|Fantastic |5|92422F434D03478EA62068590E5B0A12|Clean and well organized Wish they monitored better as some cut through queue and the ones waiting get treated unfairly naturally Yet excellent atmosphere
Hakeem Y|None|21 April 2017|Very fun|5|64656951CEA0656C5A8313964D59AE20|The employees there are very polite and friendly. They are also very knowledgeable about each ride. They are very good at helping customers who needs help. They always try to help their customers.
sarahe2703|None|21 April 2017|Great day|4|3CEEEFF731633657AC360682E9772D0A|So many fun rides especially love the red roller coaster and the dragon roller coaster. Definitely recommend it.
lynorap|Sydney- Australia|21 April 2017|Fun day|5|5DF90F25372A4D9F51B3D7C86CDC24B0|Universal was great fun not as big as I thought it would be. Buy your express tickets makes life so much easier. Get there early and you can do it all in a day.
Corinne S|Battaramulla- Sri Lanka|21 April 2017|Wonderful Attraction!|5|13F1F8DFBB2E2FC49DB8182C2F43468A|This was the first attraction that me and my family (3 of us) visited. We booked through the hotel (Mandarin Orchard) which cost us S$74 per person without transfers. When we got there it was noon and we were in time to see the Sesame Street Live show. It was great. Even we adults enjoyed it. Thereafter we went on the rides. The battle starts Galactica roller coaster was awesome. But to get to it there was a very long queue and we would have had to wait closer upon an hour. It was a holiday the day we went. However/001 I suggest that you take the express ticket so that you could enjoy all the attractions within Universal Studios and get there in the morning. By waiting in the queue/001 we missed quite a few. The other rides we went on were the canopy flyer/001 Madagascar: a crate adventure (it was fun) and Jurassic Park Rapids. The Lost World rock climb too was fantastic/001 if you manage to make it to the top. Overall it was a fantastic day and we enjoyed it thoroughly.
jaddyb0y|Bengaluru- India|20 April 2017|An Amazing experience!!|5|4405573A658A0EA41F7BE090660D092F|This place is full of exciting rides and attractions. My favorites were the Galatica transformers roller coster/001 the 7D rides/001 the Mummy returns/001 the dance performances/001 the crackers blasted at the end etc. It is a great place for kids above 4-5 yrs as well!!The only concern is the long queues unless you can afford the VIP pass. Another couple of Tips would be to not do the Universal Studios and Sentosa Island in 1 day/001 it's impossible. Also/001 do not buy the magnets from here/001 as you would get the same and cooler ones at the $1 Market!!
rcsdev|Mumbai (Bombay)- India|20 April 2017|Fanrastic theme park enjoyed a lot|5|80F1B48D33148E285C8C49B69D2C876A|One must reach as early as possible and should avoid week end days the timings are 10 to 7 we have finished almost all the attractions. Enjoyed a lot family is very happy some of the attractions like revenge of the mummy and jurasik park has unforgettable experience
KiddySing|Singapore|20 April 2017|Fun for all ages|5|239A0B9DB6025EA7E2C264F83E503E4A|This is a must visit. You just feel happy when you come here. There are activities for all ages. My 80 year old mum had fun! The rides range from mild to exhilarating. Set aside at least half a day to experience the place.
Gemma B|Christchurch- New Zealand|20 April 2017|The Best Attraction on Sentosa|5|0F2F008E5EE6DC8B56FEE004AF317532|Definitely the best attraction on Sentosa! Just watch the weather. The roller coasters are shut down if there is lightening. Great fun for all ages. Get an express pass so you don't have to queue! We had a blast!
Kay D|None|20 April 2017|Fun fun fun|5|CF0843CB9805151FDA3F489554248D2F|First time at Universal. Went there with our tickets bought online which I think is much cheaper than buying it there and will save you a lot of time. We went there 10 am which is their opening hour which I recommend since line from queue is still short. While it was scorching hot when we visited. I must say that I enjoyed The Mummy/001 Transformers/001 Battlestar Galactica/001 a must ride for adults. I tried exchanging my local currency to Sgd and rates are way higher when you do it there. Just walk a few steps to Resorts World they also have money changer there. :)
Paige8886|Sydney|20 April 2017|Great rides but very crowded |4|02737472ED7E060A065942B03FFCDCAB|We came here with our 2 children (3 and 5) for the second time. It is expensive to get in and expensive to eat and drink once inside. The kids loved the Sesame St show. It was really crowded and we ended up buying an express pass which cost another $60 each. This helped us get on a few rides with no waiting. Great place but expect to spend a lot of money!
Theworldexplorer12|Singapore- Singapore|20 April 2017|The best place for a fun adventure!|5|008C8A742B72C9BC1576B7396B1C139F|This is a No.1 must in Singapore! Suitable for the young and old/001 I highly recommend this place for all tourists. Even though there will be queues/001 a special pass can be bought to get to the front of the line without waiting. I guarantee that you will have a fun and awesome time!
mblewis2017|Sydney- Australia|20 April 2017|Family Holiday|4|CF2AD884057FE36D4B4EA4F59A10D5D6|Stayed at Swissotel Merchant Court at Clarke Quay. Went to Sentosa Island via MRT to Harbourtown and then $4.00 pp for a tramride to Sentosa Island. Took approx 20 min.Arrived before opening 9.45ish. Pre-printed ticket bought online from main website/001 easy access... made a bee line for the Transformers ride no queue then onto Mummy Ride (not for the faint hearted extreme roller coaster in the dark) and then Jurassic Ride which was my children's favourite (aged 10 & 8). The Jurassic section doesn't open until 11.00am but we were there at the opening and managed to get on the ride straight away. After that we cruised through the other lands 4D Shrek show was great. Food wasn't great but not allowed to take in food or drink. Husband enjoyed the fruit cup. They have water stations/fans everywhere including in the waiting line for rides. Overall a fun day out with the kids/001 were done by 2.00pm. We then visited Candylicious outside of Universal for an ice cream. Then onto Trick Eye Museum... was quiet at the beginning however near the end was hectic with lots of people entering after leaving Universal I'm guessing. Made it hard to take some good photos. Kids loved Trick Eye.
KrazeeeL|None|20 April 2017|Fun|3|F74C342E5582CAD37484D29721C5FA86|Not a bad theme park. Not that many rides. Make sure you get here early to avoid the queues which can be up to an hour or 2 wait
DeonGovenderDj|Durban- South Africa|20 April 2017|Waiting for rides can make you get old.|2|841D74501D5A802E2D15D07E0CBE22BC|So I got here one hour before the first ride which was transformers/001 the wait was over 70 mins/001 in fact I'm writing this while in the queue. If you want to waste time and maybe watch a movie on your mobile then do the normal pass/001 otherwise pay $50 per person and skip the queue. I bought that pass after but trust me/001 don't wait in queues/001 the day will pass by and you won't enjoy it.
Pradina K|None|20 April 2017|wonderful place|5|6B590E507A03599F3FEC90E55A45BA95|you will need a whole day to explore this place. everything is great/001 every place is wonderful. i'm not trying everything since the queue just so long/001 but i had a great time. a lot of spot for photo stop tough LOL
Linlin X|None|20 April 2017|good place can spend a whole day  even not enough!|5|10A4FDBD17E524ED7718F8DAC833A3A6|good place can spend a whole day/001 even not enough! similar with other universal studios/001 BUT has a "transformers" theme park/001 which is my kids' favorate. We met Optimus Prime and Bumble Bee!!!
ilovedisneytravel|None|20 April 2017|Great fun|5|E32917E51C54D28B85E95EF75503BC91|We went on a Wednesday and had a great time. We stayed until closing time and found wait times around 5pm was only about 5mins for lots rides. We managed to do Transformers ride 3 times that way. Very cool park
BikerBird|Berkshire|20 April 2017|Ticks all the boxes|5|0039FA2A9923727673573478F828EFE4|Busy so needless to say/001 if you can afford it/001 buy the queue jumping tickets! It's not the biggest theme park but you'll easily do it in a day!
raaaziz|None|20 April 2017|Great but waiting times!!!|4|F0C233FEA7324EA242EC3D50F59B2C49|As our hotel was close to harbourfront station/001 we made our way up to the top following signs for the sentosa line and purchased our tickets at the top and bordered the monorail. Quick and easy way to access sentosa island and then universal studios onwards. The studios itself is great with plenty of rides (although many of which are aimed towards children). A lot of the main bigger rides had long waiting times (some even having waiting times up to 90 minutes!). Few places to eat inside as well as some souvenir/gift shops. Overall/001 a good day out as there are plenty of other things to also do on sentosa island including the beaches. Just be wary with the weather as if there are thunderstorms/001 we were advised that the studios may be closed.
Ferdiantono L|None|19 April 2017|Nice theme park in SEA.|4|0BD267E7B611EE7EB0E4D2611F0C9D98|Can't expect more than this/001 probably the best theme park in SEA at the moment.I tried the Dragon roller coaster/001 Madagascar carousel/001 Shrek show/001 Egyptian ride and more. Everything is pretty decent. They have shops selling souvenirs/001 food and beverages inside so make sure to bring extra cash.
Daryl S|London|19 April 2017|Not for hardcore rollercoaster enthusiasts but a great day out|4|2B4792D4B1CBA413781AD99C54602F01|Had an excellent day here with my partner who is not the biggest fan of massive rollercoasters.The park is excellent/001 relatively small compared to US counterparts and many key rides and themes missing in my opinion. Luckily there are still some really enjoyable rides/001 great opportunities to meet characters and do all the fun things that is a day out a an amusement park.The food in the park is lacking/001 not many options and the options are not well presented or particularly good quality. It is very hard to get anything which could pass as healthy which doesn't look 'sad'.It is very easy to do this park in a day and I would strongly suggest getting the fast pass as it means that you can avoid waiting and leave the park on a high without ever having to wait more than maybe 15mins at the peak times if you go on a week day that is not a school holiday.

Ravi L|Hyderabad- India|18 April 2017|An awesome amusement park|5|4DB8BF670698144CE41893B17295712D|The place is filled with some of the most amazing rides one can ever think of. The Transformer/001 The Mummy/001 The Roller Coasters you name it. An awesome experience worth each and every penny. DONT by mistake also ever visit here on a Weekend as you may end up wasting a lot of time queuing up for the rides. Do not miss the shows here. An amazing water fights show is the highlight of Universal Studio. And has some amazing restaurants also. Must must must visit place.
GSBennett|Chiang Rai Province- Thailand|18 April 2017|Roller Coaster Fun for all levels|5|7D96C416CCF200B34BC29464A4E8BA3A|We enjoyed everything from the worlds best candy shop to the multiple thrill coasters. A lot of fun in a small place and you will need about 3 days to see it all. Well trained staff.
Pam O|Queensland- Australia|18 April 2017|best theme park!! |5|4B60F2772D9956A6B551E0F4862872B8|If you've never been to Singapore/001 make sure you take a day out to visit Sentosa Island/001 especially Universal Studios. You can buy discounted tickets through travel websites like GoVoyagin/001 there are special bundle ticket options available to visit multiple attractions on Sentosa & maximise your fun; this visit we purchased a double for Universal Studios & S.E.A. Aquarium. The entrances are directly across from one another/001 both are awesome attractions & there is something for everyone. The instructions to redeem the tickets on the confirmation email were perfect/001 but when we tried to print our passes at the Universal Studios self help kiosk the printers weren't working so to avoid that I recommend going directly to Guest Services (which for USS is hidden directly behind the yellow ticket boxes where general public line up) and they will print your tickets for you and all is good. Pass outs are available any time the attractions are open/001 so what we do if the heat & the wait lines to go on rides becomes too much/001 is escape to the Aquarium & into the air con to wind down & enjoy watching the marine life in the huge aquarium. I recommend for Universal Studios to either turn up right on 10am/001 or wait until after 1pm (which still gives you 6 hours) if you want to avoid long wait lines. Anyway this bundle is great value for money/001 we searched for many offers and this one was good value/001 easy and undeniably the best combo pick for Sentosa.Also/001 check the website for any ride closures. And if you want to save cash on the food offerings at USS/001 there are cheaper food outlets like macdonalds/001 texas chicken & many different asian diners & restaurants outside the park in rwsentosa.
