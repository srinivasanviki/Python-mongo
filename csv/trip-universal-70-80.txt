Keep the following in mind.Even if u have a travel agent booking/001 very worthwhile to upgrade to The Universal Express Pass for 60 SGD extra.Check out timings of shows and activities before u start out.Must plan to do the Roller coaster s /001 Egyptian mummy/001 Transformer/001 These are the top attractionsWater is available for drinking freeAmple eating places for vegetarians alsoStart early at 10am to make the most
Jessica J|None|18 April 2017|Your Happy Place in Singapore|4|38413BA036D9FC40DB5EC05B344B5D2D|Been here with my family and we really had a great time. We didn't went for the extreme rides since we have our 1 yr old son with us. The staff inside especially the ones who are in character are very accommodating. we really enjoy the guys who dance on the street/001 i heard some of the people called them "Streeboys". Everybody is very warm. Truly a one happy place to visit in Singapore.
Lisabug1964|New Zealand|18 April 2017|Awesome day out!|5|72AE01FD54AA7AC9FCFAE9B58D9CD002|I thoroughly enjoyed my day out at Universal Studios! Best advice I can give is to get an unlimited front of line pass. Although this may cost a bit more/001 it is well worth it/001 as you will not be in lines for hours ( yes in busy times it can be that long) and there are many rides you will want to take over and over again. I found the 3D Transformers ride to be the best I have ever experienced. The Jurassic Park ride was great to cool down ( you will get very wet lol) and the Mummy was yet another scary one.There are plenty of places to sit and rest/001 plenty of eateries of differing types/001 huge amounts of merchandise at good prices ( not too expensive) and lots of etertainment around the place. All in all/001 a fantastic day.
Sam W|None|17 April 2017|Its good for its price|4|3C48C1536F580D1030F17518679BB3DB|Not too overpriced.Some rides remain as top attractions like:TransformerMummyBattle Star GalacticaSurprised to see that park is not over packed at Easter.Only the kiddie rides have a bigger queue.Kinda tiny Need some expantion though.
karthikeyan_nadar|Chennai (Madras)- India|17 April 2017|excellent for family|4|94D8940E04F719A7529813CAFB641599|every one in our family enjoyed . but make sure you dont go on weekends. its always better to buy express tickets even on weekdays/001 otherwise you have to wait for min 30min to 60min on weekdays. if going with kids hire a stroller at the entrance. food and drinks are costly.
Razia C|None|17 April 2017|Be at the opening !|4|C0721598916BAB3D849B764CC5E1A22B|We read the reviews of others and we were prepared ! 1st we did on a Monday with no vacation in Singapore to set the stage. You need to be there at the opening and do the most popular attractions like Transformers/001 Battlestar galactica and Mummies. From 11:00/001 queues are just awful even on a Monday. If you do not do that or it is weekend/001 take the express pass option (30 dollars single turn/001 50 dollars unlimited). Queues will ruin your day. But in that case/001 i do not know if it is worth the overall price. Waiting time given for attractions is underestimated (multiply by min 1.5 or 2). In one day (8 hours) we did everything and kids enjoyed the time spent.Attractions are nice/001 overall experience good. We managed even to eat something other than fries which could be a challenge.
Shobhit1211|Pune- India|17 April 2017|Attraction is "Transformers" ride|5|1BD24C49D036E4A9DEA0946B39FDD48A|Universal Attraction is one of best place to visit . What i felt the best attraction was Transformers ride. Famous Universal Studio is 1 day trip sufficient in singapore . Some rides was not available due to maintenance
TravelwithPooja|New Delhi- India|17 April 2017|Must visit |5|D7EC5A7A53BCA7AE0595EE451E18EA58|Awesome entertainment for all age groups. My 5 year old went ballistic. Wear comfortable shoes. Don't miss the transformers ride and the Steven Spielberg show. Loved the Jurassic park ride. Unlimited express card a must if you plan to visit many attractions.
Samantha C|None|17 April 2017|Fun Fun Fun|4|D12F75006084CDDE4509D6FD2520D966|We had a great time at Universal Studios when we were in Singapore. The line was extremely long to get in (approx.10am) however it went reasonably fast. Next time I would pay more to get the express pass for some of the rides/001 as the lines were very long. Food was good/001 staff were friendly and overall we had a great day! Transformers ride was definitely #1
JJ22Toronto|Toronto|17 April 2017|Fun day with lots of shade|5|8E29CFA47673EE553C94D993E0FA9111|We visited on a hot sunny day and were pleasantly surprised by how much shade there was in the park and how cool the waiting areas were. We did not purchase a fast-pass and only endured long waits for the Enchanted Airways junior roller coaster (not worth it for the short ride) and Jurassic Park Rapids (worth it- the line moves quicker than you would expect and no/001 you don't need to invest in a rain poncho). If you are one of the first to exit the Shrek 4D experience then you may not have to wait in line for the Magic Potion Ferris wheel ride inside the store. Everyone's favorite ride (5y-43y) was Transformers. Revenge of the Mummy is not for the faint of heart. The Sesame Spaghetti Space Chase was a cutest ride. Starbot cafe was the coolest restaurant and was the best place to enjoy molecular ice-cream. This was easily done in a day/001 probably half-day if investing in a fast-pass.
Saifur T|Dhaka City- Bangladesh|17 April 2017|Nice place to spend a day with kids  nothing more nothing less.|5|16F93A57D77CCD381336373405D3EE9F|Whatever we assumed/001 it was nothing like that/001 It is quite a fun place for the kids. After the expensive entry you can enjoy the rides. But the staffs are very rude and their attitudes was not friendly and entertaining.Quite colorful place. Where and when some shows will be going on/001 it was not mentioned somewhere properly. I think it was not good value of our money.
A-Platypus|None|17 April 2017|Definitely worth the money!|5|8B2343A9E2BF64089E012000ABC40FE3|If you're in Singapore/001 this theme park is a must-see. It has different attractions (sci-fi/001 shrek/001 ancient egypt/001 jurassic world/001 etc.) and not only kids can enjoy this place/001 adults will also definitely will. They have numerous rides per attraction and gift shops as well. Their humongous architectural structures are also a must-see (especially in ancient egypt).
LeChad13|Adelaide- Australia|17 April 2017|Lights camera action|5|2243CE6E7FAE7D625731D70F1857CA41|Get there early. I found this place exceed all my expectations. We went and stood in line for the gates to open/001 this was a good move as we rode the big attraction rides with no line. Through out the day we had no drama getting around and finding food. We saw a show/001 that was great/001 and took in all the movie back drops.
dn133|London- United Kingdom|16 April 2017|A wonderful place|5|3D63ED2A36472B91546111812543F80D|Universal Studios is one of the best attractions in Singapore. There are so many rides for both children and adults. This place is magical and I definitely recommend it. Absolutely fantastic!!!
ajay b|None|16 April 2017|excellent|5|F8D2394E84F23A3BB390361AA8D773D6|superb... but not for small childrens below 5 years as all the rides r not suitable for them.. but for others its superb/001/001 if it is crowded then go in for universal express ticket which wil cost u 50$ extra.. u don't have to wait much in line for games.. u can save time.. roller coaster/001 water world /001 lost world etc etc all r excellent.. a must visit for all...
viju_77|Pune- India|16 April 2017|Universal studios|5|A572C15DB389D0DFDACBB0DBCC0BEBD6|A place where you need atleast whole day to see what Singaporeans have done. It well crowed e·∏ç all the time and hence lot of preparation is required to get maximum out of the visit first get the map/001 them se the programme as to what is happening and where. Then chalk out the foot travel from place to place including food needs. Children can have wonderful time if you plan it well you can also visit the marine life across which also needs 5/6 hours this can beca London day indeed I thoroughly enjoyed my visit/001 every thing is so professional/001 well planned wel rehearsed and very very entertaining.
Sarah C|Cairns|16 April 2017|Amazing!|5|BD6A5CF69BFDED03839EF28473FC3639|We went and visited universal studios. We also paid for the express passes for the rides. It was a great investment! All the rides were 40 min waits and we got on immediately. The rides were well maintained/001 cleaned and good safety standards. Worth taking the kids down.
Ambeaw K|None|16 April 2017|The worst Universal Singapore  don't visit  waste time and money   staffs are unpolite  guest service is very bad.|1|30CA06308B0CD7BE7A685BB774A1D6C6|We buy 6 tickets for the whole family but worthless for our money. The staff is very bad /001 not polite to the guests. It seems that we come here for free admission. We have to wait for 2 hours until our queue/001 the machine is out of order. We have to be new queue when it starts working. Again when it is raining/001 stopping for raining /001 we must stand a new queue again and again. When it is raining/001 no umbella/001 no staff/001 no way to go to restroom. No staff helping at Taxi stop outside. The guest service desk at universal should have duty to help the customer but she is not polite and cannot help anything/001 just say that nonrefundable/001 everyone must be in queue and it has more 4 hours before they will be closed/001 we have time to play more and we should accept term and condition in ticket. You should write the condition in the ticket that which machine is out of order and waiting time is at least 2 hours per machine. We pay 6 pax tickets but get nothing/001 unfair for tourists. I will write 100 bad reviews to this Universal Singapore. The Singapore Universal is the bad universal in the world.
Rablett|Cape Town- South Africa|16 April 2017|Amazing day out! Single rider  not express!|5|6C62CB17AC4D5C25BD8415843F10A194|Arrived at 9.30ish with tickets in hand and was about 5 or 6 people back in our specific line (There are about 6 lines). By 10 when it opened there were a good 30+ people per line. We went in and straight to the dueling roller coasters/001 no line what so ever on either. We then went to transformers.... 30 min wait. Not ideal but okay. After that a lot of the bigger rides had a 25-35 min wait so we started looking at express pass/001 but after seeing in a tripadvisor post that it was 60 dollars pp we decided to rather try "single rider" option and boy was this a game changer!! Went on about 4 rides single rider style. So you don't get to sit with your friend/wife/family/001 BUT we waited on average 5 min when the lines were often 30 or even 40 min long. GAME CHANGER as long as you dont have young kids. Just do it and thank me later :) only other thing is take your own water/001 we didn't and its pricey in there at between 3.50 and up to 6 dollars at some spots.
Suphaporn r|Bangkok- Thailand|16 April 2017|Fun park for family|4|9064AC0089627D8A652E98762C52A265|I visited the USS during the week days which has many people but not wait for long time for the queue. The restaurants in side the USS should have more staffs. It takes one full day enough to play all the things. The overall is good. So this is one of the place if you come to Singapore you should visit USS.
Courtney R|None|16 April 2017|Love Love Love!|5|8354C4A2393A5BF36788156163451CBB|Loved universal studios was a fantastic place to visit for kids and adults lots of fun rides for everyone and activities though out the day/001 it's a must see location when in Singapore!
Zainab A|Singapore- Singapore|16 April 2017|Spectacular lights display at the end of the night only on Friday & Saturday. day.|5|BD58D96B11A911861ABAFD1A51CE7974|USS Singapore is a must to visit. You should spend the whole day at this place especially if you are planning to go on the days suggested.
Harisurya|Bengaluru- India|16 April 2017|Badly managed|1|59F9F4ACFE8DCA92110EA2AE90235BDC|The attraction is badly managed. We got fun day pass but we have been made to queue at multiple locations to get tickets. The rides need upgrade as they are old themed. They had transformers which is really good. Compared to Hollywood one/001 this is not enticing to take rides. Need better options. All the items inside the park is damn expensive. A pocket pop corn (not a bucket) costs 8 sgd. They loot by overpricing everything. Overall value for money is diminishing. Avoid this over crowded and over rated place!
Anjali T|None|15 April 2017|Universal Studios|5|D1479C62D11D69B7878C8AEAF056C0B4|Lovely place. But with young kid few rides cannot be enjoyed. With 5 years old we could spend entire day and enjoyed lot of rides and shows. One day is required to cover Universal Studios.
Prarthana D|None|15 April 2017|Fun and light|5|6742F9B697D5D0BAC24348FFE2CF2302|A fun experience for both adults as well as children. There are enough attractions to keep all age groups busy.
FMSHK|Hong Kong- China|15 April 2017|Great environment and facilities  untrustworthy staff|2|2E832CCD2A19873E8AC6D64806BC83EE|The park itself is lovely/001 great rides and it's a great place for people of all ages. However/001 the staff really let us down and ruined what would have been a wonderful day.Upon entering/001 staff approached us to inform us about an Easter promotion where to win/001 guests had to look out for staff wearing a special badge. We found one of those staff who congratulated us on being the first to win a chocolate hamper and to post a photo on Facebook in order to collect the prize. After doing that/001 we went to collect the prize but the staff there told us there was no chocolate at all and just a key ring. This was disappointing but not a big deal. The real problem was how we were treated - the staff laughed at us as if we were stupid for even asking about chocolate. So we went back to the staff at the entrance who originally told us about the promotion to ask for clarification on the prizes/001 and their answers went from "I don't know" to "there is supposed to be chocolate" - they couldn't give a simple yes or no answer. So then we then went to Guest Services to complain about how unclear this promotion was. We were served by Miki/001 who when we explained what had happened/001 she openly laughed as us to our faces. It was only after we said we were insulted by her laughing at us that she made up some excuse saying the promotion was somehow funny and that she wasn't laughing at us. She also had no idea about this promotion and admitted it was the park's problem for not properly briefing staff. Although disappointing not to win anything/001 the issue we had was with the staff. They had a really bad attitude- laughing at guests/001 not offering any kind of problem resolution or even a simple apology for how we were treated. Miki then confirmed that all we could do was fill in a complaint form and that the park nor the Genting group would do anything. It really gave us the impression that they just don't care about their guests.I would still recommend visiting Universal Studios as it is a fun day out but I would strongly advise not to bother speaking to staff about any kind of promotion as they have no clue as to what's going on/001 and rather than trying to help/001 they just laugh at you. It would be great if management at Universal Studios could provide training for staff on how to properly handle complaints rather than treating their guests like idiots.
Ashley C|Sydney- Australia|15 April 2017|Fun day out!... GET THE FAST PASS|5|8D0CB53B6C25689813C268F21FBEDEC5|Make sure you go online to get the best rate... prices range a lot. We got 2 people for $120. And then got the fast pass tickets when we got there. High key recommend doing this. We saved over &100!
21jithinb|None|15 April 2017|Great day !!|4|EAD40F1DB471AFD01D80395E4DA66854|Sentosa Island/001 Singapore is must visit place . Great experience !! Only pros is the hot climate expect that very good experience.
Sanchita S|India|15 April 2017|A good place to be with family|4|4519921664F312BD0F127BC06C869AD9|For sure this is a full day activity in your itenerary. The place is divided into several theme areas. The entrance of Univeral studio greets you with a huge globe and a fountains to soothe you. The huge gate of the studio takes you along the streets of Hollywood/001 where you mightjust bump upon a Marlyn Monroe dressed in white and dancing around the street or hulk shaking hands with you. The huge transformer/001 7D shows and dinosaur park is amongst the famous theme areas. there is an eatery close to the egyptian area.
Sierra T|Sydney- Australia|14 April 2017|Great atmosphere  great day! |4|B7236B049E641FCE44410E16CF7FF31D|After our recent visit to Universal Studios Singapore on Tuesday/001 we would highly recommend getting the express pass. Watching the express people walk right past you while you have been waiting in the line for 45 minutes/001 really isn't fun. Whether it be weekend or weekday/001 your experience will be much better if you have the express pass. In saying this/001 the longest we had to go on the Transformers ride which was about an hour which isn't too long in the scheme of things. Definitely recommend the Cylon and Revenge of the Mummy. Lockers are free for 45 minutes and then you pay $2 for every 20 minutes. So sucks if you have waited in a line and you get charged. Therefore you should carry some money on you just in case it was to happen. Food is a little pricey/001 western and traditional options available. Overall really fun day/001 would do it again!
Nicky B|Townsville- Queensland- Australia|14 April 2017|Fantastic but you MUST get the express pass! |5|426D5ECCB9166C11AF1B537D20FC2C44|After reading reviews & advice online we decided to splash out on the unlimited express pass - and BOY were we glad we did! The place itself is amazing/001 rides (especially roller coasters) are great. Thanks to our pass we were able to get straight on to most things/001 maybe 5 minutes wait at most/001 as many times as we liked - whereas the regular queues for most rides were between 30 mins to an hour. We'd go on the same ride 3 or 4 times in less time than we'd have had to stand in line to go on once. Can't recommend that pass enough!!
scottjb29|Sydney- Australia|14 April 2017|family fun .|4|0ACEA6B829AD20A2F9E27C2830EAC792|greeted by the famous universal globe out the front which is a great photo opportunity /001the usual high prices for entry /001but I have to say when I went it was not that packed /001very easy to get on the rides /001they had all the big name rides and attractions .the action show was I think waterworld /001funnily enough was rained out /001a bit disappointing as it looked really good .it had all the theme park food and souvenirs /001an all round good family day out .
KingsOfLeon123|India|14 April 2017|What a wonderful experience!|4|931DC788D790F7A89BD4CFAD5CCAD244|We visited here in late 2015 as a part of our tour group. The rides are themed based on popular US movies like Transformers and is a good place for kids and middle aged people alike. There did not seem to be enough time to cover all the major attractions but better to just try the famous ones including battlestar galactica and not rush through. However/001 the food courts seemed very expensive even by SIngapore standard.
Johno74|Penrith- Australia|14 April 2017|Great day out|5|31C51996B8B5904AFE06AD8B63AC9CCB|We booked the VIP tour/001 and enjoyed every minute. It was expensive but our guide was outstanding and friendly. The rides were great and the actual layout of the park was much better than Universal Studios in California.
AshleyUy|Tagbilaran City- Philippines|14 April 2017|Waterworld was Impressive|4|3DB698BFE6B7F13DBD7A17E86EE3A371|This is my second time in Universal Studios Singapore and it was seeing Waterworld that made me want to leave a review. The stunts were fun/001 authentic/001 and the actors really made an effort to engage with the crowd. We weren't able to finish the show though cos they had to stop it midway but that was impressive to me. There was an oncoming storm and they didn't want to compromise the show's quality and employee safety. Definitely finishing the full show when I get the chance.
LaurieScarborough|None|14 April 2017|Not as good as Orlando but still good |4|C9B9424C4740BBF370652CB320EDD18D|It's a very small park compared to Orlando. Queues are long so expect your day of waiting. It's very hot and queuing for rides not in air con bur the occasional switched on fan! Staff on rides are quick paced so be ready to have your arm snatched to be put in the correct position for rides. The highlight of the day was getting a caricature we got black and white one it took 10 minutes and was amazing credit to Hafiz he was amazing and did it amazing as we told him we got engaged it was fantastic I hope universal appreciate his talents. It's worth a visit it would be amazing if not been to Orlando 6 months prior still worth a visit Jurassic rapids amazing and cyclon were the best rides and the water stunt show. Although my boyfriend got drenched as one of the guys came and took eye to men with hats or bald heads. He took his hat and soaked in bucket and put back on Josh's head/001 luckily he took it as a joke and the hat was ¬£35 and could've been ruined/001 put your phone away as they slash anything in blue and green seats we were sat in green splash zone and says may get wet well josh was drenched. Also if you can't be bothered waiting and not bothered sat with friends go as single riders waiting a fraction of time. Universal if you read this please praise Hafiz for his amazing effort and talent.
LOUISE D|Brisbane- Australia|14 April 2017|Buy Express Pass|4|C77C79AB4108FF0D4B5E0F4D19F84C11|Staff outside the park were wonderful as out prepurchased tickets wouldn't scan. Buy an express pass. We went on a quiet day but it is still nice to NOT wait in line. Single riders bypass the line up as well at some rides. We caught a taxi to Harbourfront/001 then Sentosa Express to US. It would have been better and cheaper to catch taxi all the way to US.
MMPGR|Shanghai- China|14 April 2017|Clean but long queues|4|704F8C3423509E081D9219199C120A4F|We have a half year pass for Universal studios so we go quite frequently. We go early and on schooldays to avoid the really long queues. The park is nicely set up and the rides are good. The food is so-so and expensive. What I find really annoying are the VIP passes (express). For double the entrance fee you can avoid the long queues. But overall a nice park for a couple of hours
Angleseateam|Anglesea|14 April 2017|Not quite the universal of elsewhere |4|78A8EF3C463487386E68B4101F2A41BC|Space limits the experience here. The lack of area means the attractions are limited. But worth the visit if a theme park is a nice addition to your break.
renataabraham|Sao Paulo- SP|14 April 2017|Nice day out!|4|47C5C423B3167E872257A6B8358FAB4F|Overall it was a very enjoyable day. The rides are awesome. No bags or loose items on pockets are allowed on the rides/001 however they do offer a free (for up to 45 minutes) locker service. The transformers ride/cinema was/001 by far/001 the best of the attractions/001 must see.
aldrinibikini|Manila- Philippines|13 April 2017|The greatest time!|5|957F1EE172C590403474065DE8B5E936|One of the best amusement parks I have ever visited! Transformers: The Ride is the best ride in the park. We were lucky because there weren't that much people when we visited. It only took us about 5-10 minutes to queue per ride. I can't wait to go back!
Amna B|Lahore- Pakistan|13 April 2017|YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE US IN YOUR SINGAPORE PLAN|5|78CFAF7CCB7AB30CAFEA8777188C567A|Best best best. Great place with alot of fun rides. great restaurants/001 shopping/001 souvenirs/001 yu will defintily enjoy there. Just keep half day for Universal Studio
Manish J|New Delhi- India|13 April 2017|Simple Wow|5|3C1A8943C2B0F0B897A9B151166A6842|Transformers/001 Revenge of the Mummy/001 Shrek 4-D Adventure/001 Madagascar- A Crate Adventure/001 Battlestar Galactica are must try rides.
Rachel H|None|13 April 2017|Loved it|5|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|A lot of reviews saying it's small but we thought it was perfect for a one day visit. The two coasters are brilliant/001 the Egyptian coaster (the Mummy) was a surprise gem and loved the Transformers simulator. Jurrasic Park water ride overrated in our opinion but you can take younger kids on it so nice family experience. Food expensive as you'd expect and can gwt really got waiting for rides ao invest in a universal express pass if you can afford it - worth its weight in gold on the day we visited! Early morning and end of day are the best time to get on the coasters when the lines shorter (as in none for the express lines!). We had loads of fun and topped the day off with some pics with characters on our way put at 6 30pm. If you want a pic with the minions hang about outside the Minions shop and jump in queue quick when the staff member announces where the queue is outside!
mitsudm|Mumbai- India|13 April 2017|Nice visit|4|EF4031BD181EDC7E6CAEF59B6D814383|The attractions / rides are good. Do visit the transformers. Its one of the best attractions they offer. We visited near xmas so decorations were good.Food is very expensive inside.Suggest that if you are from India visit Adlabs Imagica at Khopoli. I believe Imagica offers better attractions than Universal Studio.
ameyab88|Pune- India|13 April 2017|Perfect outing but long waiting!|5|59E54EFD81AF83D70A3F09DBF947273E|This place brings to life what a normal mind will think is magic! We did the Transformers ride (highly recommended but huge waiting period)/001 the Mummy ride (fun)/001 the WaterWorld live show (only 2 shows per day so make sure to free up the schedule)/001 the Jurassic Park water ride (will probably get wet but it is super fun)/001 the Jurassic Park roller coaster (fun)/001 the Donkey live show (fun) and the New York street. There was also a Battlestar Galactica ride which looked awesome and scary at the same time. Do be early to this place and rush to the Transformers ride as this ride has huge waiting times.
Jay A|None|12 April 2017|Must visit... One of the best attractions in Sungapore|5|E3618BB6C2F18850E810F76C437F3AAC|A place for people from every age group. Best Rides: Jurassic parks rapid adventures/001 Revenge of the Mummy/001 Battlestar Galactica: Cylon and TransformersTips: Reach there by 10 to avoid the queue. Buy fast access entry if visiting on weekend. If you are visiting solo/001 join the single rider queue and save a lot of time.
Paul L|Hanoi- Vietnam|12 April 2017|A day to remember!|5|03DD940309EF4BF03FF3CABBC53E68B8|If you have children or love the movies then this is a must see in Singapore. There are things to watch/001 foods to try and souvenirs to buy. The kids will love some of the rides/001 (Height and weight dependent) There is Waterworld (Who remembers that movie?) Transformers and even 50's singers in the street.

Sandra F|Phu Quoc Island- Vietnam|12 April 2017|Great Day Out|5|188EDBBE8A47E0155CD50828C20BE45C|Having never been to a Universal studio were decided while in Singapore we would go.Having grown children we could leisurely decide on what to see and do.Initially when we booked this we hadn't planned on going on any rides but the excitement got the better of us and we both relived our childhood.The rides and shows these days are amazing. With 3D and 4D they were fantastic. Our tip for anyone going who can afford it /001 buy an express ticket when you get there. My husband doesn't queue for anything and with the express ticket the maximum waiting time was about 10-15 minutes. The wait time on the boards were from 30-50 minutes. We filled in a whole day and saw all the shows we wanted to and had a great day. I found a lot of the outdoor areas had shade which meant no sun burn.
Azzawi|Dubai- United Arab Emirates|12 April 2017|Needs proper organization and signage|3|167DEB66ACE6971FD382975639123691|I must admit I thought Singapore was utopia in terms of organization. But I was totally disappointed when I got to universal studios. We were wandering around the compound looking for ticket sales to enter Universal Studios/001 we finally say a place that had a huge sign "guest services" with a long queue and only 2 of the 4 or 5 cashiers were occupied .I stood in the extremely slow queue. Observing the staff work was like watching a slow motion movie. when it was my turn and i told the gentleman what I wanted/001 he told me this queue was only for people picking up tickets. I blew my fuse and demanded that he show me where it says that on the sign. I also demanded that he sells me the tickets i wanted as I was not prepared to stand in another queue elsewhere. To his credit/001 he did sell me the tickets and was very cooperative after my bursts of anger. Once inside/001 we enjoyed the limited rides and entertainment. This place does not compare to the one in California.
alia_w1311|Jakarta- Indonesia|12 April 2017|Fun Fun Fun|5|F683BB4557A2F3779FF1EC10F7DDFFD9|Great place to have lots of Fun/001 with your family or your friends. Recommended to buy Universal Express so you won't have to waste time queueing for a ride. It is really worth it to beat the line especially when you come with small kids. Wear comfortable outfit/001 be aware for the weather forecast. For moslem ladies/001 bring your own Mukena/prayer outfit as they don't provide one in the prayer room.
Morteza S|None|12 April 2017|Very special |5|944C901CADAAD0433AE1C67D26C4850A|It take about one day and I recommend to buy express ticket from your hotel also visit palavan beech and take the cable car to visit the island from the top we were in equris hotel and it was so comfortable ....
Suruchi J|New Delhi- India|11 April 2017|Lot of Fun rides|4|16213D354FE3D339DE958CF3D010BE8E|I am a huge fan of extreme thrill rides . Hence The grey and red track roller coasters were the highest point of the trip for me. Few rides have special entries for solo riders which makes the access really fast . Even helps us to explore much more.Got to meet and greet the Madagascar and Shrey characters around 4 pm.Only thing missing was the time slots of the actors coming out for pictures.One will find pizza and fries for veg eating options .
951jjp|Singapore|11 April 2017|A Day of Fun|5|A51500ECFC5CE9CA4AB086EAF884A7E8|A great day out with the family. Tickets a little expensive. Annual membership may be more worth it if you like going there frequently.

Brenda M|Melbourne- Australia|11 April 2017|Enjoyable Day|5|2B3AD187A90C867D599E484B60B6B1DA|We arrived just after opening/001 the crowd was small and we got through the gates in a timely manner. Waiting times were up to about 40minutes on some of the rides in the morning but in the afternoon waiting was about 10-15minutes. We were able to ride on most of the rides and we rode on a few more than once.
Roshif2015|Sri Lanka|11 April 2017|Great day out|4|E57A2D6AE324F04D09D90DFD5AC1159A|Super outing for teenagers. We went on a weekday but there was still quite a crowd. However/001 everything works very efficiently. Would recommend getting the express pass. There is one for 30 dollars that lets you into the express queue once per ride and one for 50 dollars that lets you into the express queue unlimited times - for 20 dollars extra it is well worth it especially if you have kids who will want to go on one ride multiple times. The quality of food is adequate but not fantastic and quite expensive. Lockers are provided by each ride so you don't lose your valuables. On the whole a really nice experience. The taxi ride from city center costs around 20 dollars but there is also an MRT at Vivo city with a shuttle to universal.
Matiloe|Singapore- Singapore|11 April 2017|Nice but small|3|3BBA6C4F460D74C2070084933370F2B9|Very crowded at weekend time/001 but as the park is small you can spend half a day only. Attractions are great and every age can find something that fits expectations/001 castle for the little ones and bigger rollercoaster for the adults. Nice moment.
Muhannadh T|None|11 April 2017|Amazing!|5|5C534EDDDD56856CA1D487A1B09D4D60|Make sure you get there before 9am. Make sure you're the first in the queue. Gates open at 10am. Run to the Transformers ride. It's the best. After that complete all of the thrill rides around because after 11am the queues are about an hour long. Enjoy!
Kartika C|None|11 April 2017|Must visit in Singapore|4|D27D63320218D9B32A0D59BACFF41BE2|Definitely family attractions that must visit in Singapore !!!/001 I've been there for many times and never get bored/001 really loves Transformers rides and mummy eventough sometimes needs to cueing for quite long. Others attractions are set up well and food stall just nearby. However/001 the souvenirs are quite expensive to get
83Marie|Perth- Australia|11 April 2017|Buy a 6 month pass at the gate for $99 adult and $89 child (under 12)|4|802C8F2EC72C08BEC48151F81BA1C507|I looked online at cheaper prices and even on their website found it hard to navigate took the risk of buying ticket from the gate and was surprised to find it was only $99 for unlimited entry/001 you then proceed through the gates and get your photo taken for your card. We found this great as we wanted a two day pass/001 which they don't sell and was expecting to pay a bit more.I read a few reviews saying you don't need two days... Maybe if you don't have kids and avoid those rides/001 personally we want to go in everything and had a 3 adults and two kids 14 & 11 and got there first thing and left at closing/001 happy we bought the pass because we did not go on everything.Went yesterday Monday quiet in morning and late evening/001 mid day busy.We saw people with the fast pass $50 extra/001 I assume will see it all on one day/001 skipped all the queues.Also single riders got to skip some queues. Also lockers have free 45-1 hr/001 then $4 an hour we locker skipped to save some money. Must try the caramel popcorn $8 yummy and the $4 corn dogs best I've tasted/001 otherwise food prices/gift shop similar to Australia . Also if you get a 6month pass you get 10 percent off anything bought in Universal studios/001 or use your MasterCard (we are using nab travel card no fees great check it out) I think the lady said over $50 also a 10 percent off! YES I LIKE TO SAVE WHERE I CAN :)!!
TravelbyLight|Pretoria- South Africa|11 April 2017|Commercial |3|FC0C28154193E29F2F704E387D0768FA|Okay/001 but too commercial for my liking. Expected more "theme" - though the theme concept is evident/001 everything seems to be "ride oriented".
Yasmin K|Tanzania|10 April 2017|A must see in Singapore|5|64BA605DDA441416AAD8F0BDEBC015E6|A non stop entertainment for everyone. We spent the whole day and it was not enough. My favorite part was the live theater show/001 which was an excellent performance. Lots of rides/001 may shops for souvenirs/001 many options for food.
Mia R|None|10 April 2017|Not as massive as other theme parks|4|D92D26FE264EB83D930EFB3E40E08A7C|The Transformers 3D ride is undoubtedly the best ride here and we managed to go on it twice! As soon as the park opened/001 we rushed to this ride first/001 and the queue became long in no time. The Shrek 4D was a fun experience too/001 but the Canopy Flyer in Jurassic Park area was probably the most disappointing as it got over just as it started and the queue was long. Although the park was crowded/001 the average waiting time for the major rides was about 20 minutes - which is decent when compared to Disneyland in Paris (with at least 40 minutes wait time). This is not as big as Disneyland though and by lunch time/001 we were done with the entire park and by 3 PM/001 we moved out to explore other parts of Sentosa. We went on a weekday and weekends may be more packed.
SilverfishPhoto|United Kingdom|10 April 2017|Great Theme park|5|F320FB2B1EBCC463A2A8CB31E920B299|Great park /001 It's not Universal Orlando /001 and yes Orlando might have many more rides but I just love this park /001 Singaporean staff are amazing/001 clean /001 organised. compared to Universal Osaka japan/001 I would say heaven and earth /001/001 Osaka Universal waiting times 176 minutes to go on a ride /001 Universal Singapore between 20-40 min peek time for Express riders around 3-5 minutes at most /001 I have visit this park 4 days in a raw thats how cool it was . the Only park in the world that deserve 5 stars
K4rsty|Livingston- Scotland|10 April 2017|Obviously not as big as Florida but that's not necessarily a bad thing|5|F6FA883559B3E369797B737DBD227B9B|There was more than enough to keep our family of four occupied for the day. We went early morning midweek and it's wasn't too busy. Roller coasters were good for afults and older children and plenty to keep the younger ones amused.Slightly confusing to get too as we had taken the cable car over to Sentosa. If you're using this option/001 you then need to get another cable car and the monorail to the park but not difficult to do and good fun.
Juzer R|None|9 April 2017|Awesome |5|DF1B27F57B957376B092012D39399053|Best ride Transformer 4DRoller coaster Best Many more rides better take fast pass/001 so you can fully enjoy all the rides.
Kyle M|Colorado Springs- Colorado|9 April 2017|I might be spoiled|3|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|I visited Universal Studios Singapore on a Monday/001 hoping there would not be much of a crowd. Instead/001 I discovered that everywhere in the park was very busy. I was only able to ride 3 rides in a 7 hour period/001 because I had to wait an average of an hour plus for the rides I did ride. I feel spoiled/001 because I am used to Universal Studios Orlando/001 which is a bigger park. The Singapore version felt like it was half the size and therefore/001 a little bit disappointing.
sachin k|Mumbai (Bombay)- India|9 April 2017|Full of fun and adventure|5|7F282621B7E48D293874D25A8FCE4D0B|Best thing to do when you visit to Singapore. Enjoyed the goose bumps slides like HUMAN/001 CYLON and MUMMY rides. Best among all was the TRANSFORMER ride/001 it was one of kind experience. Also light camera & action ride is good to get interim of cinematography. Sad part was long ques and waiting time for each ride suggest to go for express pass to enjoy all the rides in time. keep watch on show timings do not miss the water show it was thrilling to watch entire action in front of your eyes. lot of dining options yet very limited choices for vegetarian.
tarungeorgej|Meerut- India|9 April 2017|good look but scary rides|3|69D034A9CBF8241E7F1B1F8EA9566982|when we entered the studios we first went to Madagascar. It was exciting we have to board a boat and you will go inside a broken part of a ship inside there will be the robotic characters and then you will be out of the ship. then we went to a roller coaster when it climbs the track it will be slow but when it will go down it will be superfast it was a short ride. this studio is mostly made for kids and teenagers but be careful that some rides are a little scary.
Patricia L|None|9 April 2017|You don't need an express pass!|5|1A933DA0425695963CD7F8A63AF78639|I seriously think that you don't need an express pass if you don't mind waiting for 45 min~ I love the concept where the whole themepark are filled with fans/001 water station/001 keep you hydrated and chill although the weather is really hot! Must try: human vs cylon/001 transformer/001 lights camera actions.. The fireworks on every Saturday not really impressive but worth staying till late night if you don't mind~
cashish11|Bengaluru- India|9 April 2017|Must do in Singapore|5|21340E15DB6C78393D725A13B9D965D4|I had discounted Universal Studios in my first 3 visits to Singapore/001 assuming it's just movie sets. However/001 this time I did decide to go and was amazed by the quality of rides. Specifically/001 Transformers and Mummy experience is something you just can't miss!
Namihos|Singapore- Singapore|8 April 2017|Full of fun and adventure|5|052CA4F039EB2A4BF397B1B085BD360C|Have visited here twice. And I must say each time I was so impressed.Some tricks you may wanna consider before going:Go on weekdays. Weekends are hell crowded and the queue time is about 120 min for each ride especially in the morning. You can simply buy the express pass/001 still facing lines but shorter.Be there at 10 AM to get the most out of it.Plan your day ahead/001 prioritize the rides you want to do the most as you will have short of time. My suggestions are Transformers/001 roller coaster (Cylon and Human)/001 Revenge of the Mummy/001 Jurassic Park Rapids adventure. You can simply forget about Madagascar and Shrek 4D if you do not have enough time. But if you looking for something a bit relaxing/001 go for them.There are several shows during the day/001 not all are good but worth watching if you have time.The queues will be shorter in the evening. We got the chance to ride Cylon 3 times and Revenge of the Mummy 2. Food is of ver low quality and pricey! (I am not sure if eating will be a good idea at all before riding the high-speed rides!) Anyhow/001 that is the only thing you get to eat there. You can take some chocolate or granola bars or try some ice cream there (Ben & Jerry`s at Far Far Away) and then later eat dinner in Sentosa. (Chillis restaurant and some local food nearby). All the rides will be closed at 7 PM.Enjoy and have lots of fun.
Tish Z|Rochester- New York- United States|8 April 2017|Mostly for kids|3|DCB8CB332E816F956B6D7A8FE0DC3D41|We went with a group of friends 20-30s and had a good time with them but the park is definitely more for children. There are a couple extreme rides like Human/001 but with relatively long waits (40 min and it was a slowish hot day). Transformers was my favorite with 3D glasses and special effects but makes many people feel sick.

Tez K|None|8 April 2017|Brilliant!|5|BCF4A5A64009F27AEC4084F223987B13|We are a young family of 6 and have visited a number of parks across Asia and this was by far our best experience. The park is smaller than Universal Osaka and whilst Disney HK is magical this park is very well organized. Our longest queue was 40 mins which is unheard of at this type of park. We had a brilliant day!
Gas-O89|None|8 April 2017|A fun small park with poor maintanence|3|2534F18499E59D970A5131027E5D5B11|My partner and I have visited many other Universal Studios parks around the world and wanted to give this one a go while on our honeymoon. The park itself is surprisingly small and most of the themed lands merge in to one another. The ride selection was okay for a thrill seeker/001 but might be less so for young families. Most of the rides during our visit were open with the odd ride down for renovations which is completely understandable. One thing that was really noticeable though/001 especially when comparing the park to its US equivalents was that the park was poorly maintained. Most of the rides paint jobs were flaky and the theming and props looked like they had been through a hurricane. I really wasn't expecting this from such a new park and for me/001 it really showed the low level of commitment to maintain elements when comparing it to a Disney theme park.Would I come here again? Probably not. But if you're not really fussed about how a park is kept/001 and want a small handful of thrilling rides/001 go for it.
sjones2370|Chiltern- Australia|8 April 2017|Very "touristy"|4|7022255937B8FE84717B675FF63AE950|Definitely catering to the tourist crowd. Was very impressed that all the que's for rides had ceiling fans to combat the heat. The lines were not that long/001 either (max wait time 40min) Blown away by Anient Egypt...my favourite part of the whole park. Very clean/001 lots of seats and shady places to sit.
ManojDivya|Bangalore|8 April 2017|Loved it! Had lots of fun with family |5|0A452D92E10B01787A9E3AF2542AE45B|A great place to spend one full day and evening! Have a lot of amusement activities for all ages. The tickets allows unlimited entry for all the rides and shows. Spend some time researching the rides and shows that one likes before reaching/001 as some may have long queues. We went there on a weekday and found that the queues were empty in the evening to leisurely enjoy the place. Must visit in Singapore.
tobyr631|Singapore|8 April 2017|Friday Family Day|4|BD6A32149CCCAD63CC4C843F6C57302C|Fun day out for all the family. Tips - don't go on weekend or public holiday/001 get there early & purchase priority / express pass.
Shah512|Hyderabad- India|7 April 2017|Must visit|5|DABE28712805213506597EDEAF013171|Hell lot to walk.Gear up comfortably. Carry abundant snacks with you. A must pack is the selfie stick.It can rain any moment in Singapore/001 do not forget to carry an umbrella or raincoat. In case of rain/001 all the attractions are temporarily withdrawn for the safety of the visitors. So please do have the time margin in mind. Do not pack your schedule.Arrive by 10.00 am to experience the most of it. Universal is best to be visited on a weekday to avoid the rush. Even on a weekday/001 buy an express pass. Depending on your group/001 you can plan your visit. More time spent on kids activities if with kids. Must visits: Battlestar Galactica Human & Cylon Accelerator Transformers Jurassic park rapids adventure (wet ride) Live water show (water world)Madagascar/001 Shrek & Puss in the boots are very well planned. Even for an adult it is a relaxing experience.Live shows keep happening at various times. Plan as you please.After each ride/001 you exit at a store. Do not forget to pick goodies.The major rides need you to place your stuff in lockers. In case you are more of an adventure person/001 can select multiple entry pass.
Nadine S|None|7 April 2017|A day of fun and excitement.|5|16665CB32B7D74BACCAABA2CCC445733|Roller coasters/001 shows and souvenirs. It is worth getting the express wrist band if you don't like waiting in long queues (there are still queues/001 just much shorter)

Memories in USS will be cherished in our hearts.
Coight69|Victoria- Australia|7 April 2017|Loved it  my whole family loved it!|5|B1D1188DC84917697D474361731657EA|This is a great park with plenty to do. My 18 month old was kept busy all day. The 2 roller coasters are incredible and I couldn't get enough of them. Good mix of thrill rides and family rides and the theming is great. Much better than any of the pathetic theme parks we have here in Australia.
Dan2929|Singapore- Singapore|7 April 2017|Nice place|5|4FB3AEA4C12B12736D3D76618032253F|It's my 1st time here. This is magnificent! Everything is so well placed and we enjoyed so much! Unfortunately/001 due to the rain/001 we did not continue or complete the tour here. Hope will have chance to visit again.
A TripAdvisor Member|None|7 April 2017|Sentosa universal Singapore |3|None|This was a nicely done park for its themes. Maybe I'm getting a bit older and have seen it and done it before. The roller coasters looked pretty insane but didn't go on because I felt a bit unwell. Food was the usual theme park food: terrible fast food and soft drinks or water. Shops were so highly priced I didn't bother to buy anything-usual theme park though. I didn't feel it was anything that amazing/001 just another theme park! I've heard queues are bad on the weekend/001 I went during the week and they weren't bad. Like 10mins waiting for transformers ride.
ankeet_sinha|Nairobi- Kenya|7 April 2017|Underwhelming but express pass is a must|4|E4DF5E77910752ED812205020AC79581|I have been to Disneyland Paris and now Universal Studios Singapore and must say it pales in comparison to Disneyland Paris. Not much to do if you are with young kids but it is not a bad place by any means.Couple of things - Get lots of water as I had heard you get water but not once did I find a spot. We bought a long sipper due to which we could get an liquid refilled at no charge as long as we had that sipper. Also/001 get a hat and raincoat since the weather is fickle. Also please get an express pass as it will save loads of time and enable you to do most rides. Since we had planned to go to the SEA aquarium/001 we left at 3 pm from there otherwise we would have done all rides. You also have the option of re entry on the same day as they stamp you before you leave. You also get baby prams on rent for SGD 15 which is a bit steep but it serves the purpose.The gift shop at the start is also quite decent/001 not as many options as Disney but you can get lot of stuff nevertheless. You can buy and they give you the option of picking it from a drop off point so use that option to avoid carrying luggage.Now for the park - it is shaped like a big circle. You can start from the left which is Madagascar and take the water ride as well as get yourself clicked with the cast of Madagascar and do the merry go round if you have a child (this is something which was easier to do as compared with Disney). Then you go to Far Far Away or the land of Shrek where you can do the Shrek 4D ride and the Puss in Boots Adventure Ride. While the Shrek 4D takes almsot an hour/001 it is not as impressive so avoid if you are short on time. Do the Puss in Boots ride though as it is different and quite good.Then move to Jurassic park for the roundabouts/001 the water adventure and the roller coaster - all of which are good. After that you go to the land of Pharaohs/001 Egypt which has a roller coaster and an adventure ride.The to the transformer section where you can do the really scary roller coaster and the Transformers 7D ride which is basically the best ride in the park. This is a must. Avoid getting clicked by the photographers who charge a bomb for their photos but if you must then there is a parade at 3 pm which is in the Sesame street section which is after the transformers section and there you can get yourself clicked and later on printed as well. The Sesame Street portion has diners and is covered with a skylight so you can relax there.A suggestion here is that get the map via google/001 explore all rides on youtube and then see which ones you want to do and do them first when you get there This will save time alongwith the Express pass which reduces waiting time by 30 mins. Beware though that some rides are not covered under express pass so waiting is a must for them.Have fun but if you have been to Disneyland Paris then dont expect it to be at the same level.
D B|Brisbane- Australia|7 April 2017|A fun family day|4|5A7AAD07FD36A57F9323964803E5D0F3|Our family (kids 3/001 9/001 11) spent most of the day at universal. We made sure we were there pretty much as it opened. The crowds built up as the day went on but ok early December it wasn't too busy. It was hot but not uncomfortably so. There were some line ups. The longest was probably 20 minutes so ok. Food/001 as you expect/001 wasn't cheap but ok.The kids all had a great day. By about 4pm we had done enough though.We took‚Äã a stroller for the three year old and were very thankful that we did. Lots of walking for little legs.We had a few shots of rain so were glad of our rain ponchos.We had to do a bit of splitting up to keep all ages happy.Older kids loved the Shrek roller coaster best.
Sunita A|Secunderabad- India|6 April 2017|Most enjoyable!|5|2AFF056A2B121F680DC7E1EDA9285F32|It's a slice of America in the East! Expect long lines at the entrance/001 but beyond that/001 each zone had wait time warnings that gave a heads up if it would take a long time to get in. Plenty of food and entertainment/001 paradise for kids. Appropriate signages for topsy-turvy rides if you feel you want to keep your lunch down! The Egyptian mummy ride is awesome!
Pr4sh4nt|Lucknow- India|6 April 2017|A day well spent!|5|2BA59611CDE22ACCF637223A8EB57B96|I would recommend people to buy express tickets or take the Single entry wherever possible! The place has so much to offer you can just spend the whole day and still not be done with all the rides.

alfredc466|Kota Kinabalu- Malaysia|6 April 2017|A great Theme park befits for a memorable visit at Universal.|5|A59E5F2BA06ADDF0E63F2E58892A4C8D|Indeed a great and wonderful place to visit for great fun and memorable moments.Lots of interesting things to do and see. The activities there can last the whole day without you knowing/001 till you feel the tired legs after venturing through the many theme park areas. Only set back/001 expect big crowds and mass human jams when going for the rides especially on weekends...
mimipie2015|Sydney- Australia|6 April 2017|GOOD family fun!|4|E9735DDE69BD031E73D6236F96C1C6FB|Our young family enjoyed the studios a lot. It's such an easy trip from the city ($12 cab) Here are a few tips. Midweek crowds are much more manageable. Try to avoid the weekend crush. The express pass is a MUST with young kids. Even on a moderately busy day/001 the queues were from 30mins to 1.5hrs for the Transformers ride (which was excellent). The pass is not cheap/001 but it allows you to bypass the queues almost entirely. In the hot weather/001 this makes a huge difference to the day's enjoyment. We managed to go on all the rides we wanted (12 of them) and left with smiles. The pass is cheaper off-peak (early in morning/001 or after lunch) and can be bought in many places around the park. Bring spare clothes for little ones (some rides are wet/001 and there is a small water fountain play area). You can fill up water bottles around the place. The locker system is an annoyance for some of the larger roller coasters. You have to check your bags before you ride. On busy days there is a locker queue. It's free for 2.5 hours so it might be an idea to check your bags and do the two largest rollercoasters first (Sci Fi world and Mummy World).
QueenBiancaofDiamond|Adelaide- Australia|6 April 2017|Universal was a good day out|4|D8C7167F46274F87226F75295E7DACC8|The highlight for me and my family was the Sesame Street Breakfast. This was definitely 5*!To enter Universal before it officially opens was an amazing feeling. We then went to breakfast where Cookie Monster led my youngest child to the buffet. The breakfast experience was amazing. The sesame street characters took their time with all groups and their staff assisted in taking photos for us. An amazing experience.After breakfast/001 Universal officially opened so we started to explore. My children's favourite ride was the Elmo one. Universal was fine but I expected more. I've been to Disneyland a few times and felt that Disneyland was run much better than this Universal. They could do so much more. It was a good day out but I wouldn't rush back to Universal Singapore
jerrybhatia|None|5 April 2017|Exceptionally good|5|ED19CB39336503A2A2ABA1349088F5E1|Try reaching there by 9 am and take transformer ride as the first ride..that is the best ride and has a lot of waiting period....keep map in hand and one can figure out the other sections as well.....a lot of activities are present and it's difficult to elaborate all here... Must visit if you are in Singapore..
tjjohn|Meerut|5 April 2017|Interesting disorganized and an over crowded adventure park|3|EA8271F8B12372C87BFE650BE4AD3B56|The park has interesting themes and exciting rides but the surging crowds was a put off. We spent about five hours here and could do just three events that lasted a total time of about 30 Mins.The rest was spent on standing in a queue awaiting our turn and searching for items of interest and eating in a restaurant. The Jurassic park theme was pretty good but the ride lasted just 6 minutes after a wait period of about 50 plus minutes. Madagascar also was good but fortunately the wait period was shorter. The question of whether the visit is worth the price is difficult to answer. All the themes are good. There are some that interests kids and some for teens and others for adults. Re- organizing the park with detailed information on the various themes and some brief summary of what can be seen or experienced plus a map of the park with directions and sign boards etc. and instructions would go a long way to help visitors to manage their time in the best possible manner inside the park/001 If these are already available they are obviously not available to every one. I was searching for the official website of Universal Studios for such information but could not find one. I could get only information provided by third party tour operators for this attraction.Paying extra for an express ticket to jump the queue was an option I was not very keen on. One jumps the queue encroaching the time from the standard ticket holder's time there by raising his/her time in the queue.An absorbing subject for a debate in ethics.
moonflower59|Gosford- Australia|5 April 2017|Exceeded Expectations|5|2F8B3B9C614B255583F1103983C5D16F|Arrive at opening and get your tickets online to get best value. We went mid week and had no queues until lunch time. The afternoon was ok but top experiences had 30-60 minutes lines. Even the oldies loved the Mummy and Battlestar Galactica....not too scary! Lots of food outlets around but don't expect too many bargains.
Faiyaz C|None|5 April 2017|A fun experience!|5|0172C696A958ACBCDFA7AC57C64C1972|Awesome time there. Takes you back in your younger days. Make sure you go early and spend enough time there. You do not want to miss the shows. The line gets quite long towards the end of the day.
