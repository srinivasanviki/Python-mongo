It's not as expensive if you go fine dining or eating in a steak house. The price is reasonable, I'm telling you and you will be satisfied with the serving. Sometimes, on different occasions or on other branch, it takes time for our orders to arrive. We always go to the one at Centerpoint, along orchard. They have buffet there (but not including the main dish). So after you order your main dish, YOU CAN ALREADY START EATING! No need to keep your hunger and wait for your order. Will definitely eat there again when I visit Singapore.

Food is good, service too except for everytime I ask for a blanket, even if I just board the plane, they always say that they will get back to me. Then, I arrived at my destination and guess what, they never get back to me. Either that or they will tell me that there are no blankets available. Knowing that everybody JUST boarded the plane. It's not a big deal for me, its just that i encounter this same response, or no response at all everytime. Anyways, I will still fly by PAL whenever I can. :) Still a great plane and good people.

It is like stepping into a preheated oven, the humidity is very high. If you take the long walk, you will also do a ten-minute uphill climb, which may not be suitable for all? In saying that, I am fat and middle aged, and apart from the fact I lost bucket loads of sweat, I managed the climb just fine. Be smart, wear a towel around your neck to wipe sweat and absorb it. Now, onto the dragons! What an awesome thing to see! Definitely prehistoric, lazing about in the sun, yet fast when they did move. We saw a gathering of them in the 'waterhole' as many people would I imagine. Saw a few young ones up trees and running about. Huge spiders also, deer ( sadly they were on the beach dying from komodo bites), buffalo and awesome native snails. All in all, a wonderful trip. Oh, and when you come through the markets, make sure you barter or you will pay three times the actual price they are willing to take, and ignore the begging children, this is a job for them not a necessity!

Best advice I can give is to get an unlimited front of line pass. Although this may cost a bit more, it is well worth it, as you will not be in lines for hours ( yes in busy times it can be that long) and there are many rides you will want to take over and over again. I found the 3D Transformers ride to be the best I have ever experienced. The Jurassic Park ride was great to cool down ( you will get very wet lol) and the Mummy was yet another scary one.There are plenty of places to sit and rest, plenty of eateries of differing types, huge amounts of merchandise at good prices ( not too expensive) and lots of etertainment around the place. All in all, a fantastic day.

For the price paid, and the reputation to uphold, I found my room sorely lacking in quality and decor. Being used to staying in 4-5 star accommodations, this seemed to not quite come up to scratch. The view I had out my window was also disappointing, that of a concrete roof area. Being an Accor member, I thought this could have been avoided also. The room was smaller than expected, quite noisy from the outside traffic, dark, and nothing special. I think I may have been given a 'whatever's left' room as the Adele concert was on that weekend, but I had been booked for months, so felt this was a little unfair. The one saving grace? Richard Branson stayed the same night, and I passed him in the halls.

With the bus just across the road to anywhere you could want to go, and an underground metro station being built right there at the moment ( to be opened soon) and taxi's being ridiculously cheap, we were positioned perfectly for easy and cheap transport to explore Singapore. Even to travel to Sentosa Island for Universal Studios, the S.E.A Aquarium etc, which is quite a distance, was only a S$14 cab fare! The hotel itself was lovely. I arrived off a cruise at 10am, and a room was given to me upon arrival no extra charge ( normally any accommodation doesn't allow til after 2pm) and I was also asked how late a checkout I would like, as I am an Accor member, and was able to choose 3pm as my checkout time! The porters took care of all our baggage, we never lifted a finger. The room was lovely, modern, clean and well catered. The only thing I could say which was slightly strange to us, was that although there were many lights, none were directly in the ceiling, centre of the main room, so it could seem a little dark in there. The beds were very comfortable, the views great, no noise from other rooms even though we knew they had many patrons around us. Everything was controlled or locked by our room card. The lifts were great. We ate on the premises at both the breakfast buffet and the cafe, and also had room service. All were fantastic. The cafe seemed a little expensive. Breakfast offered an extensive array of choices. We also ate by the pool on level 4, and that food was excellent. As was the pool itself, although I found the chlorine levels were too high, not allowing one to open their eyes underwater. There is a huge mall across the road for your every need. All in all, the staff were wonderful, food great, room clean and comfortable. We used the free shuttle service to the airport upon leaving. I would stay here again.

I was expecting a very nice hotel for this price, especially seeing as I stay at the Pullman 5 star for this price on a regular basis. I was thoroughly underwhelmed. The tv was so small it was ridiculous in this day and age.There was no comfortable chair to sit on the room. The room itself was extremely small, and 'all in one', not a bedroom separated off. (which for this high price one would expect). There was No air conditioning, just a ceiling fan! On top of it already being overpriced, I had to pay $13 for the night's parking. As you can see by my status here, I have stayed at many hotels all over the world and use this knowledge to make my observations and ratings, and I would rate this hotel a 2 star hotel. I am never cruel or unfair, I would never say anything untrue, and this is of course just my opinion. Positives> The staff were pleasant, and the paid secure parking was good. The bathroom was clean, the bed reasonably comfortable.

But, in saying that, the service from the front desk was top notch, the staff member polite and extremely helpful. The room was very clean, and I had the facilities I expected for the small price I paid, including free toiletries and tea/coffee. It was extremely central, two seconds walk and you are right in the centre of the city. There were really no negatives, just that the room is exceedingly small, but that is not an issue if you are only staying overnight, or for short periods of time. It had a flatscreen tv, with freeview. I would stay again if I grabbed it for the right price.

I will start with the good things, the pro's, about my stay here. As a few people have said, it is within walking distance to most things you may want to do/see in Auckland, or there are buses close by. There is a huge car park opposite the apartments, in which I assume one could park their car? Also, there were quite a few places to buy food or sit and eat within a close walking distance. I was catching a train to the Strand station early the next morning, and this was easily done for $8 with a taxi I ordered by phone the night before.The apartment itself had a dishwasher, washing machine/drier, microwave, and fridge, all in good working order. I was also given 5gigs of wifi, very good. And now to the con's: The moment I opened the door into my apartment, all I could smell was a strong smell of urine. The bathroom is directly to your right as you open the door, and it had one wall with paint all peeling off and mould at the top. The bed was comfortable for one, but I would think not for two as it was either a double or very small queen, and soft, so I feel you would roll together perhaps? The apartment itself was a lot smaller and darker than I was to believe by the photos I had seen online. The couch was originally a good leather couch, but now was all worn in the seat, allowing for snagging of pantyhose or sharp edges on bare legs. The tv was a laugh! It was an old tv, not flatscreen ( I couldn't believe anyone even has one of those any more!!) and a small one at that! Saving grace here was that most SKY channels were available, if you could be bothered squinting at the wee screen. The apartment was basically clean, with a few issues of cleanliness in the bathroom (someone else's poop stripe was still in the toilet).They made a big deal about making sure you lock your door, which didn't instill me with much confidence of my safety! The office was just one of the apartments, not in the main entrance area, but upstairs on floor 2 and hard to find! In summary, I had a decent enough stay, but left thinking I probably wouldn't stay there again. If they were to just 'perk' things up a bit, I am sure it may give a better impression.

The trip to the top, although reasonably costly, is worth it if you can afford it. There is much to do, great photo ops, and views to die for! You can bungy from the platform, walk the see through skywalk, or just take in the views through the windows. The casino is also huge, but take a good stash of cash!

I stayed here for a few nights, and it was comfortable and warm, and surprisingly quiet. It is in a good location for walking to the hospital and has a local mall also within walking distance. I did find the shower to be unclean, and a few damaged areas in the walls etc. Good towels were supplied, and the kitchen was well stocked with more than one could need, which was great as I cooked all my meals rather than eat out. Local takeaway restaurants/pizza places, are happy to deliver there, and the taxi company they recommended comes quickly. You have to pay for wifi, but it is not expensive. There is a coin operated laundry which is very handy. All in all, a good basic place to stay, in a convenient location.

Although the trip took 5 hours it was comfortable, with plenty of legroom, there was a table ( or tray table in front of you like on an airline), I had power points so plugged in my tablet. There was a good selection of food and drink in the dining cart, some a little higher priced than others, but all about what you would expect in a cafe. The scenery was great. I will definitely travel to Auckland this way again next time. There are two negatives though for me, and anyone travelling from Taumarunui...you have to go to National Park station, even though we have a perfectly good station here, as they will not stop for us. Secondly, the station yu end up in, Strand, is very isolated, and you get there after dark. There are cabs waiting right there, so if no one is picking you up, it's probably the safest thing to do.

I was very pleasantly surprised! Modern furnishings, two televisions ( one in bedroom), fully equipped kitchen with full size fridge/freezer, microwave and dishwasher! Full size, free to use, washing machine and drier in the bathroom. Sky with many channels. The bed was firm but comfortable, clean rooms, large balcony. If you need parking, make sure you get there as early as possible to ake them aware of your need and have it reserved or assigned to you, as there are not a lot of spaces. It is not free, it is $25 per night. The parking is however brilliant, as it is in a very safe spot under the building. The staff were wonderful, helpful and courteous.The only negative about this place, is the road you have to go down to get to it! I was walking to the hospital ( thank God only one time) from here, and the hill almost killed me lol. Free internet. All in all, recommended accommodations.

I had acquired my accommodation very cheaply through online booking at about $80 night.I stayed in apartment G15, which, even though it was ground level, was extremely quiet. I liked the positioning of it, and it seemed more private being where it was at the end of the hallway, as people only came there if staying at that end, not just walking through to go to rooms. The staff were amazing, from storing my bags early morning til I could check in, to advising me on places to eat, local entertainment, transport etc. I was staying here to support a friend in hospital, and the 10-15 min walk was easy from here, across the Grafton Bridge. There are a number of buses that can also be caught to go to the hospital if that is why you are in Auckland. I ordered pizza one night, but apart from that, I found the facilites for cooking, and the provided utensil/pots/plates etc were more than adequate. All round, I would recommend this place definitely. There was only one negative, and that wasn't the fault of the property, but because of the location, it can be a bit 'hairy' at night out in the street. There was one fellow who kept asking me for money. In saying that, the reception staff, when I told them this, called the police to have him removed. Oh, and 1gig free internet every day was awesome! You get your own modem!!

At first I thought it would be hard being right in the centre of the township, but the location is brilliant, right next to cafes and meals , a supermarket and two seconds from the Ferry. The staff were polite and obliging. Overall, I would recommend this accommodation to all. Not many places have a purpose built unit with dog area! Value for money.

Not so, this stay sadly. :( Normally, the woman running the place which has recently changed it's name from Hectors, Annabelle, was hugely accommodating and went out of her way to please each and every customer. She would heat the room before you arrived if it was cold outside, add special finishing touches to your stay, and even once drove to Queenstown airport to pick me up as I had no transport! Hence, we stayed here every time we flew out of Queenstown, to make our driving time easier. Sadly, this stay was not as good by far. The room now has very ordinary furnishings, against the modern decor it once had. The tv was hardly watchable. The staffmember at the office was nice to give us a discount, as we knew the past manager, but the rooms were more expensive than they had ever been anyway. ( normally we paid $120 tops for a room there, and she gave us a $20 discount to make this a $130 room). I was surprised by changes that were obviously made to save the new owners money...ie...the lights were now no longer on along the decking at night, which made it very hard to find your way to the car or office safely, there was no longer free wifi ( and the staff member told me that was because it cost the owners over $400 per month to supply, which is not my concern) which is an important part of my stay anywhere for work purposes so I had to pay, and even though it was only $5, it seemed bad that nowadays, when wifi is pretty much imperative to most customers, they had made it chargeable after having been free in the past. Even the tea, coffee and toiletries were cheaper versions.The room was clean, the bed comfortable, so there are no complaints there. It is just sad for us, as our favourite place to stay which felt like a 4+ star by the way we were treated, has now turned into more of a 2 star in our eyes, and nowhere near as welcoming.

Not having a car, I needed to be able to walk to any amenities necessary, and this was definitely a great location for shops, pubs, restaurants etc, all within easy walking distance. We needed two beds, so had a two room unit up by reception, which comprised of a lounge area with tv with a lounge suite and single bed, a bedroom area with double bed, a dining table and four chairs, a full kitchen area with fridge, tea and coffee facilities supplied, all the crockery, utensils, cutlery and pots etc you could possibly think of, shower, vanity and loo...everything one might need for a four day stay. Now, the decor is a little old fashioned, and certainly not fancy 5 star, but this is well made up for by the fact it is clean, comfortable, and the staff are wonderful. Two lovely ladies have only just taken the place over, and I can see good things ahead for them, as they were efficient, cleaning my room every day leaving fresh fluffy white towels and clean bedlinen, and were so pleasant and helpful. To me, an avid world traveller, having stayed from backpackers to 5 star hotels, the most important things when you stay somewhere are not necessarily fancy duvet's and hotel brand names, more often than not I just need comfort, cleanliness, and courtesy...Kelly's has them all.

As it was, I was excited to be going to Auckland to see my favourite oldie, Rod Stewart. I bought a discounted 'Groupon' stay at the apartments really cheaply online, I think it was around $139 for the night. ( Nowadays, that's cheap, especially for this quality of place) Imagine my surprise when I got there, and the place was far beyond my expectations! The decor was extremely modern, all red, black and chrome. A very good sized lounge with kitchen at the other end and dining to one side dominated the apartment, with a large bedroom and ensuite off that. I was most impressed as to the cleanliness of the place, the condition and attention to detail taken, as there were little extras about to make the stay better. Your own washing machine and drier, tea and coffee facilities, nice toiletries, kitchen equipped with pretty much everything you would need. But then.....the big bonus! We knew the apartment was close to the Vector Arena, that's why we were so happy to book it. We had no idea!! Off the lounge was a balcony which we looked from to try to spot the Arena...If you look at my pictures attached here, you will see that the Arena was literally perhaps 80 metres away, down a safe well-lit paved walkway, directly between the Waldorf and the Vector Arena! We strolled along there, grabbing a few things from the shops on this paved walk, when we were ready to go to the show ( which was incredible by the way!) and casually walked back at night without any fear or worry about walking the streets of a city at night. The reception staff had been courteous and well informed, and told us of the late night entry areas and any other questions we needed answered. The main areas were clean and well maintained. The bed we eventually crawled into was warm and clean, and exceedingly comfortable. All in all, a fantastic stay, and we will definitely stay again if we go to Auckland for another concert. A++++ and highly recommended.

Normally, you will find some of these boxes are ticked. We have found with every stay, every one of those boxes are ticked....and more. The owners in this motel go out of their way to make your stay comfortable, happy and more than fulfil your every need. Price is a big thing to us, as we travel a lot, and this motel, even at full price, is worth every penny. If you are internet savvy, keep your eyes on Groupon or TreatMe, and you will find excellent discount coupons for the Cedar Court come up, making the stay ridiculously cheap! We have stayed in far more expensive motels, and not left as happy, as we exchange waves goodbye with the owners Jo and Ken. We always know we will return to their motel when next in Napier...no question of it.

Considering it's position, it was extremely quiet. We ate in their restaurant, and the food was well cooked, well presented, and comparibly priced.

The staff were amazing, helpful, polite, and happy to go out of their way for us. The room was clean, modern, warm, and spacious. The bed was also warm, well dressed and so comfortable. The bathroom well appointed with plenty of towels, free toiletries, and clean. We decided to eat there at their own restaurant, but when we went down to it, it was closed. I asked the reception staff when it might open, and they said they were happy to open it just for us! They did, and we ate a lovely meal there, brought to us very quickly, we were most impressed. We caught the free shuttle service they provide, both to and from the airport. Both times they were punctual, the female driver was very friendly yet professional, drove safely in the busy Auckland streets, and handled all our bags for us. All in all, this hotel gets a big thumbs up!

I unfortunately booked two nights here, one at the beginning of my journey and one at the end, as it is close to the airport. That is its only saving grace, the fact it is convenient distance wise. Mind you, in saying that, there have been roadworks in between it and the airport for a long time now, which does slow the trip somewhat. So, I arrive, to a rather disinterested staff member, go to my room, settle my things, and decide to go to the bathroom. Hmmm, to my surprise, just ONE towel ! Yes, no bathmat, no face washer, no hand towel, and indeed not two 'sets' of towels as there should be in a double room. The bathroom is also filthy with permanent 'slime and grime' in all the corners, and something indescribable behind the loo. ( no, I will not describe it !) I was tired so went to my bed and decided to watch some tv, only to find there was no remote! So, I go to reception, and tell them of my need for at least a facewasher, and that there is no remote. The girl, hardly interested, says someone must have stolen it, and that she should be able to find one to bring to me at some point, but can't I just use the tv without it?! I can, and I did, til she came with one facewasher and a remote. No apologies, no hint of realising the unprofessional running of this motel. So, it was bad. I left a loaf of bread on the bench overnight ( sealed) and awoke to masses of ants covering the area....but that may just be Auckland rather than their motel? So, thank God, I left there then and travelled to Napier where I stayed in an awesome place called "The Cedar Court Motel", where they were so helpful with everything, and the motel was well equipped and clean. Must be time for me to leave them another report, as they are awesome. But, sadly, I wasn't going to waste my money, and had prebooked a second night at this horrible hotel of horrors, the SilverOaks, so stayed again on my last night in Auckland. Much to my surprise, I didn't have the one towel issue this time...oh no....there were NONE!!! Not a single towel, facewasher etc! It was almost amusing, as I couldn't imagine how they thought this could possibly be acceptable! Once again it was filthy, noisy, smelly, and just downright awful. I am not picky, you can have tired old furniture, a decor from the 80's, I understand road noise, whatever, if the place is clean, the bed reasonably comfortable, clean towels and soap, and something for me to make a cup of tea with, I am happy. This place just delivered nothing positive. Such a shame. If I had more than two thumbs, they would all be pointing down.

The man at the office was efficient and polite in organising my room and checking me in, then as he told me where my room was, realised it was up a set of stairs, so carried my suitcase to the room for me! Once in, I couldn't believe what I got for my money. See the pictures attached, but I walked into a huge room, with lounge area, with full sized couch, dining area with very modern full sized dining table and chairs, gorgeously comfortable queensize bed ( oh the blanket kept making me want to stroke it, it was so soft!) separate kitchen area with everything in it you could possibly need to self cater ( fully stocked), then down a long hallway was a clean and modern bathroom. There was freeview tv on a huge 42 inch flatscreen, larger than you normally get in accommodations. I enjoyed free wifi, as much as I wanted. There were complimentary toiletries, and tea and coffee. I ordered my dinner into the room which was excellent, see separate review for that. The next morning, exactly on time, I was taken to the airport with the free shuttle, also included in my price. All in all, I was comfortable, it was clean, modern and inviting, and the staff man was polite and helpful. What more can you ask for?

Was only as I am looking for airport accommodation, that I saw the name and thought I had better do this review! Where do I start? I arranged an airport pickup, and enquired whether they had a restaurant or food nearby etc, on the phone with them during the days before my arrival. No one turned up to pick me up when I landed. I rang them from the airport, and the woman said they would be there very soon. I waited all up and hour and a half from my arrival time. Now I flew in at 7pm. I was tired and hungry, hence the reason I had made my enquiries regarding food. I was taken to the hotel in an old beatup van, by a woman and what I can only assume was her teenage son, sitting n the front seat, and me ushered to get myself and my baggage in the back..no help. The young boy then turned the radio up loud on our trip to the hotel, and then proceeded to argue with his mother in a different language loudly, but it seems the F word is universal, as I could make that out loud and clear! We finally arrived at the hotel at around 8:45, and she parked then left the van, still arguing with her son. I got myself out and my suitcases! I dragged them up the stairs to the unattended reception desk, and rang a bell whilst I caught my breath. A man finally turned up, asked my name, then gave me a key. I asked him where the room was, as he gave me no indication. Then I asked him about food, as I could see the restaurant to my right, but he said I was too late to eat there, the kitchen was closed!!! I told him that was their fault and as I could hear dishes being clattered about in the kitchen, I said that there was still someone there so could I have anything, even just a sandwich? He said no, flat out and left! I walked into the kitchens myself and this was the only good thing about this whole place.the girl there who was obviously the underpaid cook, once I told her my terrible experiences so far, said not to worry and she would make me some fish and chips as she hadn't turned that off yet, and she would bring it to my room. What a lovely thoughtful girl! So, I dragged myself and my baggage all the way to my room, and was unpleasantly surprised at the state of it once opening the door. It was mouldy in the bathroom, not clean, the room smelt, and was just generally a dive. I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone...even if your expectations are low of a budget priced hotel, that should not mean bad service and conditions.

Stayed here at the beginning of 2014, and was pleased I did. The room although tiny , probably best for single occupancy, it was fully equipped with all I needed in the way of tea.coffee facilities etc, comfortable bed, modern decor, quiet, and the room plus bathroom were spotlessly clean. I also got room service from their own restaurant and had a gorgeous Indian meal. The price was good, the airport shuttle bus stops almost right outside ( tell the driver you are staying there and he will stop) and it is right in the heart of the city for easy walking access to everything. Would stay there again.

Well, what a lovely surprise! The owner was a lovely woman, friendly and helpful, and only to willing to come out in the rain to show us where our unit was ( motel unit 11). When we entered it was bright and fresh, modern decor, spacious, clean, with a kitchenette with everything we could possibly want, bathroom with nice free toiletries, separate couch area with freeview and wifi. The bed was comfortable, the room warm with no road noise, and we even got a meal from the Kingston Cafe just up the rd a few metres, and left the plates in our hotel room, as they have an understanding there, so it was like room service! We can't thank you enough for a lovely stay, and I am about to book my husband in again for another stay in a couple of days. We shall make sure we recommend Hectors to all as a much more budget conscious choice for those holidaying in Queenstown...only half an hour away. Thanks again for your professional yet family feel.

We stayed in Hectors in Kingston ( another review to come) which is just down the road from the cafe. Not only was the meal much better quality than we expected, my steak being a great size and cooked the way I like it to perfection ( medium rare), but also the Blue Cod my husband had was a great sized portion ( normally they are such tiny pieces) all served with excellently cooked chips, a salad, a coleslaw type salad, and tartare or other sauces. I had mushrooms on my steak. Now apart fro the fact this was lovely and I would rate it well, they had the kindness to let us take the meals, on their plates, to our motel room to eat! We were handed our meals, well wrapped in tinfoil, on a huge plate ( excellent portions like I said) and told to leave them in our room and they would sort it out from there! Brilliant! Thanks Ladies...good service is always rewarded.
Lisabug1964|72AE01FD54AA7AC9FCFAE9B58D9CD002|Restaurant|Clyde: Post Office Cafe & Bar|3| “Nice Memorabilia”|review_211278225|A large group of us stopped in for a morning coffee. It was lovely and warm inside with the fire going, a lovely feature. The large table we sat at was glass topped, with old post office items from yesteryear, and it was funny how many of them we had actually used ourselves. But unfortunately the drinks we ordered were just average, nothing special. The coffees were served with a choc/rum ball on the side, so that was a nice touch, but they were not very big, and tasted like preground beans. The smoothie and iced coffees were very average, something you would buy at the local dairy, so disappointing sadly. The prices were good. The woman serving us seemed a little nonplussed, not welcoming but not ignoring, just not really interested in serving us etc. All in all I would rate the cafe itself atmosphere wise an 8 out of 10, the drinks a 5 out of 10, the service a 7 out of 10. Would go again to try the food there are good reviews about, and hope to find a smiley face serving me next time.
Lisabug1964|72AE01FD54AA7AC9FCFAE9B58D9CD002|Hotel|Auckland: Jucy Snooze|5| “Excellent Value For Money”|review_207437466|I wasn't sure what to expect from this hotel. I thought it would be more like a backpackers, as they have hirecars with young people in them all over my region in the south, so I just assumed. Well, I was very pleasantly surprised! The room was bright and fresh and colourful. It was clean with crisp white sheets on the comfortable bed, and well stocked tea/coffee facilities on the table. The ensuite was huge, the shower had neverending hot water! We had all this plus a late checkout, plus 2 hours free wifi, all for just $59 on a Groupon special!! Now, don't get me wrong, this is no Hilton or 5 star boutique hotel, it is just a great value for money place. Also, it is very close to all you need, right in the city, plus a short walk from where we caught our cruise in Princes Wharf. Lovely reception staff also, who were very helpful in assisting us with bus timetables and food deliveries! Would definitely stay again, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend.

It was cheaper than anything else in Napier to stay at, with an ensuite, which is imperative as far as I am concerned. I found it to be very basic and outdated decor wise, but clean throughout the buildings. There is no fridge in the room, which was hard for me as I am a diabetic and needed to put my insulin in the fridge. There is a kitchen which is shared by all. ( so couldn't use the fridge there) It is basically a step up from a backpackers, with rooms to yourself with ensuites, but shared everything else. My room was clean, bed reasonably comfortable, so that was good. The other visitors were extremely noisy, which made it hard to sleep. All in all, a good place in the cheaper pricerange. I will spend a little more next time and stay elsewhere, to get the things I consider necessary. I would recommend if you are looking for this sort of accommodation.

Staff at shop will ask you for it if applicable for further discount.In case you don't have enough cash and aren't using your credit card, the information desk have currency exchange machine.There are 500 yen lockers big enough for 29 inch suitcases, if the ones at food court are full, there's also 800 yen ones near the bus stop which are probably even bigger.The bus to airport is only 200 yen from here.The main outlet place has expanded to a SEA side as well. the usual best places to shop are Nike, Adidas and Under Armour.Also found some nice stuff at the Japanese brands like Beams and United Arrows.Apart from these, me as a foreigner prefer Rinku Pleasure Town Seacle which has more standard casual shops, rather than European brands.Food court here was meh, probably the food court at Rinku Pleasure Town Seacle has better local food.

Since its 09:30pm, a lot of the fancy stuff were gone.We did manage to eat some that were very nice such as the Peony shrimp, but there was only 1 left. Crab leg was fairly nice as well.We also got 10% off the bill by following their LINE account, which I don't use usually, as simple as scanning the QR code and showing the coupon.

Actually just let the staff help, as they will do everything for you, so service is super good, I guess they serve foreigners very well, they also have Chinese and English menus if that helps.Please note a lot of restaurants close down on weekdays after lunch time for a few hours, this one remains open during the afternoon.After 4PM, smoking is allowed in store, as it's kinda pub style.The place is not very big either.

When we went to the counter to pay, the old lady took out tea cups and gave us samples for each type of tea we wanted to buy. So we ended up buying more than 1 pack of each.White strawberry juice taste just like strawberry juice, nothing to write home about.
Sam W|3C48C1536F580D1030F17518679BB3DB|Attractions|Osaka: Osaka Castle|4| “Osaka castle tour”|review_490989738|Going inside the castle is not a must.You pay a small fee for the ticket. Then you can walk up 8F or take the lift to 5F and walk up.The projections on 7F to tell the story is interesting.8F is the top floor balcony but with nets around there's not much to take photos of, you can surrounding park area and baseball field. You cannot use your camera on the 3F and 4F where the real artifacts and armors are. Toilets are only at 2F, and the 500yen dress up. For male you can pick a helmet however the dress is just a vest and the sword is a dummy. They only take 1 pic for you and they take many pics on your phone or camera BUT with the green background cloth. You can buy their photo for 1200yen that has the background keyed in.I do prefer this dress up compared with the free one in the park due to the helmet, but dress is disappointing in both slots.Females get a fake kimono with clip on butterfly instead of a tight waist cloth. Only 3 colors avail. Souvenir shop is at both 8F and 1F.
Sam W|3C48C1536F580D1030F17518679BB3DB|Attractions|Osaka: Osaka Castle Park|4| “Eat shop take pics”|review_490989671|The park is quite large from either stations it take about 15mins to reach the castle when walking fast.You can take a train car but I didn't bother seeing how much that was.When you arrive to the castle grounds, there's a huge shop there. They sell many snacks and souvenirs related to samurais and ninjas.In the ground the dress up general guy is avail for free photo. They can give you a vest and a hair band and a sword but its disappointing dress up so I paid to do the photo op in the castle instead, actually only difference is there's a helmet in the castle's one.Anyway background is of that general's flag and Osaka castle peeking over head.Food trucks sell the octopus balls and fried mochi on sticks and ice creams. Which is nice to stop for a quick snack before the long way back out.
Sam W|3C48C1536F580D1030F17518679BB3DB|Attractions|Osaka: Universal Studios Japan|5| “Really fun and prepared”|review_490863115|We went on a weekday in end of May, which is before their Cool Japan event ended in June.Although it is secondary school half term, there is a crowd but not an impossible one to deal with.We bought VIP entrance, park tickets, express pass x4, cool japan express pass x4.Firstly VIP entrance is something we did not need, as there is a queue on the right that let you access park like 30mins before hand. this was not the case on a not too busy day, the VIPs only entered the park like 15mins ahead of everyone else. Secondly, the VIP ticket we bought require us to pick them up as Harukas 300, which we didn't read the small prints to get the day before.Park tickets, you need this for QR code scan for entrance.Express pass x4, I wanted to buy Express pass x7 originally but it was sold out, so we settled with Express pass x4 Minion. It comes with Any time express for: Spider-man, Jurassic Park the-ride, Terminator or Backdraft and Minion Mayhem has a fixed time. Please note you cannot miss this time, they are strict on it when entering the express queue. For Spider-man, the queue is not long like 30mins and for express its almost within 10mins. We didn't go on Jurassic Park the-ride as its a wet one. Terminator is a waste of express pass, as it's a show not a ride, so the people queuing and ones using express has no difference in show times, except for if you want to sneak in just before the show starts.I wanted to get the express pass for Harry Potter Forbidden Journey, but it was sold out, so we queued for this one, it was like 40mins at the start of the day which is manageable. USJ on busy days queue time can be like 3 hours. Also note, on non busy days, you do not need a time pass to enter the Wizardary World of Harry Potter zone.You can make use of the single rider queue usually for Forbidden Journey as well as Hollywood dream- the ride (it was fast like 5mins queue but you don't know if the next roller coaster will be the normal one or the backwards facing one). We also did that for The Flying Dinosaur, but that single rider queue was longer like 30mins. It is one of the best roller coasters I've ever been on in terms of drop and G-force compared with US theme parks.Cool Japan events only happen after 12pm, since we had express passes for x4 all with timed entrance, we had to make a run for it after using the Minion one. Don't assume you can make it, if 2 express passes are at the same time, since you still have a bit of a queue inside the express queue.Evangelion XR is very cool with Samsung VR but a bit dizzy. The express pass is useful for rides.Monster Hunter queue is pretty short, so not much use of the express pass.Both Attack of the Titan (earlier showings) and Godzilla (later showings) uses the same 4D theatre to perform at, so same feedback as terminator, these you do not need much use of an express pass if you can make the show times.Don't forget to take the photo op with the titan or monster, as staff will help you take it on your phone cameras, and you don't have to purchase their printed photo.Food wise, snacks from USJ are all cool looking, as well as Cool Japan snacks.We did manage to get a sit down meal in between those express pass times at Finnegans the western pub. Green beer from Suntory taste a bit like beer + mouthwash.Overall if you don't want to risk the queue time, you must buy an express pass, as it is not like Tokyo Disneyland where you can go get fast passes of each ride from machines.

The price you pay for eat as much as you like is like the price of 2 plates.the egg dipping beef marinated in sukiyaki sauce is my favourite.The fatty slice of beef is a bit too fat for my taste.The minced wasabi or garlic beef short ribs is a bit weird, since these normally get burnt quickly and you have to scrap it off. But the sheet of ribs is very attractive.The cooked food like beef tendon, or sea urchin pumpkin spaghetti are not too special. There is a small amount of salad, pork, prawns but I didn't choose it, although the prawns look nice.The staff is helpful and changes your BBQ net quickly after few rounds.also please note, dessert selections are included.Drinks is only included if you pay another rate for free-flowing.

Most shops open till late, quite a lot of chain shops with their Osaka flagship store here. I particularly enjoy shopping at Jins, ABC-mart Grand Stage, Disney store.Clothing is okay, but trainer prices are ok everywhere in Japan.Restaurants, all along the side streets here.Didn't look into the pacinko places, but you can try getting some dolls if you want, its easier than other countries supposingly.Quite crowded, since its near many popular hotels, careful of those pushing luggages around.

They placed out 6 sets of towel and dress for us in advance! Each bag set comes with coffee, tea, comb, shaver, top, bottom, socks, more than adequate for each use. Superb service although I won't use all of it. A bottle of WATER comes in each pack too! Don't know what the tap water being magnetised means but I'm not drinking from there, so ok.Those cotton buds with 1 side as ear wax cleaning spoon are nice.The CONS is that Wifi is weak and drops off 90% of the time in room, I had my own Wifi connection so it's fine.There is a vending machine and smoking room on both 1/F and 2/F equipped with TV.The restaurant area does get noisy from babies, since this hotel is still considered high end of budget hotels. There is also drink machine for tea, green tea, coffee, hot or cold.I definitely like Dormy Inn and will consider booking the other ones for the sake of cheaper rates.

Razia C|C0721598916BAB3D849B764CC5E1A22B|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|4| “Be at the opening !”|review_476381134|We read the reviews of others and we were prepared ! 1st we did on a Monday with no vacation in Singapore to set the stage. You need to be there at the opening and do the most popular attractions like Transformers, Battlestar galactica and Mummies. From 11:00, queues are just awful even on a Monday. If you do not do that or it is weekend, take the express pass option (30 dollars single turn, 50 dollars unlimited). Queues will ruin your day. But in that case, i do not know if it is worth the overall price. Waiting time given for attractions is underestimated (multiply by min 1.5 or 2). In one day (8 hours) we did everything and kids enjoyed the time spent.Attractions are nice, overall experience good. We managed even to eat something other than fries which could be a challenge.

I found small flies in the room, the head shower of the tub was leaking a lot. And finally breakfast was very bad. I asked for coffee with milk that i never got. So finally for the price it is probably one of the worst deal in Abu Dhabi. Next time i will definitely choose another hotel even if it is a bit further from town, Abu Dhabi is not a big city to really care about that.

Since my kid has nothing to do with scenic locales boating was the only attraction for her. There is also a restaurant here from where we got breathtaking view of the lake. The only thing bad about this place is the roads.

The drive to reach it is pleasant with narrow dusty roads and minimal vegetation.This barren village has ruins of around 400 houses centered on the remains of a temple. The ruins of cremation grounds and a city wall can also be seen. During the 19th century, it was a prosperous village with water and vegetation. But what makes it shocking is that it became deserted overnight. According to legends, all the villages and their cattle left the village overnight without a trace.The emptiness is the first thing that hits us in Kuldhara. There is nothing but the crumbled beauty of a long-lost era. Ruin of 400 houses, stripped of splendor, each telling a tale of life that had existed in them earlier. The walls and ceilings that had once been the home of many happy lives and therefore full of life itself are now covered in black and brown mold, grime and dirt. The isolation is unsettling. The entire village is crypt quite, motionless and soundless. Once we climb the rickety stairs of a house we can see the entire village and only imagine what it once was. The cool breeze blowing from the desert makes it even more eerie. When we visited, there were hardly any tourists, only a handful of shepherd boys who were willing to talk about the mystery of the place for a meager amount.

We ordered for a cocktail and a mock-tail, both were refreshing and just perfect.For the main course we had the chefs special Lobster Thermidore and Crabcakes. Both were fresh, flavorsome and made to perfection. The portion sizes were good too. They even obliged my 4 Year old with complimentary potato wedges. The staff is very courteous and the best part of the experience was the complimentary ice creams served to us. It was like a topping on the cake.

It's a Club Mahindra Associated property so as a CM member we booked it thinking it will be like their other resorts so was disappointed. It's a hotel not a resort. The only recreation available was a decent size swimming pool in the hotels adjacent property. Nevertheless the hotel is good with good food. Had one of the best rogan josh there. The staff was courteous and quite accommodating with our demands of less spicy food. Works well as a transit hotel for us and not as a holiday destination.

The food in club 55 was beyond anything we expected and the views were amazing. Breakfast was delicious and the alcoholic drinks were generous. We were told on check in we had to take both our hotel keycards to access the pool and it is clearly stated on the paperwork to take them up, so I don't know how people missed that... Our room was clean and we had no issues with our keycard accessing the elevator or not working.I would definitely recommend staying here and I will be coming back again!

The fried zucchini was a winner though the fried calamari were soggy, with most of the coating falling off. My husband did not enjoy his pizza, but perhaps he was expecting a thinner, crisper crust. Pastas are available gluten-free. The carbonara had a refreshing lemon twist that gave this usually heavy dish an extra dimension. The pesto pasta was a hit with the kids. The chocolate cake was dry. I see from other reviews that we need to visit again to try the burrata.

The food comes quickly and during the wait the kids are kept busy with their activity sheets. It is always a stress-free meal here. The salads and antipasto platters are all winners. The pastas are quite tasty and cooked to a nice al dente. The risotto was slightly overdone on one occasion and way too soupy on another (on yet another occasion in the Wan Chai location the prawns were tucked into the rice, thereby waaay over-cooking them). This location offers a gluten-free crust for pizzas- a bit soggy on the occasion we tried this. There are certainly some interesting topping options such as Peking duck, but we did not venture far from the classics. Service is always friendly and attentive and seating is comfortable.

There was already a long queue for the tram but it moved quickly. We remained on the tram for the entire 40min ride and saw many animals up close. Had our kids been older and not such early risers we would have taken advantage of the walking trails. Tip: get tickets for the show before getting on the tram- space is limited.

The meat is juicy and flavourful but not overly salty, as often is the case of roast meats. Arrive 10-15min ahead of opening time for weekday lunch to avoid the queue. On a Saturday evening our party waited for 1hr for a table.

Garlicnaise is a must for the fries, which are a meal in itself. The kids love the zataar crisps. There isn't much seating available but diners are friendly here and will make room for you. I always feel full and healthy afterwards...a nice oasis in the neighbourhood.

For the price, the portions are small (my 5 year old can finish one bowl). Service is brisk and polite. As usual, bring your own tissues.

We did not purchase a fast-pass and only endured long waits for the Enchanted Airways junior roller coaster (not worth it for the short ride) and Jurassic Park Rapids (worth it- the line moves quicker than you would expect and no, you don't need to invest in a rain poncho). If you are one of the first to exit the Shrek 4D experience then you may not have to wait in line for the Magic Potion Ferris wheel ride inside the store. Everyone's favorite ride (5y-43y) was Transformers. Revenge of the Mummy is not for the faint of heart. The Sesame Spaghetti Space Chase was a cutest ride. Starbot cafe was the coolest restaurant and was the best place to enjoy molecular ice-cream. This was easily done in a day, probably half-day if investing in a fast-pass.

On the resort the kids enjoyed the pools, water slides, splash pad, beach, kayaking and paddle-boating. The staff at toots club were always warm and friendly, took good care of the kids and fed them well. The outdoor movie at night was a great way for the kids to wind-down. There is free transportaion on Sentosa as well as to VivoCity on the mainland. The kids loved the pirate ship splash pad on the island and Universal studios/aquarium is a short shuttle ride away. We took a 30min taxi ride to the Night Safari- apparently there is a $20 surcharge after 5pm for taxis....of which the taxi drivers don't tell you until you arrive at the destination! The breakfast buffet had Western, East Asian and South Asian selections, as well as a gluten-free section, non-dairy options and a laksa station. What a great way to start off each day! Our room was spacious and clean with a good-sized balcony overlooking the pool. Trees provided privacy and we had a quiet night's sleep daily. The complimentary fruit and beverages were a nice convenience- otherwise there is a store on the resort as well as a nearby 7-11 and grocery store in VivoCity. Even though the daily weather forecast called for thunderstorms and 90%POP, there was only 1 day out of 7 that it actually did rain during the day. The only reason I did not give this review 5 stars is that it didn't have the "glitziness" of 5-star resorts- I'd like to give it 4.5. However my family had a wonderful relaxing stay here and would definitely choose this resort again.

For the toddler and kids there is a play area and hands-on discovery zone, bat cave and dinosaur dig. There is a large exhibit on dinosaurs with interactive screens that allow you to learn more about each specimen- the kids really liked that. We also visited the Chinese exhibit in our limited time there. The Chulily exhibit was really impressive and there is an informative documentary. You can even purchase a souvenir for 10K(!) in the gift shop. (When we were there someone actually purchased 2!) I have to mention that I was very impressed with the meal selection available at the café. Many healthy options done well as well as a plethora of desserts available, including vegan. By far the best museum cafeteria I have visited. If you are planning on visiting several attractions, consider a Citypass. Otherwise you can save $3/ticket on attractionsontario.ca In terms of kids-play, my 5 and 7 year olds prefer the science centre.

I often order this at Japanese restaurants and the version here was perfectly cooked and seasoned with a generous portion size. It came with rice, soup and appetizer of pickled vegetables. My husband ordered the sushi lunch, which was fresh and tasty. Dessert is frozen mochi. Service was quick and attentive. I wanted to go back for the same meal the next day! A bit on the expensive side but well worth the value.

We had a harbour corner room and perhaps if we were a few floors higher, could have had a better view of the harbour. As guests, we were given a mobile phone that had internet and allowed for free calls internationally. That saved us from having to purchase a roaming plan. The hotel is directly connected to City Plaza, a large mall with shops, grocery store and many dining options (we tried and can recommend Peking Garden and Ichikawa). The Taikoo subway station is also located a few steps outside the front door. My only heads-up for the modest is that there is only a glass partition between the shower and sleeping area (all very stylish, open-concept) in our particular room.

We had a 1hr wait for a table. There was plenty of room at the bar to pass the time. I ordered the lump crab cake and filet mignon, which had a nice crust, was tender and flavourful. The crab cake was composed of juicy morsels of crab. My husband ordered the special grilled Mahi Mahi, which had a nice char and flavor, if a bit on the dry side. I would have liked to have tried the flourless waffle except the waiter handed us the bill before asking if we wanted dessert! The mojito was good.

We ordered the seafood paella (order one portion for sharing so that you can try more tapas). It was well-seasoned with just the right texture for the rice. The seafood was tender, though I wish the mussels were plumper. The favourite tapas of the night was the octopus that had a fragrant smoked paprika flavor and paired well with potatoes. The trio of mushrooms was flavourful. The short ribs, though tasty and tender, did not stand out from what we have sampled at other restaurants. The croquettes were a bit on the salty side. A pleasant surprise was the decadent flourless chocolate dessert- so glad we ordered it! We will definitely be back to try more dishes. The sangria was lovely, as was the attentive service.

It is always busy anytime around meal times, service is attentive and friendly and prices are reasonable. The sushi and maki are well done, though not high-end, and the presentation is simple (compared to Katsura at Westin Prince which I reviewed last week). However, the standard is consistent and the meal is satisfying.

The menu offers a good selection of starters, sushi and combo plates. We opted to start with the agedashi tofu and spicy tuna roll. The tofu was crispy on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth inside, served in a warm broth whose flavor did not overpower the tofu at all. The tuna roll was not as spicy as expected but lovely all the same. For the main course we ordered the shikigozen bento box and suyatem plate. The shikigozen is a tower of three bento boxes presented beautifully, containing sashimi, tempura and marinated black cod, as well as cooked vegetables and pickled items. The sashimi was so smooth, the tempura was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside (even the last pieces at the end of the meal) and the black cod was heavenly and a meal on it's own (reminds me of a tapas dish served at Cava). The vegetables were cooked to perfection. The mains come with the usual soup, salad and ice-cream. In retrospect, we ordered way too much food, but I imagine that next time I will not be able to resist ordering the shikigozen and agedashi tofu again....it has been a week and I am still thinking about it. Service was excellent.
JJ22Toronto|8E29CFA47673EE553C94D993E0FA9111|Attractions|Mont Tremblant: Mont Tremblant Resort|4| “Fun Summer vacation with kids”|review_215084448|I was initially a bit skeptical about spending a week at Tremblant with two young kids (3 and 5yrs) but was pleasantly surprised by how the week filled up with fun activities despite a few rainy days. Both kids loved the luge (definitely get a multi-ride package because it is true: one descent is not enough!). My 5yr-old also did the acropark obstacle course (just the right amount of difficulty for this age) and eurobungee (better for slightly older kids). There is a tall climbing wall, but also a free, small one, for which my kids were better suited. The kids also enjoyed riding the boats in Lac miroir. On two rainy days we spent the afternoon at the indoor aqua park. There is a splash pool with a slide and two deeper areas as well as outdoor pools and hot tub. There are life jackets and toys. We also spent a rainy morning at Studio Creatif, a paint-your-own pottery place, where you buy an item (price range $12 and up) and pay $10/hr to paint it. If you plan on taking the gondola to the summit (amazing view!) bring a a sweatshirt since it is quite chilly and windy up there even when it is hot in the village (we ended up having to buy sweatshirts at the shop at the summit). We also saw the Birds-of-Prey show, where we saw an eagle, vulture, chouette, and owl up-close. Consider getting a multi-activity card, worth the most value if you spend it on the more expensive activities such as aquapark, gondola. We stayed a Les Manoirs and was very happy with the accommodations, and though we may have gotten a better value by cooking in the condo, we mostly ate at the village (Moms need a vacation too, right?) La forge turned out to be our best bet in terms of selection, location, service and price. Casey's had 1/2 price burgers on Wednesdays between 4-7pm and had good ribs. Puesta del sol offers corn tortillas instead of flour, if you ask. Bullseye had good burgers. Spaghetti and Co has gluten-free pasta. Smoke's poutinerie and Pita Express were a bit of a disappointment for us. I recommend taking the cabriolet (free) to the top of the village when you first arrive and then walk down the main strip to get an overall idea. After walking from les Manoirs on the first day with a bike trailer (though there is a free shuttle every 45min), we opted for the $15 parking (in/out privilege) and didn't bother with the trailer or stroller at the village. This was a relaxing outdoor vacation for us. When the kids are older we will return and hope to take advantage of the biking and hiking trails.

Our 5yr-old spent most of the time at the mini-club where activities include swimming, circus school, trapeze, dance, and art. There is a daily schedule so we were able to check on her at anytime or sign her out if we wanted to do something as a family. Lindsay and Cindy were particularly lovely GO's with the kids. In general all of the GO's were friendly and made this resort a happy place. Though there are child-care services for younger kids, we kept our 2yr-old with us and she enjoyed playing at the beach, the splash pad, mini-golf, mini-tennis and having a slushy drink and goldfish crackers at the Slice bar. Our room was well-thought out and functional, with 2 daybeds and crib, a stroller, diaper change pad and baby bath. The A/C was quite noisy at night but didn't seem to bother the kids since they kept sleeping-in later and later each night we were there. There was a good selection at the main restaurant at each meal (buffet style). Breakfast stayed the same each day, but in my books, any meal that has crispy bacon is a great meal. Love the fruity quinoa- will have to try that at home. Try to make reservations at the table-service Riverside Grill as soon as you arrive. There are lots of activities to choose from- tennis, golf, volleyball, fitness classes, sailing, paddleboard, trapeze. Gino mixed a good balance of humor with some seriously helpful tips at the tennis clinic. The golf instructor gave me some tips on one day that kept me practicing the rest of the week. The golf course can be a bit slow. Fernando's zumba class is a fun workout. Book a massage at the spa to recover from all the activity! I highly recommend this resort if you plan to take advantage of the activities offered. If you are looking for a romantic getaway this may not be the best option. For us this was a great family vacation destination-we will definitely be back!

The short rib hash was a winner for two of us, two others enjoyed the Benny. We didn't hear much about the pizza and pasta, which must mean they were good! The sausages we ordered as a side were really heavy on Rosemary and I was the only one willing to take them home (tossed with pasta it made a great dinner). Kids were offered coloring pages and the kids' meals were either pancakes or pasta. We opted to order sides for the kids instead (choices include bacon, potatoes, aforementioned sausages, yogurt with fruit, ciabatta). Coffees were good and hot chocolate was available with soy milk. PS. Don't be alarmed to see someone of the opposite sex washing hands at the sink when you open the washroom door- men's and women's washrooms lead out to communal sinks.

Service is attentive but not rushed. The menu is not too adventurous but has something for every taste. The scallop and smoked duck as well as the short rib appetizer were a bit pricey for the portion size. There are gluten free options for pastas, though on one occasion, the capellini could have used an extra minute. The food is generally well prepared but not blow-your-socks-off. The restaurant has always been busy and filled with happy chatter on the weekends that I have been there and the crowd is a mix of well-dressed couples, family, or good friends. Overall, good experiences here.

They have appologized and hopefully learned from it) we decided to take our kids (2 and 4yrs) on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. There is a very large play area with sandbox, slides, trikes and more that kept the kids happily and independently entertained for an hour. Though there is no fee for entrance to the premises, there is a $2.50 fee per person (including adults) to enter the play area. The great thing is that steps away is the apple orchard- no need to wait for a tractor, drag a wagon (available on premises) uphill, and no complaints of "my knees are tired". Tractor rides, corn maze each costs $1. There is a country store that has good apple pie (the only item I can vouch for). Waiting in the long lineup to make our purchase from the store as well as the long lineup to pay for our apples was ridiculous. The kids had a great time though.

I was very excited the first day to snap up some mixed berry pie and gf loaf of bread. The rest of the week offered the same carrot cake and a wonderful morning glory muffin. I wish there was more selection. Everyone else enjoyed the croissants (plain, cheese, chocolate, ham & cheese, almond). The cookies were tempting as were the colorful macarons. They are also at the garrison lane farmer's market on Saturday mornings.

There is a good selection of gelato and sorbets (even chocolate, though by nature sorbets lack the creaminess that compliments chocolate flavors best). A must-try!

For the thirsty, there are 22 beers on tap and other drinks are generous. The food comes out pretty fast, especially the kids' meals and portions are big. They advertise themselves as having the best fish and chips- the basa was moist while the coating was crisp (though a bit heavy). The grey hunk of lamb shank did not look very appetizing (could have used a glaze or sauce) but was very tender and the accompanying vegetables were on the salty side. They seem to do better with pastas and fish than with meat.

There were 4-5 rides that the kids liked and the main show was captivating. Visitors can really get up-close to the animals, feeding the deer, bison, elk and bears. Strollers are a must since there are long walks between attractions. The restaurant offers the usual fare as well as roast chicken and the lineup was long even on the Wednesday that we went. Eat healthier and save $$ by bringing your own picnic lunch. Do get a frozen lemonade for the long walk back to the exit.

Another reason to come early is that the food takes a while to come. Fortunately there are coloring books for the kids. There is a stone oven that churns out pretty good pizza and the pastas were good. My duck was nicely done though the dish did not come with chorizo as indicated on the menu (not sure why since chorizo, as far as I know, is not a seasonal item). The crab cakes were flavorful though shaped quite tall so the sides were not browned at all- I prefer them less thick and evenly crispy around the outside. The strip loin was average. Overall everyone enjoyed their food and wines and the service was friendly.

Each flavor is also labeled with symbols indicating the presence of lactose/gluten/egg etc.... And the times we have been there, there were 6 options which had no symbols, making this a great destination if you have many dietary restrictions. So far mango, grapefruit, lemon, apricot, pistachio are all winners for us and we'll be back to try out the rest. The coffee is also good. The staff is friendly and very helpful in answering any questions. They also make milkshakes, have ice-cream bars and ice-cream sandwiches. There is limited seating so this is more of a take-out place.

There is also a small patio out back. The food is pre-made but reheated well. The gf boxty was filled with flavorful chicken curry that had just the right amount of heat. The gf salmon cakes were also tasty. The mushroom and celery soups were dairy free. The dessert case had many gf options. The date-squares were dairy/egg free. Service was super-friendly and quick.

The pork special was delicious though the salmon could have used 30s less cooking time. Overall, a bit heavy-handed on the salt. Veggies were done just right with a good amount of crispness in the beans to convey a fresh flavor. The kids' chicken fingers were "just like the ones you make, mom" and the grilled cheese was a hit. Fries were good. There is a good selection of beer on tap. Prices are pretty reasonable. Service could have been a bit friendlier.
JJ22Toronto|8E29CFA47673EE553C94D993E0FA9111|Attractions|Stevensville: Safari Niagara|4| “Fun day for the kids”|review_170060397|This is a perfect "zoo" for young kids (our group had a 4yr old, 3yr old, 2yr old, 18m old). There are all the standard big zoo animals (lions, tigers, giraffes, hippos, no elephants) in walkable distance and there is also a tram, but later in the day the tram gets full. Getting there earlier in the day also helps to avoid lineups on rides (carousel, boats, planes) and the climbing apparatus (there is a mini one for the 3-5yr range and a bigger one for the older kids). There is a big splash pad (with very cold water) that all the kids enjoyed and a sizable playground area. The change room is small, unlit and have no bathrooms (odd). There are actually only 2 bathrooms in the entire zoo- at the concession stand and at the entrance, both with only 2-3 stalls. Otherwise port-a-potties are located throughout. Better/more washrooms would make this a much better experience. The food is average (pizza, burgers, hotdogs, chicken fingers) and there are lots of picnic tables if you don't mind lugging a cooler around. Highlights for us include feeding the giraffes and the free-flying budgies. This is our second time here and a good improvement is the all-inclusive aspect of the day-pass. We got half-price tickets on groupon (though still had to pay tax at the gate) and $3-off coupons can be found

The lamb tagine has a nice kick to it and the morsels of meat and veggies are oh-so-tender with just the right amount of sauciness to be served over rice. The portions are quite hearty so even though I was very full, I had to try the house-made pecan pie- the pecan dotted crust of the pie filling itself was glorious and not your mushy run-of-the-mill kind. Loved it! My only negative about the meal was that the grilled pita was served with a cold hard hummus which was pretty to look at but I prefer room temperature dip, perhaps with some dribbles of olive oil. My server Becky was just the right amount of attentive. My room was spacious with a separate dressing/bathroom area. Everything, though not modern, was tasteful and clean. There was a nice gas fireplace that kept the room cozy and big windows to let the sun in when the curtains were opened. The bed was comfortable and I had a great sleep until the grandfather clock struck 6 o'clock.....anyway, breakfast was beautifully presented- eggs any way you like with a perfectly crisp strip of bacon and sausage and a good amount of fruit. I wonder if they serve breakfast to non-guests as well?

On the day of arrival, we received a text a little before 1pm informing us that our room was ready. I was so relieved to have our room in which to change and get organized with our two young kids before heading to the waterpark instead of having to find our way around the resort to change rooms and store our belongings in lockers. The waterpark had small slides that my daughter could go down by herself, a wave pool, and a "river" in which she could ride on inner tubes, all being able to touch the bottom of the pool. There were also ample lifejackets of various sizes. My 18month-old did not like being in the cold water too much so after some time in the hot tub and floating down the river (look-out there are pails dumping water near the end!) we dried off and headed to the cub club where there was a good selection of toddler toys and art activities. We spent some time in the arcade before dinner. There were quite a few games that my kids were able to play. The dinner buffet had a good selection to cater to all tastes (though a little heavy on the salty side) and the price was comparable to what one would have paid at any other family sit-down restaurant. Kids under 4 eat for free. After dinner, don't miss storytime at 8pm and get there early to get a good seat. We booked the Wolf Den room and my daughter couldn't wait to get into her bunk bed to sleep (the extra cost for this themed room was well-worth it). As for me, I thought the pillows were too high and had a hard time falling asleep. In the middle of the night the heater (about 2ft from my side of the bed) went on and kept blowing cold air. I finally decided to get up to turn in off, but to my chagrin, the control was located on the wall-thermostat located directly above where we had placed the playpen. I was successful after some quiet acrobatics over a sleeping toddler. For breakfast, we had cereal in our room (there is a mini fridge to store milk). Before checking out we changed into our swimsuits, loaded our luggage and coats into the car, rented a locker in which to put our valuables and headed to the waterpark again to finish off our stay. The drive to the GTA area is a perfect nap-length for tired-out kids. We will definitely be back for a longer stay!

I had to order naan for $1.50 (and was given half of a naan) and no drink was included. The flavour of the chicken was good, but $6.50 for a kids' meal without a drink is a bit steep.

We arrived late at night and despite negative reviews on this site about lousy front-desk service, we were attended to promptly. We were given a spacious ocean-view room in the tower. The bed was very (too) soft and I felt that the entire room had a smokey smell, despite it being a non-smoking room. We took a nice stroll along the still busy boardwalk that night and returned to the hotel casino for (overpriced) noodles at the noodle bar. Not being much of a gambler, we took a walk down the boardwalk in the opposite direction the next morning but couldn't stand the heat and decided to head into town to the outlet shops. My impression is that AC is really for the gamblers and not for casual tourists like ourselves. However, if you are a tourist, Bally's was a good location because it is centrally located on the Boardwalk and close to shopping.

We have never stayed at a B&B before and after some friendly email correspondence with the owners, we decided to give B&B a try. We stayed 2 nights and were the only guests at the time. However, of the 3 rooms, we were not given a room with an ensuite bathroom. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom nextdoor was clean and spacious. We were particularly anticipating a hearty breakfast, but were disappointed with our choice of cereal, bananas and muffins our first morning. The second morning we had some good bagels and cinnamon coffee-cake. We had expected a hot breakfast- even just simply eggs and maybe some bacon or sausage. There was a common room where we were free to lounge and watch satellite TV. The owners recommended the nearby Captain's Table for dinner, and we found it a little dingy and not particularly good. We chose this location mainly because it was only about a 5-10min drive to Woodbury Commons but now know that there is also Hampton Inn located even closer.

We arrived late at night from Paris on the Eurostar, which stops at Waterloo Station, a few minutes' walk from the hotel. Check-in was quick and smooth, though we had to pay for our room up-front. Our room was huge, especially in comparison to the tiny room we had in Paris. There was a loose tile under the carpet, in front of the bathroom door- not too much of a bother. The bathroom had a bit of a weird smell. It bothered me the bathroom door doesn't stay open (something about the steam setting off the fire alarm...speaking of which, there is a test alarm each Thursday morning at 10:30am). The closest U is steps away at Waterloo station, while Westminster Abbey & station is just across the bridge. We did not have breakfast or any other meals at the hotel- there are many options nearby.

The only issue I encountered will probably be the delay in flights (usually happens in the summer), but my latest trip went well (even earlier than my scheduled flight). Their "piso fare" flights are actually what makes me grateful to this airline. They make the usually 'expensive' flight tolerable in terms of money. I also like their desk support staff, they're very friendly :D The only problem would probably be a bit of humidity in their aircraft.

It is actually the gateway towards the different attractions in Sentosa Island. It is usually hot inside the island but resorts world is actually cooler in temperature. The restrooms are also great and abundant and it is actually a great place to chill.

It has different attractions (sci-fi, shrek, ancient egypt, jurassic world, etc.) and not only kids can enjoy this place, adults will also definitely will. They have numerous rides per attraction and gift shops as well. Their humongous architectural structures are also a must-see (especially in ancient egypt).

They have a variety of activities (rides, food stalls, exhibits, etc.) which you can enjoy all day long. The most fun part here though is their Star Wars section where you can find all key events in every Star Wars episode displayed artistically in separate rooms and complete with sound and light effects. The rides were also great and the staff were always very accommodating. Although one should wear sunblock here because there are no covers and most of the time, the sun is hot and up in the sky. But all in all, a great experience.

False advertising at its finest!!!”|review_476240237|If I could give a zero or a below zero rate, I would. We went here for a family trip this April 2017. We already bought tickets and got a cabana but to our horror, their 2 pools were a crowded mess! We understand that it's a Sunday and a holiday but the size of their pool is inexcusable. It can just probably fit 20 people or less (and they have to be standing up just so they can experience the pool). The other pool was tolerable (the one with slides) BUT with the amount of people that they're letting in, I'm sure that it's too obvious that the amount of guests will not fit in that one pool. I don't even know if they have any idea when it comes to ratio. Their huts, tables and cabanas are plenty, yet their 2 pools are limited in size and space. This is considering that they have a huuuuggge parking space (which I think should have been used for another pool) Then we also availed their billiard (pool) service and paid for it. The staff told us to just give the ticket to the one handling the billiard. When we went there, the staff told us to wait for 3 1/2 hours to play!!! If they told us earlier that we had to wait, we wouldn't have availed any. So, all of us are already fuming at this point. We packed our bags, headed to our car and left this resort. Our day was spoiled and what was planned to be a family get-away turned into a sour trip. Their website was full of promising experiences, turns out to be false after all. Will NEVER recommend this resort to anyone. Cheers!

Everything was very clean and organized, and the staff were very nice as well. They were quick in answering all of our inquiries. But what we appreciated the most is probably the "free breakfast". They were just toasts, eggs, jams, butter, peanut butter, coffee, and hot and cold water but we appreciated them a lot since all of the food in Singapore are expensive :D They also tasted good (the free breakfast) and come in many stocks. This hostel was worth our money and is also strategically located near Mustafa center and lavender station (there are food courts there) which made our stay much easier. Will definitely book here again in the future :D

That's where it stops. Like any tourist attraction the aim is to make money, making the place contested from the outset. People are rude and pushy, some children were even pushed aside. The fish are great when you can look at them (when) people aren't being rude. It would be fantastic if there were tickets sold in groups, then a waiting time for the next group so the place isn't packed. You are on an island with heaps to do, I don't think it would bug anyone.

The hotel doesn't have a parking so I had to go around the street to find a place. The hotel rooms are new with comfortable furniture, however they were cold. In the hotel there is some construction going on and this was disturbing, a lot of noise and constantly workers were going in and out of the hotel. The furniture in the lobby were a bit over the top and in my opinion ugly. The reception staff were polite. The breakfast it is not worth the money. It cost me €8 and i didn't even consume any of the food provided. There isn't a lot of choice. Overall this is an average hotel, it is okay for a day.

The hotel staff are extremely rude specially at the reception. When I arrived at the hotel the receptionist was rude and later that day I called the reception a couple of times and I couldn't get a hold of anybody. I used the room number to call the reception but nobody picked up so I started to use my mobile phone. When i got a held of the receptionist he was questioning me why called from my mobile phone, like I had to explain it to him. I then asked him if there is room service and the receptionist replied to me why do you need a room service when the restaurant is one floor above you. Just get up from your bed and go and eat in the restaurant. As a guest of the hotel I should be taken care of even if there is no room service he could of politely replied to me. The restaurant menu is very limited and there is a very little to choose from. The food was a big disappointment for what I payed. I requested a receipt and the waiter did not want to give it to me. This was something which really pissed me off. The breakfast is okay. The internet in the hotel is absolutely dreadful. I had to wait about 10 minutes to load an email. The shower it is very inconvenient. Before a shower you don't have anywhere to hang your towel unless you put it on the floor. After a shower the water doesn't drain for about 10-15 minutes. The two good thing about this hotel is the location, which is opposite the main train station and that the rooms are modern but still they are really cold. Overall I do not recommend this hotel I had booked it for 3 days and the rude staff, the bad service and the cold room made me regret it.

The hotel is really clean and the food is delicious. We only had breakfast but from what we saw the food was good. We went to a spa and we bought a package for 3000 bata, which about $88 and it was for 2:30 hours for two people. The spa was absolutely fantastic, the package included 10 min steam bath, 50 min body scrub, 60 min back massage and 50 min face massage plus a face mask. The only thing the hotel didn't have was a shisha bar and for me this was a minus. Overall the hotel was good and if we are coming back to Patong we will stay again in Deevana Plaza Phuket.

Unfortunately we were really tired and we didn't see the whole garden. It is a great place for a day out with the family.

First let me start by saying that all of the staff are very polite and they take such a good care of all of the guest staying in the hotel. The food is delicious. There is a rich variety for both breakfast and dinner. The curries they offer are one of the best once i ever had. All of the areas of the hotel are very clean including the rooms. There is shisha on the outside restaurant next to the pool and it is about 1900 rupi which is about $13. There is animation in the hotel for both children and adults during the whole day. The spa is also something that you should not miss as they are not expensive and they are fantastic. The hotel is right on the beach and offers the opportunity to have dinner by the Indian Ocean and this is something which my family and I really enjoyed. We were really lucky that we found a local tuk tuk driver who took us around Bentota, a turtle farm and even to Kandy. He organised for us a couple of trips we went to Kandy to ride elephants, to see a tea factory, to see the botanical garden and to one of the biggest temples in the Area. I have attached his business card if you are visiting Sri Lanka I highly recommend to use Gayan's services. We tried a couple of tuk tuk drivers but they were either driving too fast or they weren't as nice as Gayan. On one of the days we organised from the hotel a boat safari in the jungle and this was also a great activity, which we really enjoyed. Overall this has been ana amazing holiday for us. The Centara Ceysands Resort has everything you need and the staff are absolutely amazing. We'll definitely will be back.

Disappointing. ”|review_477027033|With so many options in Sentosa island, I recommend choosing somewhere else. I have stayed at many of the shangri la hotels and this one by far was the worst. Upon our arrival we were greeted to a congested foyer. We were taken to our room which heavily smelt of mildew. We thought maybe it was us and left if. The next day it was much worse and we asked to be moved. We were treated as though we were tying to get a free upgrade. The rooms were not modern and cramped. My daughter had a huge accident and her moth was severely cut. She was gushing our blood. We rang up front desk and no one answered!! When we went down we were told they were busy. Unacceptable! They helped organising a taxi to the hospital. Upon returning my husband explained we were disappointed with the service and couldn't believe how they handled the situation, and their general service.After coming from the jw Marriott where the service was impeccable this was a complete let down.Also we payed for breakfast and nothing could be eaten as even though it was "halal" it was cooked with pork.Overall a 1/10 and I will not be refunding.I advise everyone to find other accomodation

The view from our cabin on the far right side of the resort was truly breath taking. The facilities are very good, bathroom is clean and updated and the furniture is modern and new. In saying that the down sides to this hotel are:* very very uncomfortbale bed, feels like there is a piece of wood under the mattress. Being pregnant made it even worse.* There is a wall mounted aircon, which is very hard to regulate the temperature. It's either to cold or to hot. Also the light does not turn off on the led and lights up the entire room.* The television has a blue light when on stand by which makes the room very bright and hard to sleep. You need to physically cover it.* the shuttle bus would take on average 8 mins to get to us, and we often needed to double call to ask where it was.* the Internet is Shocking!! The wifi keeps dropping out and won't let you join. When it does the speeds are extremely slow.In saying that everything else is very good. By far this is the best breakfast I have eaten during my stay in Malaysia and the monkeys are just stunning.

The view looks good but that's about the only things I can plus this hotel.As soon as you arrive at the hotel, you are overwhelmed with a gross smell of fish and chicken which has come from across the road at the daily market.You check in, and are immediately given the impression this hotel is for locals who have their conferences here and NOT for tourists.You checkin and find the no wifi is included as part of the expensive amount you paid to stay in the hotel. You go up to your room and are greeted with overwhelming smell of mould. I'm pregnant so my smell is heightened, but my husband also said it was bad.The rooms are nothing spectacular. We were told The blinds don't close as the windows are tinted, but this Dosent help you when the sun shines in at 6.30 am. On the last night here I found out they do close! I was not impressed.Our toilet became blocked, our sink would not take down the water. We had to call repairman twice! Our bathroom has mould in it, the bathroom sink stopped working and wouldn't suck down the water.Our room only had one robe and was a size 0. Being pregnant I couldn't even get it on!! Take my advice and don't stay here. Yesterday we saw the shangri la rasa resort when viewing the orangutang and were blown away with the amazing resort and beach. This hotel is not worth it and such a disappointment. I'll be informing my travel agent about this and their poor choice of hotel recommendation. Also don't book any tours through these people.

The room was in good condition, and the location is perfect. A rally nice view. However there were a few problems. 1. The elevators took a long long time to arrive. Considering there are 6 you can but wonder why. The hallways are not airconditioned so you are standing in humidity for a long time. 2. The airconditioning decided to sometimes be cold, and sometimes not work. 3. The hot water was awful. Needed to be switched on 5 Mins before use, however ended up taking an hour to get hot at least. 4. The shower did contain a lot of mould and build up. Overall, the hotel was a very good location. There was a constant amount of taxis, and a huge shopping centre underneath you. So if you are bored or hungry there is always something to do. Also the hotel spa was amazing and cheap.

I went in to order a pie, which was amazing. However the girl servin was rude, did not ask if she could help me and practically threw the pies on the counter and walked away after I paid. Would go back for a pie, but weary due to poor customer service.

I thought it was amazing however I was disappointed to find how short it was.

I was recommended it, and thought my travel agent was correct despite the reviews as it was the "most popular" selling.As soon as I got there I was disapointed to find that there was not air con in the lobby. It was collet however still very hot. Our room was not ready and we has to wait for 5 hours and this is after being on 2 planes for over 12 hours!We were brought to our room. The room had a nice view however nothing else much more spectacular. I expected a jacuzzi which is sea facing. Don't be fooled. It was a nicely worded small spa bath which has shutters that open and perhaps if you uncomfortably tilt your head you may catch a glimpse of the ocean.We were VIP guests and there was no special treatment, no special welcome ect that you would find at another hotel.Don't order room service. It is disgusting! The room itself was falling upart. There were huge paint chips on the wall, mouldy bathrooms, Internet and telephones which don't work properly. You feel as though you are in a 2.5 star hotel. Don't be fooled!!Finally our air conditioner stopped working. For over an hour we waited while it was trying to be fixed. The technician was a wonderful man who tried his best however or would not be fixed so we were "upgraded" to another room. Even though the room had an additional bathroom and lounge there was no view. I was so upset about this! I paid for the view, not to sit in another additional room.The shutter bus is also not reliable, they are bad drivers and sometimes don't even show up! My advices is to look into another hotel.I would not stay here ever again!

It is dirty everywhere, there is no organisation, the poor animals were in small tiny dirt tanks while people were knocking on the glass and flashing cameras. No respect for house rules.When you come to the end of the tour you have people trying to pull you on to buy things.To be Honost a waste of time and money. Don't bother with this trip.

They assist you of you are worried or scared and try to make you feel as comfy as possible.My only complain is my food is not very good if you are a vegetarian. But every boat serves the same food. Also the group you travel with makes a big difference. My group this time were not friendly and this overall dampened the happiness of the day but that's just pot luck!Highly recommend you try posioden

I agree with the other reviews that thank god not all coffee clubs are the same. I will be glad to be back in Sydney where they make good coffee. And it's not only the beans that make good coffee it's the amount of milk and barristers skill. Fail in my opinion

The staff is very bad , not polite to the guests. It seems that we come here for free admission. We have to wait for 2 hours until our queue, the machine is out of order. We have to be new queue when it starts working. Again when it is raining, stopping for raining , we must stand a new queue again and again. When it is raining, no umbella, no staff, no way to go to restroom. No staff helping at Taxi stop outside. The guest service desk at universal should have duty to help the customer but she is not polite and cannot help anything, just say that nonrefundable, everyone must be in queue and it has more 4 hours before they will be closed, we have time to play more and we should accept term and condition in ticket. You should write the condition in the ticket that which machine is out of order and waiting time is at least 2 hours per machine. We pay 6 pax tickets but get nothing, unfair for tourists. I will write 100 bad reviews to this Universal Singapore. The Singapore Universal is the bad universal in the world.

More than enough. The stories, waterfall and flowers were all beautiful and interesting but if there were no other tourists you could be in and out, seeing everything in 25 min. The biggest downside are the mindless "selfie" army. Hundreds of people just stopping in the middle of walkways to take pics, with no coherence to the fact they are blocking multiple that people.... But I suppose when tou put something beautiful on display the masses will come and they will need to Instagram... So not much you can do about that :)

Relatively easy to get to and you are able to barter the prices down with a lot of the stores, but all in all i wouldn't go out of my way to get there. It's very busy and from what i looked at (spending about 2 hours looking at a lot of stalls with my wife) the quality of majority of the products was nothing to write home about. Fun experience and definitely a place for cheap souvenirs and bits and moms but not a highlight of singapore for me.

Single rider, not express!”|review_476056371|Arrived at 9.30ish with tickets in hand and was about 5 or 6 people back in our specific line (There are about 6 lines). By 10 when it opened there were a good 30+ people per line. We went in and straight to the dueling roller coasters, no line what so ever on either. We then went to transformers.... 30 min wait. Not ideal but okay. After that a lot of the bigger rides had a 25-35 min wait so we started looking at express pass, but after seeing in a tripadvisor post that it was 60 dollars pp we decided to rather try "single rider" option and boy was this a game changer!! Went on about 4 rides single rider style. So you don't get to sit with your friend/wife/family, BUT we waited on average 5 min when the lines were often 30 or even 40 min long. GAME CHANGER as long as you dont have young kids. Just do it and thank me later :) only other thing is take your own water, we didn't and its pricey in there at between 3.50 and up to 6 dollars at some spots.

It is one of the old Bombay heritage and one can always find it fascinating historically. It also proudly displays bullet marks to commemorate those killed in the deadly Mumbai terrorist attack in 2008. So gazing at those marks will help you reconnect with history and the friendly staff and an always crowded place, with will reassure you with the strong spirit of hope in Mumbai.

For those who are from outside the city, it is the place where you can catch the Mumbaikar spirit and blend in with the locals. It is a very loud, colourful place full of interactions with hawkers. A fun place to purchase cheap souvenirs and just get to live like a local for some time!
Prarthana D|6742F9B697D5D0BAC24348FFE2CF2302|Attractions|Mumbai (Bombay): Kanheri Caves|4| “Insight into Indian History”|review_475738541|The caves are epitome of the culture and art of the folks who once lived here. Located in the midst of the national park, it is easily accessible through Sanjay Ghandi National park either via walking or a form of transport! The caves are the main attraction and the carvings although not too well maintained are quite intricate. You can get tickets for the heritage site from the gate itself.

As a local person, I think Marine drive would be my number 1 choice to go to for an escapism time! The walkway gets more alluring with beautiful sunrise/ sunset sights and there are plenty of things to do- walk, sit on the benches facing the sea, feel the sea wind in your hair, munch on street snacks or unwind with your friends! Not many places can offer such versatility now, can they?

The lighting at night gives the bridge more pronounced look! Although it has to be noted that you are not allowed to stop on the bridge for any amount of time as it might clog up the traffic.

The Greenwich University campus is a must. The architecture and history is fascinating as it was acting as the Royal Naval base during the World war era's. The Greenwich prime meridian also crosses the land at the observatory just located a few steps away.

Prarthana D|6742F9B697D5D0BAC24348FFE2CF2302|Attractions|London: The London Eye|5| “Brilliant views at night”|review_475728102|The lighting, the people, the colours- what's not to like? If you can brave the chill of the late evening, I would highly recommend visiting this attraction just to see the nightscape of the city. The city lights up and you can just take time off and sit/ relax on the bench nearby. You can also take time off the busy life and unwind and see the city carry on even at 3 am in the night! I had a wonderful time unwinding with a friend and observing the city and activities bustling on was indeed soothing.
Prarthana D|6742F9B697D5D0BAC24348FFE2CF2302|Attractions|London: Tower Bridge|5| “Great View and history”|review_475726901|You can soak up amazing views at or near the Tower Bridge, which has given the city its character. If you are tired from all the walking or sight seeing in London (there are plenty and can it get any more hectic on a deadline? )- You can always chill at one of the cafe's or barista's located just nearby. Always busy day/ night, the tower bridge does not disappoint.

Prarthana D|6742F9B697D5D0BAC24348FFE2CF2302|Attractions|Edinburgh: Arthur's Seat|5| “The best 'seat' to see great views of Edinburgh and around”|review_444954646|I was first introduced to this place by my guests visiting me. We woke up early at 4 am in order to catch the sunrise! It was a strenous climb as we started climbing from the sainsbury craigs, but we made it to the top by late 5ish am and were thrilled to the see the site! It was gorgeous. You can see the whole of Edinburgh and beyond and the sunrise we saw is probably by far the best one. I think it is definitely worth the climb and early morning/ late evening hassle!
Prarthana D|6742F9B697D5D0BAC24348FFE2CF2302|Attractions|Dover: White Cliffs of Dover|5| “Absolutely breathtaking”|review_444951715|It was everything that I had dreamt of and more! On a clear sunny day, you can possibly see France as it is just 23 miles off (Don't be disheartened if you cannot see French coastline, you will definitely get roaming service claiming, "Welcome to France"! If that does not cheer you up, it will atleast make you supremely cautious with making calls!) It is a good long walk with varied amounts of accents and descents, so you might want to be dressed appropriately. There are 3 or more trails that you can take up. I followed the one that took you to the lighthouse at the last corner of the cliffs. The walk was so refreshing and breathtaking that it left me wishing for more at the end. There iis a cafe in the beginning of the trail, where you can stock up on your caffeine!
Prarthana D|6742F9B697D5D0BAC24348FFE2CF2302|Attractions|Dover: Dover Castle|5| “Brililant. Dont miss it!”|review_444950653|Visiting castles have been of great interest to me as they are the relics of passage of an era! While staying in Kent for a few months for an internship, I was highly motivated to visit as many castles and get to know the local history. One of the castles that made it to the list was Dover castle. Making a day trip was probably very ambitious of us but we did manage to spend good enough time at the castle. Keep a look out for 2 in 1 ticket offers online (As a group of students, it was highly welcome). The castle as well as castlegrounds are massive and I would recommend you to spend the whole day at the castlegrounds. There are many activities happening around, which will keep you occupied for instance the WW2 tours, castle tours, etc. The highlight of the trip was the decorations in the main hall and interactive skit performances throughout the day by highly talented staff who took care to depict the era in its entirety. In my opinion, the Dover castle spoilt me so much that now I rate other tours with par to this visit! However, we had a slight inconvenience with the fact that the Dover cliffs were not accessible via castle grounds due to road works and thus we had to climb down and climb back up all the way again. Apart from that, it was terrific.
Prarthana D|6742F9B697D5D0BAC24348FFE2CF2302|Attractions|Canterbury: Canterbury City Walls|5| “Great views!”|review_444948087|Located just opposite the railway station, it was one of the first places we crossed over to from the overhead bridge. Canterbury as a town has done a great deal to develop but keeping history as its integral part. This fusion can be seen at the Canterbury city walls. It is very well maintained and is a great place for walks and photos!

Prarthana D|6742F9B697D5D0BAC24348FFE2CF2302|Attractions|Canterbury: Canterbury Cathedral|4| “Breathtaking”|review_444943829|Canterbury was one of the places I always wanted to visit and it was worth it! You can catch a Southeast train service to Dover Priory from London Victoria (one of the ways to go about from many!) or even drive through the amazing county of Kent. Canterbury is a wee bustling neat town and the walk to the castle takes just about 15 mins from the train station. Add a little bit of sun to your day and some cold beer to make your trip absolutely cheerful! The cathedral is just majestic and can be seen magnificently over the horizon from any part of the town. It offers some great historical stories and still plays an important role in Westminster. The grandeur of the building itself is imposing and you can easily spend the whole day.
Prarthana D|6742F9B697D5D0BAC24348FFE2CF2302|Attractions|Ballygrant: Finlaggan|5| “A delightful walk through the history of the Isles”|review_443149089|While I walked along the ruins of Finlaggan, I could not help but feel pensive. Wondering about how the grandeur turned into ruins that still stand tall and obvious today along the landscape. It is a quite walk with brilliant natural views. The historical site is as untouched as possible and there are planks that provide information on the landmarks. The islands are connected via a wooden bridge which makes it a very comfortable walk. The only words I can use briefly for this place would be : Breathtaking and Natural. There is a wee museum store located in the beginning that helps you get to know about the history. Unfortunately I was too late and it was closed by the time I arrived on site. I think it closes after 4 pm, so you might want to make a visit before then.

I have recently completed with my masters and wanted to just get out of reality and relax for a while in a quiet and quaint place and the Islay hotel does the trick. Since I was visiting on an off-peak time, the hotel concierge was more than happy to bump me to an upgraded suite even without asking! The hotel facilities are top notch and the food quantity as well as quality exceptional. The bar listings are very wide and the staff is always happy to assist you, especially if you want to have be pampered and have a comfy time in!! The best bit is that the location of the hotel is just 1 minute from the port and so it is easy for you to hop on/ off the ferry to the mainland.

The last bit included the whisky tastings and it was fab. The staff in general are experienced and very warm.

Since I made a visit in an off peak season, frequencies of public transport weren't that great, but Ian was a sport and was kind enough to give me a lift to the Kilchomen beach and then the Bruichladdich distillery. The hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and a fun bunch, who made my travel all the more interesting. Since I was traveling on my own, I was afraid of feeling lonely but these folks just made sure that I had a great Saturday night at the pub with Ian's delicious dinner! I greatly value cultural exchange and stories along my travels. Thus, having made the most amazing conversations with Ian and his staff was a cherry on top! I am going to be back to this amazing place and next time I might just stay for longer

They made me feel at home and even provided detailed information to visit nearby attractions including a map. Since I was keen to visit the Finlaggen ruins, and it was almost getting dark, Donald was kind enough to give me a lift one way to the historical site and also made sure that I had a torch light with me on my way back. We had a great Indian dinner with Donald and Rosemary always ready to entertain with the stories on the farm and beyond. Even though I was staying over for just a night, I was touched by the hospitality of the Fletchers. I would highly recommend anyone wishing to have a terrific islander experience to go have a stay at the Persabus farm! It is located a wee walk from the Port Askaig and located a few minutes’ walk from the Finlaggen ruins as well. Rosemary also runs a pottery craft workshop with fabulous art works too. Moreover, if you are just looking for a good humored stay, you won't be disappointed either.

However, the staff really let us down and ruined what would have been a wonderful day.Upon entering, staff approached us to inform us about an Easter promotion where to win, guests had to look out for staff wearing a special badge. We found one of those staff who congratulated us on being the first to win a chocolate hamper and to post a photo on Facebook in order to collect the prize. After doing that, we went to collect the prize but the staff there told us there was no chocolate at all and just a key ring. This was disappointing but not a big deal. The real problem was how we were treated - the staff laughed at us as if we were stupid for even asking about chocolate. So we went back to the staff at the entrance who originally told us about the promotion to ask for clarification on the prizes, and their answers went from "I don't know" to "there is supposed to be chocolate" - they couldn't give a simple yes or no answer. So then we then went to Guest Services to complain about how unclear this promotion was. We were served by Miki, who when we explained what had happened, she openly laughed as us to our faces. It was only after we said we were insulted by her laughing at us that she made up some excuse saying the promotion was somehow funny and that she wasn't laughing at us. She also had no idea about this promotion and admitted it was the park's problem for not properly briefing staff. Although disappointing not to win anything, the issue we had was with the staff. They had a really bad attitude- laughing at guests, not offering any kind of problem resolution or even a simple apology for how we were treated. Miki then confirmed that all we could do was fill in a complaint form and that the park nor the Genting group would do anything. It really gave us the impression that they just don't care about their guests.I would still recommend visiting Universal Studios as it is a fun day out but I would strongly advise not to bother speaking to staff about any kind of promotion as they have no clue as to what's going on, and rather than trying to help, they just laugh at you. It would be great if management at Universal Studios could provide training for staff on how to properly handle complaints rather than treating their guests like idiots.

As we went at night, we couldn't actually see anything so I can't comment on the area itself. But, it was worth the drive and price. It is a little expensive but they are very generous with their scoop size and there are so many flavors to choose from, there is surely something for everyone!

It is a lovely little restaurant with nice and quirky decor. The staff were friendly and they were quick in serving us our drinks and food. There is a great choice on the menu so you are not just limited to pizzas, but would highly recommend their pizzas - we ordered two and they were both very, very tasty! Luzzo's is a lovely little place - perfect for friends, couples or even just to dine alone. I would highly recommend this place, the price is reasonable and it is definitely worth every cent!

The room we stayed in was beautifully decorated and the bed was very comfortable. The owners were very nice and friendly and really made us feel welcome. They gave us great recommendations on where to go nearby and provided us with a scrumptious breakfast that would have been fit for a King! We were so well looked after that we were even given cookies to take on the road with us - their kind hospitality really made this stay a memorable one!

The staff were all very friendly and helpful, especially with giving us recommendations on what to order since it was our first visit. The service was quick and the food was really good and made the overall feeling a very positive one.
FMSHK|2E832CCD2A19873E8AC6D64806BC83EE|Hotel|New York City: Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, New York City|2| “Looks nice on the outside but dissapointing on the inside!”|review_118851492|The positives are that the hotel is conveniently located and the bell and concierge staff were nice and friendly. Unfortunately, everything else let the hotel down. The front desk staff were arrogant and unhelpful, especially when I asked for help with the noisy air-conditioning. They look unimpressed and as it turns out, it's a complaint they get often. When a staff member came to check the noisy air-con, we were told to either put up with the noise or switch off the air-con completely and wake up to switch it back on when it gets too hot - it would have been nice if he had taken the initiative to check if another less noisy room was available rather than telling us to do so ourselves. However, he did say most of their rooms have the same problem and since the doors on each floor are so close to each other, you can feel the bed fame shake each time someone enters/leaves their room so don't stay here if you're looking for somewhere for a peaceful nights sleep. The breakfast was dry and unappetizing and a seemed a few days old and the pastries looked as if someone sat on them - if breakfast is an important meal for you, then be prepared to go somewhere else for it! Although the hotel is relatively new, there was already a large crack in the bathroom sink and as there is no ventilation in the bathroom, be prepared to wait or clean the mirror after the shower if you want to use it. This doesn't seem like a hotel that cares about service as even upon check out, we didn't get a smile nor were we asked if we enjoyed our stay. For the price that they charge, you can get better elsewhere.

As we would have used this mode of transport a lot more. We tried to upgrade and they wouldn't let us. Was disappointing. The ride is great and definitely worth a go. Great views of Singapore

I seriously regret staying here for 6 nights. TripAdvisor normally doesn't let me down. But it did here. We stayed in a panoramic ocean room. The room was small and cramped. The door to the bathroom has panels. So unfortunately u can hear everything that goes on in there. The shower had no pressure, so was very hard to wash hair. The hotel felt old. Even though it's only about 7 years old. The breakfast was not good. Super busy. Took about 15min everyday to get a seat... we tried coming at different times throughout the morning, it didn't help. Food was crazy expensive. A glass of wine is $20 and a beer $11. We ended up going to the shops and getting snacks and drinks from there. The resort was only for families. A waist of time for couples. You feel like just one of the masses. We had just come from phu Quoc island in Vietnam and it was amazing. The service was out of this world. So it was tough to come to this straight after. A very different holiday.Don't stay here if u r looking for a relaxing holiday for you and your partner. This resort is ONLY FOR FAMILIES

I have been to some great places. But this is phenomenal. The standout is the breakfast! Best I have ever had. Love the champagne with it as well. The staff were fantastic. Always trying to help make your stay amazing. Again I have been to great resorts all over asia. But the staff here were the best I have ever had. We stayed on the 3rd floor. A nice room with a view. Not the biggest rooms. But were very nice. The food at the pool bar was great! The only thing I would ask would be to have more of a range on the menu, or have a few specials each day, we for a bit bored of the menu by our 6th day. The different places to eat are great. Once u r here at the resort u don't really need to leave. There isn't anywhere else on the island to eat. I went to one other restaurant. (Rated 2nd in places to eat) it was crap in comparison to the resort. Once u r here u won't really leave. Gym was good. New, clean, plenty of equipment for what u need.We went up to vinpearl for a day which was fun. Literally no one there... a little freaky. But a fun day out. Overall I wouldn't stay anywhere else. This is definitely the best place in Phu Quoc Thanks for a great stay!!! We will be back

And then cocktails/drinks and canapés after that. We loved it, very classy, again the staff new us personally. They were very helpful, organising dinners and bookings for us. The breakfast was great. We had just come front the shangrila in Sentosa which in comparison was terrible. The resort is massive, so never felt busy even though it was school holidays in Aus. There are 5 resort pools for whatever you are looking for. Our favourite was the infinity pool, where u can see the ocean and the surfers doing their thing. We are already planning our next trip back. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Bali. It is the perfect location to everything. And is just the best resort on the island!

The accommodation is the best you'll get in Vietnam, I love the private beach, we had a beach front room, it was beautiful waking up to the waves in the morning, and I loved the outdoor showers. The restaurant was good and efficient, expensive in comparison to Vietnamese foods at a normal restaurant. Generally around $800 000 for 2 people, but to be in the tranquility of this place was well worth it. (No more bike horns)We have already booked to come back next year, just have to make sure we save up because the activities are expensive, we didn't go on any day trips as they were all a minimum of about $2.5million pp and at the end of a months holiday it was too much. Thanks again Amiana for making our honeymoon so special. Can't wait to see you next year!

Also the adjoining bars and eateries cause a lot of chaos in the area. BTW first timers in Bangkok can always walk down the market area to get a first hand feel of Thailand.

Sierra T|B7236B049E641FCE44410E16CF7FF31D|Hotel|Singapore: Somerset Liang Court Singapore|4| “Very enjoyable stay at Somerset Liang Court!”|review_500588166|Our stay at Somerset Liang Court was one to remember. We were very happy with the service and the quality of the rooms. We would recommend these apartments to anyone, especially families! Rooms:We had a 2 bedroom premier apartment. The rooms were quite spacious with 2 king beds. Originally in the second room there was 2 twin beds, which we asked to get pushed together after a few nights there. We also asked to get the mattress topper put on as the beds are REALLY firm. This went without any trouble by the staff and the bed was super comfy! We asked for a view of Marina Bay Sands and it was amazing! Breakfast:Breakfast wasn't great. In saying this, there was your normal spread of basic breakfast items available. Toast, fruit, tea/coffee, juice, bread rolls, salad, eggs and 4 other dishes. So even though it was nothing special, it was some sustainable food to start your day. Staff:Very friendly and welcoming. Every time we walked in and out of the apartments, they always greeted us with a warm smile. House keeping did a great job everyday. Location:The location was pretty central in terms of being close to the MRT station (Clarke Quay - 10mins walk). I did notice they are building a new one across the road, but not sure when that will open. Clarke Quay is situated about a 4 minute walk from the apartments and is basically all western restaurants. Night life there is pretty big and wild, so prepare for a loud night! Pool:Towels are available free of charge down at the pool. There is a deep and shallow end, handy for the kids. Big enough to do laps in. Lots of seating around the pool with bathrooms located next to it. It is shared with the Novotel, but never seemed that busy. Shops:Liang court is located right next the apartments which is really convenient! It is pretty much a shopping centre. They have a wide variety of food ranging from traditional to western. There is also a 'MEIDI-YA' (grocery store) but beware of the prices! Transport:After reading reviews that we had to be dropped off at the Novotel (just around the corner), we did this for a few days. One day we asked for reception to get us a taxi and it arrived at the front of the apartments. The reason why people go to the Novotel is because the Somerset doesn't actually have a taxi stop area, it's just on the road. So if you have kids or lots of bags, it's not safe just to have your driver stop on the road. Thanks guys!!
Sierra T|B7236B049E641FCE44410E16CF7FF31D|Hotel|Singapore: Marina Bay Sands|5| “Wow, wow, wow! ”|review_477072818|This hotel is insane! The shear size of the hotel itself is mind blowing and it did not disappoint. We stayed in a Premier Skyview room with an extra bed. First off, the staff at checkin were very helpful as we asked for a slightly earlier checkin to attend a function. They offered us a room that was ready but it was 20 floors lower than our original so we didn't take it. However our room was ready 1:30pm (normally checkin at 3pm) so this was very kind. The staff brought the bags to the room as soon as we got in there. The room was huge! Way bigger than the pictures online showed it to be! Even with an extra bed, is was easy to move around with all our luggage on the floor. The views were unreal day and night! Bathroom was massive and the bath was big enough to lie comfortably in. We asked to get a bucket of ice, which was no problem at all and had it in 10 minutes. The pool lived up to its fame undoubtedly! Make sure everyone has their pass as they need it to enter the the sky deck (level 57). Turns out 7am is slightly busy! We got up this early to watch the sunrise, try catch it if you can! Checkout was a breeze and would definitely recommend this hotel to someone looking for a little bit of luxury!

Useful information is provided throughout the aquarium about what you are seeing and interesting facts.

The buffet was mainly Asian (dumplings, gyozas, dumplings, etc.) with some fruit, scones and other little samples. The staff were extremely friendly, courteous and respectful. I don't think that the price really justified what we got, but it's the experience and we certainly enjoyed it. Raffles is under new management and in July it will be closing down for 2 years to undergo renovations. Pretty sad as it doesn't look like it needs renovations at all!

It is unbelievable standing underneath the trees and seeing it from different angles. There is a light show every night at 7:45pm and 8:45pm. DO. NOT. MISS. IT. It seriously has to be seen to be believed! The light show is set to some music which adds an extra element to the overall experience. We didn't do the skywalk as we had run out of time. I don't think it is really necessary as getting that close to the trees isn't that amazing. Although I can't say much as I did not go up there. The queue for the skywalk during the light show was soooo long. I believe that being on the ground is good as you get to see all the trees top to bottom. Overall insane experience I'll remember for a long time!

It is 10 minutes I'll never get back of my life. The lady at the front desk didn't even look up at us until we said hi and then didn't even saying anything back. Quite rude. We asked if the movies were in English and she said yes. What she thought was if we were asking her if she spoke English. This meant that the whole introduction explaining what to do was in Chinese. I know zero Chinese words so that was annoying. Pretty boring as you just were shooting the screen the whole time. Didn't feel it was 7D either, only 4D or 5D. Overall not a good experience. Would not recommend or do this again.

Certainly glad we did! It was very interesting seeing all the different animals at night time, going about there business. It was good sitting on an open bus which had an audio tour, given you don't know what each animal is. The audio talks about the animals and their habitat which was interesting as I learnt a lot! The bus has no lights on it and the park only had lights on in the animals areas. This made it feel really cool! It was surprising how they just left the animals without any fences just stand there, being so calm. BRING BUG SPRAY! We all got bitten my mozzies! Good fun for the family!

It was kind of annoying as there were people who stood up the whole time against the windows just taking pictures. I'm sure they weren't aware other people wanted to, I don't know... SEE! That was a slight disappointment but nothing to do with the flyer itself. The windows could have used a clean as there were dirty fingerprints visible which made the photos not as clear. The flight is for 30 minutes, which quickly so don't waste the opportunity and time you have up there!

Considering 'once is never enough', we purchased the 3 ride pass. The experience didn't start off great in the sense that the guy working there was angry and didn't anything to do with us, whilst giving us instructions on how to us the luge. While waiting in line for the next ride, 2 of the staff began to fight, with another one stepping in the break it up. Really awkward. The luge itself was really fun but with it being so short, you couldn't really reach a thrilling speed. With the constant turning around the corners, this also made it hard to gain speed. There are 2 courses to take so definitely get the 3 ride pass. This also comes with the 3 chair lift passes so once you get off the luge you get back to the top again. Really good views! Overall staff were unfriendly and uninterested. The luge was fun but just too short.

Lots of things for kids aged around 6-12. We came to the park on a Thursday and it was pretty busy. The rides are fun, but they weren't 'scary', although I am an adrenaline seeker. The Bluwater Bay (wave pool) was packed and made it uncomfortable as you were bumping into each other when the waves came. The best ride was the Riptide Rocket. We had to wait 45 minutes for this because we knew it was not going to get much shorter. The ride definitely takes you by surprise! Rainbow Reef was the highlight as you saw soooo many different fishes! Would recommend this, although we had to wait about 50 minutes. The Adventure River is a lazy river and will take you through a mini arched aquarium which was cool. Food quite pricey and not that great. Got a sprite out of the machine but was just soda water? Hired a big locker all day for $20. Happy we went.
Sierra T|B7236B049E641FCE44410E16CF7FF31D|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|4| “Great atmosphere, great day! ”|review_475558191|After our recent visit to Universal Studios Singapore on Tuesday, we would highly recommend getting the express pass. Watching the express people walk right past you while you have been waiting in the line for 45 minutes, really isn't fun. Whether it be weekend or weekday, your experience will be much better if you have the express pass. In saying this, the longest we had to go on the Transformers ride which was about an hour which isn't too long in the scheme of things. Definitely recommend the Cylon and Revenge of the Mummy. Lockers are free for 45 minutes and then you pay $2 for every 20 minutes. So sucks if you have waited in a line and you get charged. Therefore you should carry some money on you just in case it was to happen. Food is a little pricey, western and traditional options available. Overall really fun day, would do it again!

The kitchen facilities were excellent with many utensils and crockery. There is a lot of storage space for food, including the massive fridge / freezer. Views were incredible! Morning or night, they can not get any better in Broadbeach. The hotels facilities such as the pool, spa, sauna and gym were all extremely well maintained and were not uncomfortably crowded (Nov 2016). Check-in was a breeze with friendly staff who will often start a chat in the elevators. A few things that could be improved or looked at was the bin location in the apartment. The bin would not fully open under the sink and the foot pedal was broken. The bathroom cupboards were also quite dusty but these things did not affect our stay. Overall it was an experience we will not forget and were recommended these apartments.

The butter chicken was nice but I have had better. We also had the coconut chilli lamb which has the perfect heat to it. The meat was soooo tender in both dishes which meant they just melt in your mouth. The waiters were so friendly and were happy to explain the dishes to us. It was a bit noisy but the restaurant was pretty packed. Considering how many tables were there we thought we got our food quite quickly. Overall we really enjoyed our dinner at Flavours of India and will be happy to return soon.

We order the 'special banquet' and it was great! The meat was very tender and the flavours worked well together. A little tip is not to fill up on dip and bread at the start as it leaves you with little room for mains! The waiters were friendly and attentive. With the new renovations, it has certainly improved the feel of the restaurant. It was a little pricey but overall it was a lovely night.

The waiters are very friendly and nice but they are a bit hard to catch. As we were a group of four we ordered 2 vegetarian platters for entree. The vegetarian platters were very nice and good to try a range of different things although it wasn't good value for money. We ordered Butter Chicken ($19.90) Beef Korma ($18.50) and Lamb Karahi ($18.90) for mains. For the amount of food that we recieved, I thought it was quite over priced. The food itself was amazing and all the meat was tender. *IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW* As a group of 4, we thought 4 serves of rice and 4 serves of naan would be enough. The servings are HUGE. We could have gone with 2 serves of rice and 2 serves of naan. There was a lot of people there and even though it was hard to hear people at times, it wasn't that bad. Also, I would recommend BYO as the prices for the alcohol is quite expensive. Overall it was a really nice night and would go back again soon.

Our first problem was that the entrée we wanted to order wasn't available. The staff were very friendly but not always around so it took a while to get their attention. The food took a VERY long time to come out which was a disappointment considering there were only a few other tables there. When the food came out, it looked very appetising with decent serving sizes. Not sure whether it was my taste, but there wasn't much flavour in all 3 of our dishes. They also all kind of tasted the same. Overall a nice night but could be better.

There is so much to see you when you look over Canberra, you could stay there till sunset and take more photos of that! Inside, there are many functions that are held there so it's a huge area where you can go sit down and have a coffee. They have a bonsi area where you can go visit which is really nice. There is also a massive play area for the kids to play in.

The bikes were in excellent condition and the helmets were too. They also have drink holders on the bikes too which is good on a hot day. Prices fairly good considering the quality of the bikes. They also have huge quad bikes for a family with little kids. Would come here again as it was much fun.

It has a range of different holes which are all fun and sometimes very frustrating! The prices are going up and are quite expensive but it's a fun day so we don't mind. They also have some snacks availabe there is you want some after

We are constantly served the freshest food which tastes amazing! The pasta isn't the best but it is still nice. The service is quite good but sometimes the waitresses forget something we have asked for. Aside from those minor things sam's is a great family dinner spot where you can sit outside and watch the world go by on the promenade.

We are always served with polite waiters who always have a smile on their face. We went there for my mums birthday and had such a great night with an awesome sunset. They were ale to arrange a bomb Alaska for her cake which was really nice. The food is of good quality but there is not much of a range. They have a few entrees, mains and desserts but it would be good for them to change it up occasionally. The service is also a little bit slow but considering the number of people who were there I don't blame them. Overall we always have a great night at On The Pier.

The rooms were clearly in need of an update as they were quite outdated and dusty. The beds were not overly comfortable and the bathroom was quite small. We also had a moth flying around our room which was not pleasant. The outdoor area was very nice though and they had a pool which I did not swim in, but many other people did. I would not recommend this hotel to people as I did not enjoy my stay.

We had a fantastic time at Yejele beach and would go back again in a heartbeat. Despite all the bluebottles and stepping on one and getting stung, the snorkelling was unreal and nothing like I have experienced! There are many people selling coconuts and beers on the beach so you will never go thirsty. They accept AUD so don't worry if you don't have any Franc currency. There was an obvious storm starting to roll in and just as we thought it might hit, it did. It rained for about 3 minutes and cleared up perfectly after that! So if there's a storm rolling in, don't worry about it! I would highly recommend this beach which is in a cruise itinerary as you will always leave with a smile on your face.

As soon as you get off the bus or the car, you are greeted by friendly locals who provide some info about hair braiding, horse riding, drinks and more. The palm trees set a lovely scene as well. Maybe 3 hotels are located on the beach front so if you wanted to wake up to that spectacular scene, then Natadola beach is the way to go. We went there for snorkelling and were a bit disappointed with it. There is not many fish that we saw, but the ones we did see were very pretty. Lots of coral on the sea bed as well!

We had never flown Malaysia airlines before but it was a good experience. We had middle seats which very pretty cramped but they are a reasonable about of leg room space. The food was really good for plane food on some flights (we had 4 flights all together) and other flights, we didn't want to eat it. Overall we had pleasant flights on Malaysia Airlines and would be happy to fly with them again.

They offer a variety of packages for the kids, family and couples. There fish is always so delicate and tender, no bones! They also have amazing calamari and scollaps. Everymeal also comes with lemon. Once you have ordered your meal, you can go sit on the deck and watch the water and seagulls fly around. They cook your meal very fast so it's not a long wait. Innes' Boatshed also do daily river cruises up to Nelligan. Daily meaning if they have enough people. It is about a 2-3 hour trip, with the stopover at Nelligan where you can explore for about half an hour. You can order lunch and they will serve it to you on the boat. The staff are very friendly and willing to help in any wat they can. There is some space avaliable at the front of the boat if you want to sit out there or alternitivley, you can sit on the top of the boat. They have a mini bar/snack area where you can buy a few drinks or some chips. Innes' Boatshed is great for families who are coming down to the bay and want to have a nice fish and chip lunch by the water!

They are very fast with service and the waiters are nice and accomodating. We love sitting outside in the summer season as you can be by the water and enjoy your dinner as the sun goes down. They have a wide range of pizzas and pastas to seafood and steaks. My personal favourite at the Starfish Deli is the Thai Chicken pizza, mouth watering! I once had the salt and pepper calamari and that was a bit flavourless but the calamari itself was very tender. Once you have finished your dinner you can go to the cabnit where they have slices and cakes avaliable. They also have a few desserts on the menu, one of which is the chocolate banana spring rolls. It. was. amazing. You get 2 deep fried springrolls with a nice raspberry sauce which just makes the meal perfect. We will be customers at the Starfish Deli for years to come! Thank you!

Our food was very gourmet and was delicious aswell. We got there 2 hours after they opened and they had already sold out of the special - Beef cheeks and T-bone steak. The restraunt is very little though and quite cramp which makes it quite noisy but that didn't ruin our experience. They served us very fast considering all the tables inside and outisde were full. Dessert was very nice (even though we didn't need it) but it was a nice way to top off the evening. This restaurant is only open for dinner, so book early as seats may be taken fast in the high season! Overall it was a fabulous night at the Little Restaurant and Bar.

Because our flight arrived before we could check in, they kindly let us put our bags in their storage area. When we got into our room we were amazed at how big the apartment was! There was a big bathroom which was plenty of room for 4 girls, the rooms were spacious and had great views and the lounge/dinning area was very big! It was great and fitted our needs perfectly. There was just a piece of glass outlooking to etihad stadium and the docklands which was breathtaking! I got a little dizzy looking down at the bottom considering we were on a realllllllllly high floor. I also got a little scared the glass was going to break looking down haha but i knew it wouldn't! The deck was also nice to sit on too, to out and have a drink. The gym was fully eqipped with lots of new equipment and the pool area was nice. The pool was quite cold though. There is also no sun beds around the pool so you just have to sit on your towels. There is very little in the way of restraunts and cafes around the area but the is an IGA outside the hotel. As we were travelling to the Convention Centre everyday, we needed to catch trams to the Centre. This was not ideal as we had to catch a few before we actually got there. Great location for the Etihad stadium for exapmle but not so much for the Convention Centre. But in terms of the hotel itself, it provided everything we needed and more so thank you for a lovely stay!

We stayed here for the location of the Gold Coast Convention Centre. This was about a 7 minute walk across the bridge. The apartment was very clean and had a very homely feel to it. The kitchen was equipped with all appliances and the washing detergent was provided if you wanted to use the dishwasher. The main bedroom had great views and had a big ensuite. The beds were comfortable and warm. We couldn't get the foxtel in our room to work, but we not too bothered about that. The service at the front desk was very friendly and welcoming to all guests. The was a little cafe around the corner of reception which we didnt go to, but looked like it had a range of breakfast and snack items. The pool area was very beautiful with lots of trees and tables to sit at around the pool area. There was also a few BBQ's around the area. The pool was a nice temperature and the spa was very luxurious. There was also amazing views down the bottom of the pool. To sum it all up, we had a very nice stay at The Freshwater Point Resort and was very happy with stay. Thank you!

The Calimari itself was very tender and soft but the batter didn't take like salt and pepper. I also had it with a mango 'green' drink. This had alot of mint in it but it was very nice. The staff were was nice and friendly. Our table also had Moreton Bay Bugs which from what i had a taste of were melt in your mouth delicious! It was a nice atmosphere and our food came very quickly. We had a very nice dinner at the Sage restraunt and it was a good experience. Thank you!

The staff were very friendly when we first got there. We travelled there for 4 nights and 5 days to attend a competition happening at the Gold Coast Convention Centre. It was in about a 6 minute walking distance and a very nice walk to the convention centre aswell! We were on the one of the highest floors and it provided breathtaking views! There was a very wide and spacious deck which was nice to sit on with a drink. You could see all of Surfers paradise beach far out into the city. If you wanted to actually walk along the beach, it was about a 4 minute walk. Our 2 bedroom apartment and was HUUUUUUUGE and the size of a house! There were 2 living room areas and the rooms were very big. The main bedroom had a double basin ensuite and a very nice spa bath. There is only a piece of clear glass which seperates the room from the bathroom. Not good for privacy but you can see the ocean from the bathroom atleast! The other bathroom was wasnt as big but still nice. Kitchen was also quite big with lots of appliances. The pool is in a very unique shape and i saw it be cleaned every morning. There was a spa inside and outside, but they were both very nice and relaxing. There are also a grassy area with family tables to have a lunch or something. Tennis courts are also located around the side of the hotel. There is a bus stop across and down the road a little bit which provides stops at many loactions including all the theme parks, shopping centres, beaches and much more. It is about a 5 minute walk to restraunts and the shops which is very convenient. There is starbucks, coldrock, 711, sage restraunt, new york style pizza shops and loads more! So i think that this is a perfert hotel for convinece to the convention centre, the beach, shops and so much more! I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to say in Broadbeach! Thank you!

We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment. The rooms were spacious and the beds were very comfortable. The main bedroom had a very big bathroom that was excellent as we were travelling with 2 teenage girls! The pool, sauna and spa were very warm and luxurious. The gym was fully equipped with lots of new equipment. The kitchen was well fitted with appliances and it was quite large as well. The outlook was nice as the hotel is in a kind of circle shape. There is a pizza place a few metres from the entrance of the doors which is AMAZING! We kept on going back to order more pizza. I would defininetly recommend the Peri Peri Pizza. Overall we had a great stay at the Meriton in Parramatta and the staff were very friendly! I would recommed this hotel to everyone!

Every morning buffet breakfast is open from 6:30am - 11:00am. The breakfast has an amazing range of different foods. Without having this brekfast service each morning, we would have stuggled to get breakfast each morning. It's also great if you have an early tour and you need to eat breakfast early. Happy hour is from 5:00pm - 7:00pm. Between 5:00pm - 7:00pm, you can get buy 1 get 1 free drink. This inculdes all drinks (e.g. if you get 1 cocktail and 1 beer, you will get 2 cocktails and 2 beers. We got this wrong) The wine is quite expensive and all the other drinks are a little pricey but really good. Everyday room serice gave us 6 new bottles of water so you dont need to get water from the supermarket. The hotel has some chips, ice cream, souvenirs, few drinks and a few other snacks but the best place to go, is the shops about 10 metres from the front enterence of the hotel. They have everything you need + clothes and your other essential items. There are a few restraunts around the streets near the hotel but the best restraunts are on the beach to be honest! There are many beauty shops around the streets as well. The pool area is amazing with a fun slide for the kids and water activities daily. They also have balls you can play with around the pool too. There are pool towels. The pool hours are 8:00am - 8:00pm but alot people don't get out of the pool at 8:00pm, but i think that's mainly for the little kids, as you only see adults in at that time. The room that we were in was the furtherest away apartment there could be but that didn't bother us too much as it was a nice walk past the pool. At night time is was a quiet but the beds were really firm. The gym is well equiped with a variety of exercise machines and a ping pong table. Kids club was really a place for little kids to go and have some time to play with a range of activities. The wifi was good for some people and a little bit dodgy for others. All the wifi is free and it does work it sometimes just takes a little time to connect. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. They were able to book all our tours, taxis and requests that we had. Almost every single staff memeber we walked past would give us a smile. So all up we had a great time staying at the Swissotel in Kamala Beach, Phuket!

He confirmed the booking by email so we didn't have anything to worry about.He was there waiting patiently for us when we finally arrived after at least half hour delay waiting for luggage to arrive - and he had some lovely cold bottles of water for us too! Nikos had all kinds of good advice on places to visit etc. Same for our return trip, he was right on time & got us to the airport no problems. To pay about the same (or not much more) than a regular taxi, and get this kind of personal & reliable service, is just fantastic - highly recommend ATS :)

It's big so you can choose to rent a sunbed & umbrella for the day (going rate 5 euros for 2 beds for the day) in one of several "organised" areas or, if you prefer more privacy, find a quiet sandy spot away from the crowd (in which case bring your own umbrella for some shade) . There are lots of tavernas & cafes - 3 brothers is fantastic - and even a water sports place - yet the beach remains quiet & peaceful, much more relaxed than the busier beaches closer to town. Dress protocol is flexible, topless seems to be fine anywhere, you can also go nude if you want although probably not on the organised sections with rented sunbeds.Water is calm, not as shallow as some other beaches (Agiassos, Pyrgaki) but still good for kids.

The place itself is amazing, rides (especially roller coasters) are great. Thanks to our pass we were able to get straight on to most things, maybe 5 minutes wait at most, as many times as we liked - whereas the regular queues for most rides were between 30 mins to an hour. We'd go on the same ride 3 or 4 times in less time than we'd have had to stand in line to go on once. Can't recommend that pass enough!!

Grown ups went for more traditional lunch food: BBQ chicken salad was very tasty, lambs fry & bacon was excellent.Coffee was very good.The cakes in the display fridge looked out of this world - I think a High Tea here would be very good (I intend to find out soon!)Decor is relaxed and fun - even if you're not into cats! - we loved the old/antique mismatched tableware, every table is different, there is so much to look at all around the place while you wait for your food. Service was prompt and efficient while still being friendly and fun.And to top it off they also sell a very cool selection of American & British confectionery & sodas, plus a pretty good looking selection of teas.This might be our new favourite place whether for a quick coffee & cake or a full lunch.Great for families but would also be great for grown ups to meet for relaxed coffee/lunch & chat.

We got there pretty early, the place quickly filled up, and we had a very long wait (about an hour) before the food arrived. Personally I found the menu somewhat fussy, needed some simple basic breakfast items. I ordered sausages with poached eggs - specifically asking for the eggs to have runny yolks. When it arrived : the sausage had a fairly strange taste (heavy on what was possibly tarragon?), but of the 2 eggs, one was lovely and runny, the other was inedible. The yolk was totally hard and dry, as if it had been hard boiled for half an hour. Surely if a chef can't get poached eggs right, what hope is there? A colleague ordered coffee & had to ask for it again 20 minutes later when it still hadn't arrived...generally got the impression the staff couldn't cope with a full restaurant.

If that wasn't enough, the food is fantastic and service is friendly. Breakfast/brunch is great (recommend the corn cakes), lunches also lovely (thai beef salad is very good, fish & chips VERY tasty...). For starters the goats cheese wontons are amazing. I have never ever had bad food here, it's always very yummy. For locals (like me) it's a great place to come for a lazy lunch/brekky/supper & remind yourself just how lucky we are to live in Paradise :)
Nicky B|426D5ECCB9166C11AF1B537D20FC2C44|Hotel|Magnetic Island: Island Leisure Resort|5| “Great value, fantastic family break”|review_233229910|Back for a second visit - with the kids this time. Lovely resort, very relaxed and family friendly, staff/owners are very friendly and helpful. Kids loved the games room (air hockey, pool table & ping pong table) and they also enjoyed the craft activities and the tennis court. The "library" is a lovely touch with a great selection of books perfect for pool-side reading! Also great to have kids board games available (all free of charge).Pool area is lovely (although would be nicer if the smoking area could be scrapped all together as smoke did drift across the whole pool area at times). BBQ area by the pool was also nice at night - suggestion for improvement would be to add some nice fairy lights or lamps for evening BBQs.Overall just a lovely relaxing place for families, close to shops & restaurants/cafes, hope to be back again some time !

The ferry leaves approx every 15 minutes during the day time. Do not forget to have your camera ready during the journey to capture some of the breathtaking views the river has to offer.

Better view in the night with all the buildings beautifully lit up and also the during the laser light show. The day time seemed to be bit foggy with blurred view of the other side across the harbour.

The check-in was done without any hassles and the room although not much spacious (the HK standard) was clean. One good thing is that the wifi is excellent and the hotel provides you with a free phone with free internet for any calls locally. Be careful not to lose/damage it as you got to return it once you leave the hotel. The location is ideal in the Mongkok area, but maybe bit hard to find the hotel if you are arriving from the airport. I had some problems finding the hotel initially. The staff at the reception guided me with some attractions nearby and also the bus routes. The cafe is good, the staff helpful and the breakfast tasty, although a little expensive. I took their airport shuttle service during my return back to the airport and it was convenient and reached airport on time. The in-room facilities are quite good, television is good, complimentary items are decent and adequate for a couple of night stay.

The bathroom doors. seriously? It is just made up of glass and we had to close the curtains and leave it to the mercy of vapour to even mist the view from the room to the bathroom. Breakfast was ok.

The rooms are spacious, but breakfast at the cafe is decent but somewhere I felt this hotel was idea because we were checking in as a large group. Half of the rooms here have windows towards the adjacent apartment complex which was not very delighting. Request for higher floors/views towards the main road for a better experience.

Before you reach the limestone caves, you got to do a 272 (?) steps climb to the top, which, trust me would suck out all your energy and leave you panting and puffing once you make it. Once there, you are witness to one of the most amazing pieces of natural rock formation and the temples inside. Beware of monkeys here they can mess with you.

The cabin attendants are always smiling and the meal service was great, covered three flights but once they just seemed to rush, missing out on handing some items coming with the meals.IFE was standard on the B777 but great on the 777-300. The flight magazine was a lot more informative and helped myself with a good reading during the return leg.The flight times was upto the mark and no delays whatsoever.

It was interesting to just walk by and observe the huge park and the tall flag which bears significance to the Malaysians. Nothing attractive as such to this place than the one I mentioned.

Springs to life during the night with amazing restaurants and shopping. Some parts of the area gets loaded with garbage especially after lots of tourists visiting, not so filthy but yes many say this is one of the little dirty places in Singapore.

River ferries and tourist boat operate up and down the river, from Sathorn pier which is close to BTS Saphan takshin, good way to get to Wat Pho or the Grand Palace.

The hotel is very big but amenities are not on par with other standard hotels in the area. Room service is good, with occasional misses of not refilling complimentary items or towels not being replaced on some odd days. Most tourists here are Indians or bangladeshi. Good secure hotel in a location which I would say not recommended for those looking for a quiet place to stay.

Lots of variety when it comes to food. Because we were part of a group and there were young kids (include me? haha) they decided to serve us extra juice and soft drinks as well. Everything about this place is positive, except they made us wait for arranging the tables before they asked us to help ourselves with the food. Not sure about the value though as we have no idea about the cost.

What better way to capture the beauty of KL than be here on the observatory deck. One thing the view here has as opposed to from Petronas towers observatory is, the skyline from here has Petronas Towers haha :D Ticketing was easy, lines moved fast. Only thing that put me off a bit was the hazy weather.

The rides are themed based on popular US movies like Transformers and is a good place for kids and middle aged people alike. There did not seem to be enough time to cover all the major attractions but better to just try the famous ones including battlestar galactica and not rush through. However, the food courts seemed very expensive even by SIngapore standard.

Believe me, it wasn't as bad. The room is spacious with a kitchenette and microwave which helped a lot. AC was really cool. Some minor issues included were the coffee maker not working properly, took ridiculously long wait to even warm it to a decent temp, and once had struggle to open my room due to issues with the smartkey. A long walk to other side of the road to reception( tower-3 is on opp side). Did not try their cafe. Most staff doesn't spk english.

Nothing related to chocolate, though. A good place to spend time with family and kids will definitely enjoy being here. Din't try the food tough, which seemed quite expensive. Best place to click pictures. The place opens at 4 in the evening and remains so till midnight. The only drawback is that not many taxi agree to ferry till here, being very far. Also hard to get a taxi on the way back to bangkok, unless the one is being 'engaged' or halted for ourselves. Overall, a decent place.

This time it was fixed but stopped working again a few days later, but given we were going home shortly after we chose not to mention it. Overall, it's a good budget hotel if you are only using your room for sleeping.

The stunts were fun, authentic, and the actors really made an effort to engage with the crowd. We weren't able to finish the show though cos they had to stop it midway but that was impressive to me. There was an oncoming storm and they didn't want to compromise the show's quality and employee safety. Definitely finishing the full show when I get the chance.

The personality of the brand, staff and owners were fresh, attentive and very welcoming. I've been there five times now and would happily go back there again if it means I can have another taste of their delicious Fried Ice Cream.

Queues are long so expect your day of waiting. It's very hot and queuing for rides not in air con bur the occasional switched on fan! Staff on rides are quick paced so be ready to have your arm snatched to be put in the correct position for rides. The highlight of the day was getting a caricature we got black and white one it took 10 minutes and was amazing credit to Hafiz he was amazing and did it amazing as we told him we got engaged it was fantastic I hope universal appreciate his talents. It's worth a visit it would be amazing if not been to Orlando 6 months prior still worth a visit Jurassic rapids amazing and cyclon were the best rides and the water stunt show. Although my boyfriend got drenched as one of the guys came and took eye to men with hats or bald heads. He took his hat and soaked in bucket and put back on Josh's head, luckily he took it as a joke and the hat was £35 and could've been ruined, put your phone away as they slash anything in blue and green seats we were sat in green splash zone and says may get wet well josh was drenched. Also if you can't be bothered waiting and not bothered sat with friends go as single riders waiting a fraction of time. Universal if you read this please praise Hafiz for his amazing effort and talent.

Lovely power shower and amazing air con that could be kept on all day. The bed was massive which was great. The maids were amazing cleaned everyday with 2 complimentary bottles of water each day. Breakfast was limited but okay. Free wifi but wasn't great but good enough. The reception was good with booking excursions and did not rip you off. We stayed on the 3rd floor there is a lift after the 1st floor but there was no air so chose to walk but was dead after getting up them. The games room had table tennis and pool table which was great with air con and a gym. There was 3 pools with the little one being outside our room we went there, chlorine was high and took colour out of our swimwear and turned my white costume yellow. We only saw the pool get cleaned once a week it was quite mucky. Overall good room and pleasant staff. With complimentary sewing kit, tooth brush & tooth paste, razor, soap, shampoo and conditioner.

We came from karon very long sickly drive, so if you suffer from travel sickness take sickness pills. First stop was monkey cave was brilliant and fun. James Bond island was fun the journey was on a long boat over the mucky waters we then stopped off at the floating Muslim village that was good. Dinner ok take food if you don't like rice prawns or chicken drumsticks. Finally we got to the actual James Bond destination... Overly crowded but looked stunning. The water isn't clear but that doesn't it stop it looking good. The only thing that ruined this trip big time was the RUDE THAI WOMEN that worked on the stalls and were unbelievably rude and muttered stuff under their breath in thai. Also thai woman from stall offered to take picture of us and she then made me buy something do not take up on their offer there's always catch and they make you feel guilty! There was also boat rides who ask for tips make sure you take small change or else! We paid 2000 baht I would not pay a single penny more! But worth a visit and the culture.

There's loads to do so get there early also you have to get your ticket so if you're last you'll be at the back. We then went to the theatre what a joke you have to hand your mobiles and cameras in and get a token so the queue was 20 mins long and to get it back was 30 mins long. There's parents that let their children run riot it's a nightmare, rude people who ruin your photos without caring. Before entering Kingdom you have opportunities to ride elephants and feed them it was only 60 baht to feed and extortionate 900 to ride. You also have chance to pay to feed the baby tiger cubs that didn't look healthy their fur was dull and so were their eyes. The show was not what we expected very boring amateur dancing and cruel loud bangs of fireworks where you saw the elephants become very distressed very upsetting. The elephants did amazing tricks but just looks so unnatural to see elephants do this mixed feeling. All in all not worth £109 for two people gold seats including transfers.

But no air con? Whilst there I also heard that it had been shut down due to 2 people dying in 24 hours. They reinforced barriers much safer now as it is a sky scraper.

Great shows great value. Aqualand - rubbish water park but 100% the best dolphin show I have ever seen it is so worth the trip!!Monkey world - yet again amazing!! Only €10 as well and hands on with the primates amazing experience!Siam Park - amazing beach with 9.8ft wave pool amazing, not a lot of slides but what they do have is amazing! Loro Parque - extremely busy, extremely lost! Found ourselves walking around & around the same paths.. Don't get me wrong great choice of animals great enclosures I think they could be a little bigger. Their fundraising is amazing. Now my only fault is.. Their shows..Dolphin show - so hyped up but it was below average aqualands dolphins were phenomenal I even cried they gave such connections at aqualand amazing show! I was expecting more from loro Parque as they're meant to be on par with the US. Orca show - now then I know there's a lot of controversy with these shows but all they could seem to do was splash the audience it didn't go on for long yes it was good but again just average I thought it was also meant to be on par with the US there was only 3 out their enclosure appeared to be too small for the 6 they have. I also wanted the show to be about the orcas and who they are this would be interesting! But nothing. Sea lions - well they exceeded expectation they stole the show. Especially the big boy he was amazing!!! The bird show - I've seen better but was average. Other than the shows the chimps were lovely and adorable it's defo worth a visit but not the big hype I suggest going to all parks!!! They all have their perks!!

We asked for the bill didn't dare try puddings! they had put the meze starter on for 20tl which we didn't even eat the extra dressing they gave us with the meze (cheese rolls) and we asked the waiter we didn't order this. He sent us downstairs like we were criminals we argued with the head man whom was very rude as it was the waiters fault he shouldn't have been talking to another waiter whilst taking an order which was also rude! He compromised at 10tl we had to pay for, which we didn't even have enough for the bill came to 97TL and he took 10 off giving it 87 me and my boyfriend only had 85!!! Never go! Waste of money!

But perhaps the stand out is the cheeses. Gorgeous gourmet soft and hard cheeses to savour. See photo And of course the Sunday brunch comes with free flow wines. The price seems expensive. With this fabulous long lunch you get every bit of what you pay for. We will be back.

We ordered the seafood platter. It came with chips which should have been first clue. See photo. These were dry from being sat in a warmer for hours. Inedible. But the fish platter was worse. The lobster was dry and dead. One bite was enough to stop. The calamari was too tough to chop with ones teeth. But there was a piece of shark fish that looked powdery and grey. A bite of this tasted me like pooh. I quickly spat it out and used my fingers to extract the rest from my mouth. Then lots of rinsing to try to get rid of taste. We sent platter back. We had all but lost our appetite. We ordered a spaghetti carbonara and shared it. It was fine! We are about half a serve between us as our stomachs we're sending messages post seafood platter.

And the odd animal ”|review_476653317|We did two safari trips. One late in day and one early. Because there are so many jeeps you eat dust from the jeeps in front. For hour after hour. We saw a good number of animals. Many elephants. One leopard. Lots of birds. Really all the animals we expected to see. But the dust from so many jeeps. Some reviewers say to expect that as it is a safari. Well you don't get that in Africa. Safaris we have done there on dirt roads usually had no one else around. So no dust issues. No traffic jams on bush tracks. And no petrol fumes. A few people were lucky enough to be in enclosed 4wd cars rather than the back of a jeep like most , including us. If you have that option.

We arrived for lunch the & buffet was disappointing. A great looking piece of Pork was woeful. Overcooked and tough. The rest of the buffet was largely stuff cooked hours earlier and well past it's best. So we left hungry. Then our room was ready. This was the smallest and least maintained of any of our rooms in SL. they moved us to a corner room with more windows. This was better. I mentioned the issue with our first buffet. The reason was that we had a half board package. I didn't want any more of our prepaid meals to be as bad as that. Management assured us things would be great after that. They weren't. The take out breakfast for Horton's plains highlighted a sandwich with stale bread that was packed again to take back out of the park. The pastries were similarly stale. So we had the fruit. We took the rest out of the park and discarded it. Back to the buffets. And food tired from sitting in pots for hours. We looked for the fresh prepared stations one did noodles. Ok. Another offered what was called a lamb chop. It was more a mutton bone with a small amount if tough inedible meat at the edges. The staff didn't seem to mind when they collected plates of food we had hardly touched, over and over again. The last evening was the worst. It was themed as Italian night by a board in foyer. But there was no Italian food. There was a pseudo lasagna. Sitting for hours in a pot. No pasta. No pizza. No Italian deserts. So we decided to look at a la carte menu. It had spaghetti bolognaise on it. Great. Who could get that wrong. And we could have the Italian fix we had mentally prepared for. "Not available at present ". We were told. (What)! What pasta have you got, we asked getting desperate. Carbonara I suggested. Yes. Great. Until it came out. Whatever that thing was it was not a carbonara. It was some sort of pasta. Tasted awful. Had two bites and stopped. The waiter again collected a nearly full plate without it triggering any response. Then the bill came. Apparently even though we were on a meal package that that only included buffet. I questioned it. And they agreed to waive the added cost. Great. So I only had to pay once and not twice for the dreadful meal I didn't eat. When we first raised issues they assured us they would fix it. They also offered us free laundry and a free guided walk on our last morning at 6:30. So let's see how that turned out. That morning at 6:30 we were told the walk was cancelled because no one booked. When I explained they offered to tag us to a couple having breakfast in the jungle. So we followed them in and came out another way with the guide. I say guide because that was their term. In reality he explained nothing and mostly walked way in front of us. A map would have been more useful. And the laundry. It was added to my bill at the end. I said we were promised free laundry. Thus resulted in a 20 minute delay while our driver waited. Numerous phone calls about I don't know what. And finally I said I was going. We were Late. So they processed my account without laundry. This hotel was easily the most expensive of our SL vacation. We expected the best. It was easily the worst . Readers can check our reviews on all the other hotels. This is the only hotel in our trip that we would never return too.

As we got off the cable car there are steps without a hand rail to the ground. I have a night vision impairment and found this tough in the dark. See photo of steps by day. The staff got me a good torch and that made it safer. Still a handrail would seem an essential addition here. Throughout the resort lighting and steps are a big issue. Motion sensing solar spit lights in strategic locations woukd be cheap and make it so much safer. That said this place is lovely. We knew about the vegetarian food only policy. So we had a long late lunch of meat before arriving. Room was terrific. And the impact full windowed views of the river and jungle are the key hit. We would probably go back.

However our excitment vanished away on the very first day. The staff at reception and door were extremely nice and helpfull, don't get me wrong on that. But the room wasn't exactly nice: dark long straight hairS were already on the bathroom floor when we arrived there, besides one burnt lamp bulb, which make the black-tiled bathroom look even darker. We decided to go for drinks to celebrate some good news, for our surprise no music at all! We decided to go to the swimming pool, and we realized its center area had the access blocked. It was drizzling and we wanted to stay in the covered area, which was literally beside the bar, but because of the blockage in the middle of the pool, the only way to get to the bar was going all the way aroung the swimming pool, it didn't make any sense whatsoever, and getting there we noticed the bartender wasn't exactly very helpfull, and the pool bar shuts at 6pm. And we had no music at the swimming pool as well, only a small speaker hanging from the pool bar's wall. The restaurant was definitely good, some phenomenal chefs working there, but that's where our excitment ended. We've definitely learnt our lesson there, never going back or suggesting it to anyone.

There was a great balcony outside, and mosquito repelent available. During our 2 day stay we had some minor problems, like having a kettle in the room, but not that many wall sockets available to plu it in (we had to place it on the floor), or having a glass-bottled water available in the bathroom, but no bottle opener anywhere, but like I said, minor things. The bathroom is also very spacious, clean, and so beautiful, everything looks new. The staff was beyond helpfull, always nice and ready to help. During our stay I encountered medical problems, and the amazing staff helped me all the way through, making phone calls for appointments, helping with the driver, I have no words to describe how thankful I am. The breakfast was very good, with a variety of options to choose from. Also, breakfast area is right by the swimming pool, with a gorgeous view, very calm place. The hotel is very well located, right at Jalan Monkey Forest, it's a short walk away from the Monkey Forest, shops, restaurants and attractions in Ubud.

The place is amazing, for a lot of reasons. The staff is very helpfull, everytime I needed help with destinations, questions, concerns, whatever the matter was, they were always ready to help. The rooms are spacious, clean, air-conditioned, and well equiped with everything one might need. During our several stays there, only once we stayed in a room that had a slight smell of mold, and they moved us to a different room that was perfect. The resort has a nice swimming pool and pool bar, where we spend most of our afternoons at. It also has a view to the sea that is stunning. There are 2 possibilities of restaurants in the resort, and they are both great, with a big variety of western and asian flavours. The breakfast is, by far, the best selection for breakfats I've ever had in Asia, it's impossible not to find something you like. There's also a spa in the resort. If you compare prices to other spas outside hotels you will find it more expensive, but the services provided are great, unlike usual spas in Bali. To top it up, the location is perfect, it's a very short drive from the airport (around 5 to 8 minutes), a 10 minute walk to Discovery Mall or a 25 minute walk to Beachwalk mall, using a path that goes along the seafront.

Cabin crew is always helpful and very nice, food is great, and if you're feeling bored and tired of sitting down after long hours of flight you can always go to the end of the plane for a nice chat and a snack, it's like a hangout area, I honestly love that option on my long 14-hour flight. However, their entertainment system on board feels like it could be better, mainly because the system they use seems to crash a lot (it has happened to me quite a few times lately), and the movie options seems to have decreased in the last couple of years. Also, On my way back from England last Christmas I was carrying a bag containing records, and for that reason it was kept on the overhead compartment. On the way out I forgot about it. As I left the plane I immediately remembered about the bag, but was not allowed back in it and was instructed to ask the Lost and Found department.This was at Dubai Airport, and they said the plane was being cleaned and asked me to check again in one hour. I checked with lost and found for the following 4 hours, until it was time for my next flight. When I reached my destination I contacted them again, and they said the bag was not found. I know it was entirely my fault for forgetting it there, but still it was a big disappointment, even because I warned them right outside the aircraft, I was still standing at its door. That said, besides this unpleasant situation, I consider Emirates a great airline.

It was a bit disappointed finding out the pastry wasn't flaky and crunchy, maybe that could be due to it being on display for the day, or to my bus ride back to the hotel. On the other hand, flavor was spot on, very delicious. I would definitely return to and recommend the place.

My room with a view of the lagoon swimming pool was great. Room was very nice, clean and comfortable. Breakfast was very good and staff was extremely helpful. The only exception is related to the loud music. I do enjoy loud music and the swimming pool seems to be the perfect place for it, but once it was the whole day non stop, it was hard to find a relaxing time to read, or even make a phone call from my room. In my opinion, if it was only during daytime, or maybe only afternoon and evening, I would have had a chance to just relax at the amazing laggon pool, and I would consider going back to the same hotel.

The hotel room itself is pretty simple, but clean. We decided to stay at the second floor, which was a bit tiring everytime we went out due to the stairs, but the view from our balcony paid off, amazing view of the sea and part of the beach. The restaurant downstairs has great food, lots of events and a huge variety on the menu, no complaints about it whatsoever. We would easily go back to Kata Beach and stay at the same hotel.

The rooms are very nicely made, all in wood, so it blends in perfectly with the location. Once you're inside the room, it's very well sealed, so no mosquitoes get in. There's an outside area, all in wood and bamboo, it's delightful, it's like enjoying the beach at it's best possible way! Breakfast has a huge variety of food, including local and western. There's swimming pool, spa, shop, and daily trips offered. Wifi worked perfectly in the room. You can also borrow DVDs from reception to watch in your room. Its restaurant right outside the resort has good food indeed, quite sophisticated, but there are a lot of other possibilities very close to the hotel, not a problem. If going to this resort, consider contacting it beforehand to make sure you can be dropped off and picked up from the place, considering it's like 45 minutes away (by boat)from the main port in Phi Phi island. It makes a difference having it all sorted for whenever you get there, after a long plane + ferry trip to get to the island.

Our room was the "bech front" one, with a beautiful view. The resort provides pretty much everything one might need: variety of very good food, swimming pool, massages, entertainment, bars, day trips. And one might need all that, considering that this hotel is in an isolated area of Phi Phi island, definitely quieter than the other parts of it, it took us around 45 minutes by boat to get there once we were dropped off at the main port. Definitely not bad location, but considering I live in a remote place that's not exactly what I wanted for vacation. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. The rooms are clean and nice, but I confess I was expecting the room to be more well equipped, it felt pretty empty, but overall it was good.

The only BUT is that, for the upstairs rooms the bathroom is downstairs, and ours was very close to the restaurant and swimming pool area. Staff was helpful, even after we left (we forgot the power lid to one laptop and they sent it to us through the speed boat to the main island of Bali).

The staff was great, very helpful. Morning and afternoon coffee, tea and snacks, and a very good lunch, but to be honest, we were so busy during the whole day that the lunch time was the hardest to arrange, and had to be done quick! Not complaining, the day was great, weather helped, and I would go back with the same company for sure!

Too bad they were fully booked during the time of our stay so we weren't given a room right away. We waited for almost five hours for us to be checked in. Good thing they have a play/game room for the kids! This is a plus in my book! My nephews had the best time there!We had lunch at Marea after playing. The food was okay. Nothing special though. A bit pricey, too. I would like to commend Michelle for being so nice and friendly to us.Jessa from the Front Desk was very accommodating. I commend her for being so patient with us because we kept bugging her if the room is already available LOL. Our room also got upgraded from a Deluxe to a Deluxe Ocean View in the 2nd floor. Super cool!The view from our room was breathtaking! The room was very spacious. Loved the bathroom, too! A few hits and misses though. There was no hair dryer and the bathroom door has a crevice in the middle. The two queen size beds in the room only have two pillows each, a big and a small one. We were four so they should have provided us like eight, four for each bed. That is what they advertised in the pictures. Anyway, the kids enjoyed the pool so much that they swam until nighttime. My cousin and I enjoyed the Aqua Zumba, too! It was our first time to try it. It was so fun! I hope it's scheduled on both Saturdays and Sundays.The hotel's GM Mr. Gonzales, left us a handwritten note, which I think was so thoughtful. That was the first time I got such a note at a hotel.Overall, we had the best time at Bellevue! Definitely the best hotel to stay in Bohol! Great value, amazing facilities, spacious rooms, and has the best staff! They will always greet you with a smile!

I arrived on a Thursday around 9:00 AM. I asked if there was a room available for early check-in. Good thing there was and Vy at the front desk gladly asked for the room to be arranged right away. I only waited for about ten minutes and my room was ready!Trung escorted me to my lovely room, and helped me with my luggage. He taught me how to use the remote and other things in my room. He was so nice and friendly.The room I got was their standard room, which was of course, big enough for a solo traveler like me. I loved it! The beds and linens were soft, the shower and the aircondition worked perfectly! The best room to come home to after a full day of exploring the city!The breakfast buffet was good, nothing special though. Nothing much to choose from. I asked one of the chefs to make me an omelette but it tasted so bland. Good thing there was bacon!The view from the rooftop pool was spectacular, especially at night! The pool was quite small though, and there was construction going on. I still enjoyed swimming despite it being small and full of people. The wonderful view got me.I was also able to watch Batman Vs Superman at one of their CGV Cinemas. It was so awesome! A hotel that has four cinemas! I was in awe! I think this is what sets this hotel from the rest. Such a great facility!Overall, I will definitely stay here again. The facilities were great, their staff was super friendly and accommodating.

Not too shabby. Quite cheap actually. We also ordered different kinds of meat. We didn't know that they had to be grilled though, because in the menu, the pictures of meat were cooked. Good thing their helpful staff helped us with grilling the meat. Be prepared for some oil splashes though. Your table will be quite messy from all that. I suggest wear something dark and do not put your phone on the table! Or maybe you can just order their cooked meals instead. Overall, it was a great experience and we will definitely eat here again!

Rating this 3 out of 5 stars because of the service. The waiter suggesting what we should try on their menu was so unaccommodating. He talked as if he was bored with what he was doing. He didn't even smile! We raised our hands a thousand times to get their (waiters) attention when we need something and when it was our time to pay. I think some of them even saw us doing that, but they looked away as if they didn't see us.Overall, we enjoyed the food even though it was pricey.

The bathroom was huge (a plus!) with nice interiors. The hot and cold shower worked perfectly fine. The bed was very comfy to sleep on, and the sheets/pillows were soft and smelled good! Not much on the menu at their restaurant though, but the food that we tried were all delicious! You won't go wrong with their homemade potato chips! They were divine! The pool was also a plus for us.

It was spacious, and has all the things that you need from the basic down to the utensils and appliances in the kitchen. The beds were also very comfy to sleep on. The Internet was very fast! I loved how each room has its own router. The only negative thing I have to say about the room is that there are no hair dryers in the bathrooms! The buffet breakfast at Mario's Kitchen was okay, nothing really special. There were only a handful of food to choose from. It was also quite hot because their air conditioners were not working. Nevertheless, we enjoyed it.Now the pool on the third floor was really nice. The water was very cold though. Good thing there were only a few people when we got there in the morning.

We specifically requested for a non-smoking room, but the lady at the front desk said there were no non-smoking rooms available. The suite was very dirty when we got in. There were big patches of stains on the couch! Is it that hard to change the cover?! DISGUSTING! The bathrooms were also dirty and very SMALL! No bidets, no toothbrush/toothpaste available! The toilet bowl and the tiles were yellowish! We literally had to wear our slippers when taking a bath because it was so gross to step on the tiled shower area! The master bedroom was spacious though, compared to the other two which were SUPER SMALL! They were so confined. Claustrophobes, beware!The staff was very unfriendly and unpleasant. They do not even greet you when you cross paths. The ladies in the front desk also seemed to be irritated every time I ask them something. UGH! What a shame. The breakfast buffet served in Mesclun was so-so, nothing really special. I guess the only thing my friends and I enjoyed was the swimming pool.I have been to a lot of hotels, and this was the first time that I have experienced this. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to any of my friends or to anyone! Worst staycation ever!

If you want to swim at the rooftop, be ready to climb some stairs. I hope that you would build an elevator that will reach the rooftop soon. Anyway, we really didn't mind the stairs because the view up there is just incredible! The Makati City skyline is amazing! The pool was okay, a little small. Lots of people swimming during day and night time. Swim earlier than usual. LThe breakfast buffet was okay. Nothing really special, except for that pork dish with bagoong (binagoongan!)

I wasn't really able to enjoy the food because I was tearing up the whole time. Nevertheless, we'll definitely return and eat here again when we go back to Davao!

What can I say, the best long weekend we've had! The staff are very friendly. They assist you with everything once you get out of your vehicle. The location is superb, with SM Lanang just beside it. The best part is that it has a bridgeway connecting the two establishments. This really made me like the hotel more! They change their menu for the buffet breakfast everyday which I think is good, so that you'll have a variety of food to eat. The food was good. The usual stuff they have in hotels. The room was great; spacious, the airconditioning was really cold which I really liked, nice TV, clean bathroom. It's just sad that there's no bidet. Most hotels have them. One thing that I look for in a hotel room bathroom is the bidet. Maybe they should try to install some in the near future. Overall, we had an awesome stay and we will definitely book this hotel when we travel back to Davao! :)

The check-in was a breeze. We were accommodated right away by the two Korean guys who were there. They carried our luggages for us. They are really nice. We forgot their names though. Anyway, we stayed at the hanok houses in the upper part, or in the second floor to put it. We had the whole area for ourselves. Privacy at its best! One of the Korean guys introduced us how the ondol works, which was very easy to control. We definitely had a wonderful time staying in their hanok! I definitely recommend this place if you want the ultimate hanok experience. Thanks Doo!!! you were awesome!

The food was awesome! The drinks were awesome, too. We wanted to swim in their pool but we were told that we were already wait listed. We were number 40 something I think. We were about to leave, when suddenly, one of the waitresses said that we get to have a seat by the pool area! Hooray! She promised us that we will be seated by the pool area before we leave. And so she did fulfill her promise. Yey! I don't know how she did it, but we were very happy and thankful to her. We will definitely come back to this beautiful place! I can spend my whole day here!

I got to say.. it was just 'meh'/'so-so'. I loved the Nasi Goreng Special and all, but the watermelon shake was so bad! It tasted weird and was just unpleasant. I also tasted their chocolate shake. Not good. The satay peanut sauce also tasted weird. The staff were not so friendly, too. They were not even smiling. Maybe the afternoon heat made them unfriendly?

The staff were very courteous and very friendly. Anita, Sandra, Madi and the other driver.. I forgot his name.. I think it was Burhan, were all very friendly. They attended to all of our needs. The villa was a sight to behold. I mean, it was amazing!! Breathtaking! The pool was great, the bedrooms, everything was perfect. Although we had some issues with the hot water, it really didn't matter. It was fixed right away. The breakfast were delivered on time and they were delicious!

The people behind their social media accounts are very nice. I posted a screenshot of my reservation voucher on my Instagram account and tagged them. They responded right away, and in that moment, I realized that I am going to have a good time. True enough, I really did. The staff were very friendly. The check-in was a breeze. I checked in 30 minutes before 2:00 PM. The receptionist was very nice. I forgot her name. Someone escorted me to my room and introduced all the things inside the room; how they work, etc. The room is spacious. Airconditoning is okay. Although the lighting were kinda dim. I had some issues with the lamps. The switch on the left side turns on the lamp on the right side, vice versa. I dont know why. The TV is big. We didn't watch too much though because my friend and I used the phone's bluetooth speaker (which is a big plus) to play music. I loved how the safe is inside a drawer. Loved the Nespresso machine too.We decided to use their pool around 7:00 PM. We were the only ones there. The pool area is very nice and cozy. There are tons of yellow towels you can use. There are also a lot of comfy couches you can sit on. We just didn't like how COLD the water is!! Good thing there is a jacuzzi! We also noticed that there is no shower room, and the bathroom was fenced. I hope the water issue will be fixed soon.The breakfast buffet at Cucina was okay. The food were delicious. Nothing really special. The usual breakfast buffet setup and food choices.Check-out was also a breeze. The people in the lobby hailed us a cab. They even gave a paper filled out with the cab's plate number and name.Overall, we had a great time. We will definitely come back and will recommend this hotel to my friends.

This is the place where Hangover Part 2 was shot. It was a sight to behold. Bangkok skyline is pretty awesome. The drinks were too expensive for me though. 690 baht for a glass of cocktail plus vat. I just took pictures and chatted with my friends and other tourists.

Didn't actually knew that this is one of the best restos in Coron, well based on the reviews. Tried their onion soup, bacon sandwich and their spaghetti. They were actually really good. Too bad though we didn't order their pizza. We're a group of 7, they didn't allow us to merge our tables because their dining area is too small. Plus their restroom is also small and dirty. That's the downside though.

This was our last destination after visiting 7 islands and diving areas. Boy, it's really hot! But nothing you can't handle, you just have to get used to the hot temperature then you're okay. You can literally boil an egg here. If it's your first time bathing in a hot spring, dip your feet first then slowly all the way up to your neck. A lot of foreigners frequent the area. I was shocked to see them swimming underwater!Though there's a stinking smell coming from one of the pools. The rocks are too mossy and slippery. Also, the whole hot spring is too rocky. I had to wear slippers.

You will see the whole island from here. Amazing sunset. Definitely worth the hike.

You can choose if you want to travel to the summit through cable car or the Ocean Express (train), either way, both are fun to ride. I suggest you take both to and from the Waterfront to the Summit. Brochures are available at the entrance so you wouldn't be lost. Park map, dining guide, show times are all in the brochures so make sure you grab all of them.

Only negative is they dont have a happening reception, they need to work on a fancy reception and they should have some restaurants too since its quite far from city should have a good eating place around (though they have a small cafe next to the reception, but you know)

Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Attractions|Singapore: Tang Dynasty Massage & Spa|1| “Don't bother - you get what you pay for!”|review_475983904|Ummmm.... it was...adequate? Our hotel had one hour massages for $210 SGD and needless to say we went off in search of a better deal. We found Tang Dynasty that had all the appropriate relaxing images of supine people surrounded by candles and low lighting, so thought this would be okay.My husband and I got one hour each for $50 each, taking turns as we needed to accompany our 5 month old.I went first and ended up in a 'female only' room - not a good start and made me wonder what services were offered here overall if there were rooms for separate sexes. I had to ask for a clean towel straight off the bat as the one on the bed, nicely rolled or course, was soaked in oil and had obviously been used before. Gross.Then a rather gruff woman met me and told me to get changed - no hello or anything. I did and then it began...This woman was adequate in her technique so it was neither the best nor worst massage I had ever had. However whenever she moved a part of my body it was roughly lifted and plonked down where she wanted it. I felt like I was being pummelled (and normally can handle a harder massage!) and asked her to soften her pressure, which she did. But the plonking continued and I really did not appreciate being told to roll over with no attempt to preserve my modesty at all - basic practice in a 'spa' really - especially when there's a window in the door?!Towards the end I got the feeling we were both just counting down the minutes til it was over. My head got jerked to either side during the head massage and I thanked all the necessary gods that the massage wasn't any longer than 60 mins.

I expected to wait bit but this queue moved very slowly and I'm ultimately not sure why as the chef was moving quickly?!We ordered a no. 2 soup noodle, no. 3 dry noodle in the delicious vinegar sauce and a pork ball soup. 3. and 5. were great but the soup noodle was a little overwhelmed by the liver in it.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Attractions|Singapore: River Safari|5| “Worth it in conjunction with zoo ticket”|review_475244436|Great undercover location to wander if it's raining or super hot especially. Manatees are an absolute highlight and a must see. Great baby facilities for discrete breastfeeding and changing. Don't necessarily do by itself and do with a zoo visit for a full day (49 SGD for both).

Great to be in here in the heat of the day and easily wasted an hour and a half wandering around.Well worth the entry fee of 28SGD with the Flower Dome too. And Gardens by the Bay have great baby rooms for discrete breastfeeding and changing.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Zoo|5| “Brilliant zoo!”|review_475243031|Had a wonderful time here with friends and our 5 month old baby. Such a beautiful Zoo (really lush!) and, although they make you pay for the different parts separately (the zoo, river safari and night zoo), it is worth it. The food was quite reasonable by Singapore standards and really good. Take your umbrella just in case through!Highlights were the orangutan open enclosure, the pygmy hippos, white rhinos and overall there were a very few bars and the enclosures were really open
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|5| “Loved it”|review_475241283|A lot of reviews saying it's small but we thought it was perfect for a one day visit. The two coasters are brilliant, the Egyptian coaster (the Mummy) was a surprise gem and loved the Transformers simulator. Jurrasic Park water ride overrated in our opinion but you can take younger kids on it so nice family experience. Food expensive as you'd expect and can gwt really got waiting for rides ao invest in a universal express pass if you can afford it - worth its weight in gold on the day we visited! Early morning and end of day are the best time to get on the coasters when the lines shorter (as in none for the express lines!). We had loads of fun and topped the day off with some pics with characters on our way put at 6 30pm. If you want a pic with the minions hang about outside the Minions shop and jump in queue quick when the staff member announces where the queue is outside!

Excellent cusotmer service and facilities and kids with be in heaven here. Deluxe sea view rooms were lovely and pool just awesome. Hilarious looking out onto both the beach and shipping channel though! The seven eleven nearby (under Siloso Point cable car station) for much cheaper snacks and taxi rides are easy and cheap around island. There is a bus stop for the free lical buses here too. Would absolutely recommend the resort - we had 5 month old and they catered for free baby food at the buffets and would go out of their ways for us. Also (expensive at 20SGD) had washer/dryers to get clothes done while here too.

It's not overly expensive but certainly not a cheap way to get around Sentosa when there are free shuttles, buses and a monorail. It gives you a nice view of different parts of the island but is not air conditioned so can end up being a hot box!

Aquarium|5| “Amazing gem of an aquarium!”|review_475237253|We were very surprised with how much we enjoyed our aquarium visit! There was a lack of interpretation around the aquarium but that was really the only criticism we had. The tanks were immaculate and obviously very well cared for - the main tank with manta rays was breathtaking! The visitor journey around the whole aquarium was easy to follow and made sense with all the different areas. The leafy and weedy sea dragons, hammerheads, nautilus, tuna, spider crabs and jelly fish were other highlights! Well worth a visit - especially on a crazy hot day to escape the heat.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Adventure Cove Waterpark|4| “Great little waterpark”|review_475235118|Adventure Cove is a good day out but you may be waiting a bit for the big slides if that's your reason for going. We had a 5 month old and 4 year old so were more focused on the family parts of the park. The lazy waterway around the park was brilliant - you even went through an aquarium tunnel and past the Ray Bay pool to swim side by side with Rays! The Reef cove was THE most bizarre waterpark experience I've ever had. We actually got to snorkel in the tank with tropical fish?! And they seemed to be im good health?! No diving or fins to kick around, but a unique experience that was worth the wait and the 4 year old's reaction!The big wave pool was lots of fun too - but head here early to bag some loungers with a good view of the pool! They get snapped up early and you'll find a sea of towels marking each as taken if you're later.There is a strict height limit for a lot of the rides (107cm) so pays to check any smaller kid's height before the park to avoid tears.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Attractions|Singapore: Gardens by the Bay|5| “Absolutely gorgeous!”|review_474839073|This place was absolutely brilliant and can't recommend a visit enough. The Gardens are free to enter but the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome are a must! (28 SGD for both). Was incredibly hot when we were there so the Cloud Forest was a great respite from the heat around 1.30pm (in time for the 2pm misting). There's a McDonalds onsite too if you aren't happy paying for the rather pricey other options in the Gardens.

We stayed in a junior suit and had lots of room for us and everything we brought with us for the baby (too much!). We could even have her in the travel co asleep in the bedroom while we watched TV in the lounge area of the suite no problem.The service was excellent and nothing was a problem. It was a great location too within easy walking distance to Bugis street and Orchard road for shopping and all sorts of hawker stalls and restaurants. Easy access using public transport too.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|London: Killer Tomato - Shepherd's Bush|5| “Fantastic!”|review_423283377|This place is local to us and we finally got a chance to pop in for a mid week dinner. We were not disappointed! Two serves of sticky chicken tacos, one of red chorizo, corn and feta tacos, one of cheeseburger tacos and a pork and crackling burrito later, I was trying to convince myself I could still fit more in! (I'm 34 weeks pregnant and that wasn't going to work) That's how good Killer Tomato's food is! The sticky chicken with a Korean style chili sauce was an absolute fave. We had read a review that said the cheeseburger tacos were like a Big Mac and they were! But in a really good, I'm not actually eating a Big Mac kind of way that was absolutely moreish. A couple.of drinks and all we were set back was £45 and were happily stuffed.We will be back and are happy this wee gem is in our neighborhood.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|Amsterdam: Kade West|5| “Awesome corner spot for beer and bitterballen”|review_418112193|Kade West is a fantastic spot canalside in Oud West to have a few beers and snacks. In early September, the sun sets at a spot that bathes the whole corner in the setting light which makes it a great spot for drinks before dinner or dinner itself. They even had fantastic 0% white beer for a pregnant member of the party!The chicken wings and bitterballen were simply delectable and you'll want to order about three serves of each...or more!
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|Amsterdam: Bistro Bij Ons|4| “Great little canalside bistro”|review_418108288|This was a lovely little spot with cheap traditional Dutch dishes. There are inside tables and a number across the street on the canal too which were very scenic (beware of bikes when crossing the small street!). Reasonable sized menu with a number of local dishes - we ordered a serve of bread and butter to go with Grandmothers stew and the stammpot (with smoked sausage). Really hearty delicious dishes that filled us up. Worth a visit for a quiet meal and a few beers.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Attractions|Bergen: Fish Market|3| “Small but worth a look”|review_399998687|This is definitely not the most lively or interesting market, fish or otherwise, that we have been to. It's rather small with a few vendors and prices are quite steep. But you can get some good fish soup, Norwegian fish n chips (think a fisherman's basket of mixed deep fried seafood) for under 150 krone each. There are bathrooms but like a lot of places in Norway you have to pay 10 krone to use them (so queue until someone exits one and keep the door open like a lot of locals do!).

It gives a wonderful vantage point of the city and glimpses to fjords beyond...on a nicer day. Worth the trip to get the panoramic pics!
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Attractions|Bergen: Bryggen Hanseatic Wharf|5| “Nice to see lived in historic sites”|review_399995886|Bryggen is beautiful. It is a wonderfully quaint historic site that is still where businesses are run - not all of them tourist tat shops either! It is a lovely spot on the waterfront and make sure you wander the alleyways too. As Norway is pretty expensive all over the prices here aren't too crazy. But shop around as we bought Norwegian wool blankets and there was as much as 300-400 krone difference in prices between shops.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|Bergen: Lysverket|4| “Great food and worth a visit”|review_399544063|We had a late bar booking on a Saturday night after arriving late in Bergen which was quickly accommodated into a table booking for a four course set menu. The four course menu at 695 krone per head was worth it, but some dishes were stand outs while others were less so. The generous four canapés as amuse bouche had an acidic fish soup and mackerel butter on toast as highlights. The first starter of scallops with dried tomatoes, nasturtiums and fava beans in a light broth were delicious as was the generous main third course of halibut steak, burnt cabbage and sour dough croutons. The dessert of goats milk and elderflower ice cream, local strawberries and molasses biscuit was an interesting combo and a hit for one of us but not as much for the other.The whole bill with two wines and apple juice set us back 1700 krone with tip. The service was friendly with one waiter in particular being quite informative but empty glasses were left on the table throughout so some attention to detail was missing. Definitely worth a visit though.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Hotel|Balestrand: Kviknes Hotel|4| “Beautiful and historic, but the buffet and scenery give it this score...”|review_398904387|Kviknes is iconic and deserves to be perched on its impressive location in Balestrand. The building is stunning and where the restaurant and lounge areas are located where you will enjoy the very extensive buffet (seafood and salmon lovers you won't be disappointed) and then have a cup of complimentary tea or coffee enjoying the views afterwards.However, the less impressive 'modern' addition to the hotel in the 1960s is where most rooms are and where you will likely be staying. This is clean but basic and nothing to write home about. You will likely minimise the time you will spend in this by being outside on adventures anyway, but keep room expectations low. They haven't changed since the 60s.

Impressive lip of blue ice visible at edge of rocky cliffs above that led down to a glacier lake. Has a restaurant, small gift shop and bathrooms. Food simple but not overly expensive (by Norwegian standards) and nice warm place to sit and still overlook the glacier while waiting for the bus.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Attractions|Sogndal Municipality: Norwegian Glacier Museum|3| “Interesting but more a centre than a museum”|review_398896341|This was a nice spot we were taken to as part of a tour before going to the glaciers nearby. It had a dated but interesting film shot by helicopter of the glaciers covering the nearby area. There were loads of interactives - great for kids - but no artefacts as such. Very interesting building too which has won architecture awards - meant to look like a boulder that has moved through the glacier.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|Oslo: Den Glade Gris|5| “Pork knuckle heaven!”|review_398244028|This place was great - but predominantly for pork appreciaters! We had done a scan of tripadvisor and after seeing the pics of the knuckle - we were locked in. The knuckle here was out of this world and did not disappoint! Lovely service, quite relaxed but be warned the beer prices are quite expensive - as they are in Norway - but the had great pale ales etc. Definitely worth a visit!
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Attractions|Oslo: Viking Ship Museum|4| “Fascinating authentic Norwegian history”|review_397901651|Great museum to visit and don't need loads of time. Was 80 krone per adult to visit but worth the entry. Three viking ships found in burial mounds, two incredibly well preserved and one less so. Beautiful display space that allowed you to get elevated views of the ships too. Lots of associated objects dug up from a royal queen and chieftan that defy belief in terms of the quality they are in. Even textiles found from 1200 years ago!
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|Oslo: Fiskeriet Youngstorget|4| “Delicious fish n chips”|review_397898160|Great spot to stop and have crispy battered fresh fish n chips with a little pickle on the side. Very fresh fish and other seafood dishes on offer too. Prices for fish n chips to eat in are 159 krone or you can take away for 99 krone.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|Oslo: Fjord Restaurant|4| “Excellent option for Norwegian foodie Oslo”|review_397774752|We had a wonderful time here. Six courses for 695 krone (not including wine options at 100 or 150 krone per glass of your choice extra). Seafood lovers will adore the range of fish here but those wary of eating more traditional dishes - they can serve whale here so be prepared Service was a little eclectic but very friendly and our waiter spent some time showing us his favourite spots in Oslo towards the end of our meal. One of our party was not drinking on the night we visited and was served some brilliant local Norwegian apple juice instead - amazing.Would definitely recommend a visit.

Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|Vienna: Puerstner|5| “Amazing traditional Austrian dining in Vienna”|review_379728293|We were looking for a more traditional, even slightly kitsch, experience in Vienna and this place was amazing! Excellent food and service in a restaurant with a lot of character (taxidermy, wood panelling etc.). The pork schnitzel, goulash and strudel was all fantastic. The sauerkraut was some of the best I'd ever eaten. Greatly recommend this restaurant!
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|Kotor: Tanjga|5| “Fantastic and cheap barbecue in Kotor”|review_273846825|This is incredible value for money. We had sirloin, chicken leg and two pork kebabs (on kebab sticks) with side salads and drinks and it cost 19€! The guy who cooked our barbecue cooked the meat perfectly - medium sirloin that was actually medium. All the meat was covered in the garlic, parsley and oil sauce that is common in Montenegro and it was delicious!There is a cheap car park directly across Tanjga too which makes it very convenient.If you don't want to eat in (small number of tables) then you can takeaway and walk around the corner to the Kotor waterfront.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Attractions|Kotor Municipality: Lipci Rock|1| “You'll be lucky if you can find it”|review_273827169|There is a trail clearly enough marked with a sign and arrow, but when you get to the end of the trail under the rock face, there is little sign of anything. There is one overhang that seems to have had a protective outer wall built, but when you enter the small gap, someone has had a fire in there and thick black ash is all up the rock wall. We sincerely hope this is not the site of the 10,000 year old cave paintings as if it is, they are no more. When we looked for any other options in the surrounding area, it was all overgrown and even searching behind bushes we found nothing.If this is a site of historical significance and we missed it, they really need to mark it far more clearly and take care of it. If it was on the wall of the overhang now covered in thick ash, they have lost it and it is a great shame.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|Cavtat: Dalmatino|5| “Excellent spot, fantastic food”|review_273736267|This was a great find on our way back to Tivat from a day trip to Dubrovnik. We wanted seafood, on the waterfront in a scenic area, and that we got. The main parking area was very close by too and a bargain at 5kn an hour.We had excellent service, two courses each with drinks and it cost us about 330kn with tip (approx 50€).Cavtat was a cute spot and very tranquil.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Attractions|Dubrovnik: Cafe Buza|5| “Great drinking hole in the Old Town wall”|review_273733827|This is a fantastic spot on a sunny day to sit down and grab a drink. Beautiful views while you are perched outside the city wall on rocky ledges.On the day we visited it was bright, hot sun and people were jumping off the rocks into the water a little further down below the bar. Needless to say we ended up joining in - there's a staircase all the way down to the water's edge where you can jump in for a swim if you don't want to jump the whole way.An ice coffee and a beer cost us about 60kn (approx 8€).
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Attractions|Dubrovnik: Old Town|5| “Believe the hype”|review_273729287|The old town in Dubrovnik is simply beautiful. It is absolutely worth the visit and a meander around.Park in the Old Town Garage on your way down the one way street that gets you down to the waterfront as its a reasonable 20kn an hour (approx 3€) as opposed to 40kn an hour closer to the entrance of Old Town.It is scenic, with the usual tourists traps as well, but truly absorbing as you walk around. Spend half a day wandering the streets and alleys and you will not be disappointed.There will likely be the usual bus loads of tourists too, but there seems to be room for everyone!Make sure you head up to Buza (cafe - see our review) for a drink outside the city walls on the edge of the cliff! Beautiful spot.

There are some tourist-targeting restaurants along the scenic waterside which are safe bets, but don't expect anything out of the ordinary.Cruise past on your bikes, get some pics and then move on.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|Copenhagen: Nose2Tail|4| “Great dinner option in meatpacking district”|review_272818826|To be honest, we stumbled upon this one after failing to get into Kodbyens Fishbar with no reservation, but were happy we did.It is downstairs so I would recommend this for the cooler months so you're not missing out on any Danish sunshine.The menu had a daily fish, meat and offal to choose from so there is something for everyone (maybe not vegetarians though - as you would no doubt guess from the name).The service was excellent and the food was good - a great tartare can be had in entree or main size, although it was a bit squishy and very different from any French based tartare I've had - but it still tasted great.The bavette for a main was not the most generous but tasty and the dessert of a rhubarb trifle with malt bread crumb was the highlight of the meal.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|Copenhagen: Hallernes|5| “Scrumptious smorrebrod”|review_272816827|This little gem is halfway down inside Torvehallerne - an absolute must stop for all food lovers visiting Copenhagen.There were about 15 different varieties of smorrebrod on offer and we must have had about 8! Could have gone back for more too but were trying to pace ourselves.the prawn and egg, roast beef with fried onions and meatloaf were highlights but to be honest, all were delicious. And all were washed down with Mikkeller beer on tap which made them all the more delicious.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|Copenhagen: Kjobenhavn|5| “Fantastic Danish cuisine 7 course tasting menu”|review_272813046|This was a great find for Sunday night dining. Danish dishes, with a lot of cream, creme fraiche and other assorted richness on each of the seven plates for a cold night.The friendly staff were a little random - water wasn't refilled, cutlery not given for a couple of courses etc. but the food made up for it. Dishes were beautifully plated and the starter of oyster ice cream, cream, parsley oil with trout roe was a great kick off to the procession.Other highlights were lamb cutlets with pine nuts, gremolata and a butter sauce and the dessert of sponge cake, malt bread, creme cheese, coconut ice cream and muscavado sugar. Although my personal favourite was the brill (fish) with ramson (like wild garlic) and mussel cream sauce.With wine pairings it will cost you 100€ for the seven courses - pretty good for all you get. Maybe cycle home to work a bit of it of...
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|Copenhagen: Kodbyens Fiskebar|5| “Exquisite seafood - but book!”|review_272810375|This was worth the hype. As is usual in Copenhagen, you will pay for quality (if you're used to London prices you will be fine). We tried (like rookies) to get a walk in table on a Saturday night and ended up making a booking for the Monday. It was delicious, modern seafood, the oysters, calamari and a cheeky little fish and chips were highlights. It is easy to spend a 100£ equivalent between two of you, but it is worth it.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Attractions|Kotor: Kotor’s Castle Of San Giovanni|5| “Absolutely worth the hike”|review_272808570|What a stunning, stunning view. If you want to see for yourself the postcard shot, then make the hike. It was about 28 degrees, and we were in flip flops (thongs or jandals, depending on where you're from!) - not the best footwear choice, but fine none the less. Took about 1.5 hours with a bit of faffing and photo taking - and drinks as it was hot. Make sure you take drinks up with you in the heat - but there are guys en route selling cold bottles for 2€ each. You would need moderate fitness to make the climb as it is steps the whole way up - but so, so worth the effort!

We paid 5€ each return with Dado boats but were left waiting for the pick up as they don't wait - they come back when they have more punters. There are smaller craft that you can get 4€ return trips for and they wait.

It was very scenic and beautiful to walk around. Even though it is full of the standard tourist-targeted restaurants and menus, you can still get a cheap beer and a decent bite to eat.There are WC and a post office too for convenience.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|Tivat Municipality: Vino Santo|5| “Delicious, fresh and in a beautiful spot”|review_272805726|As we were staying next door at Tamaris Apartments, we were offered a 20€ menu consisting of fish soup (to die for!), mixed salad, swordfish with grilled vegetables and wine and water. An absolute bargain and the quality of the dishes was fantastic for the price paid. We also got a grilled calamari extra (10€) which was fresh and simply moorish.The service was friendly and efficient and the quiet waterside setting was tranquil and thoroughly enjoyable.Great value, beautiful seafood and well worth a visit.
Rachel H|F2B31B870ED1C8CDDAD730FFEF2D7F2D|Restaurant|Morinj: Konoba Catovica Mlini|5| “Beautiful seafood in unique setting”|review_272804883|This restaurant had been recommended to us by a tour guide (through Explore Montenegro) and we had pretty neutral expectations. However the scene that greeted us at this restaurant was both idyllic and unexpected. It is a surreal garden setting surrounded by pools of natural springs that has a very calm atmosphere but is quirky at the same time too.We both had the fish soup which was simple and delicious (3€), followed by boiled veal with seasonal wild asparagus (16€) and moorish grilled squid (14€), with an apple strudel to finish (5€).Service was professional and quick, food was delicious and the setting very picturesque. If you are going past it is well worth a visit.

Its a bit sad to see it litter strewn by each afternoon and it's the typical tourist spot to pick up a carriage ride etc.I would however love to see it as the Christmas market as I imagine it would look quite spectacular.

However heading back after our failed attempt at our destination, we were seated immediately at Chagall.What lovely friendly staff, immaculate presentation and exemplary food. We started with steak tartare and chefs mussels as starters - both fantastic. My mouth watering Flemish stew was just what I felt like and my husband, a chef of 17 years, could not fault his rabbit stew and would not stop talking about it. Sadly there was no room for dessert but the pancakes and apple pie were our top choices.Love this place and can't recommend it enough.

On asking a simple question about the food, "Does this bread contain egg?", a simple "I have no idea" would've sufficed. However, I got the air hostess' ludicrous reply, "I haven't cooked it you know!". Another instance in the same flight, I asked a steward if he is going to cram some baggage next to my bags, be careful as they have some delicate handicrafts. The reply was, "I cannot stand there for the entire flight and guard those bags". I find their attitude pathetic. On safety regulations, no one came around to tell people to clear the luggage kept on the emergency exits near the wings! Very disappointing given the fiasco they were involved in.

The views from the room blow you away (provided you ask for a higher floor). The room is strictly normal in size and height. There is no bath tub in this type of room. The bed, however, is super comfortable, the entertainment unit adequate and the lighting is also nice. Maybe, as Pan Pacific Singapore is a business hotel, the room sizes are kept in accordance with the requirements of a business traveler. Overall, the location of the hotel and views make it totally worth the money spent.

Dabeli is okayish as one would expect from a place not in Pune or Mumbai. The chat platter however was awesome with the bhel and the SPDP being spot on. They also have vada pav, misal pav, pithla bhakri and all Maharashtrian dishes but as the chat platter was so filling for 2 people, I couldn't try more. Value for money for the chat platter.

Farzi cafe, Molecule Air bar are working on improving the reach of the molecular gastronomy cuisine in India.However, to take this modern approach of cooking and apply it in a place where the Indian food is tasted with nostalgia is definitely a bold move. Kudos to the chef.Pricing is on the heavy side

Decent South Indian preparations including the awesome South Indian thali can be ordered without any hesitation as that never disappoints. Great sambar and chutney.I once tried their Gujrati thali which is served with starters like dhokla, samosa, kothimbir vadi and then moves to kadhi, paneer and other vegetable preparations. Nice warm phulkas and chaas will be served along with it. The chaas (buttermilk) was awesome. The kadhi and veggies were okayish. Learnt my lesson, order the cuisine that the restaurant represents!

Very chic and natural ambience of this place soothes you. The tribal/trance music relax you further. Seating is comfortable.We ordered a mezze platter of sorts which had the hummus, baba ghanoush, tzaziki and a red gravy which i had never had. The hummus and tzaziki were spot on. The red gtavy also surprised me and I came to enjoy it. The baba ghanoush was a let down. An avocado salad followed which made my visit worth it. Generous helpings of the fruit topped with sprouts, fresh tomatoes and veggies made it a delightful experience.We also ordered the California sushi rolls and the hot dog but we were not at all impressed by that. Though the attempt won some brownie points because the preparation and thought behind it was nice.Service was Ok and bordering on snobbishness.Prices are fair enough.My heart wants to try more of their preparations but my taste buds don't agree that much.

We used to never get the concept - all the restaurants in its vicinity would be packed/overflowing/have some customers at the very least. So we tried this place to understand what was happening. We were the only customers there, obviously. We had ordered the veg platter, daal makhni and steam rice. My non veg friends who came later has their order ready before us. We waited for a long time for our food to be served. The platter consisted of hara bhara kebab, paneer achari, aloo tikki and bharwa aloo. The only bit which was delicious was aloo tikki and rest was just OK. The paneer did not seem fresh and the green chutney was really boring. The hara bhara kebab was not well packaged and tasted just fine. The daal makhni had lotsa garlic but I personally liked it that way. All in all, the food was OK and can be tried. The problem however was the limited menu and much limited ingredients. My non veg friends wanted to try some fish but all that was offered was chicken citing fisheries have gone on a strike?!! Not cool. Ambience is fine. Service needs to be improved to be quick.

"A simple garden salad and farmhouse pizza should do it", I thought to myself. I gave the order and went on to gaze the mindless traffic that this neighborhood undergoes everyday. Suddenly, my thoughts were interrupted by a salad and a garlic bread arriving in front of me. " Sir, the garlic bread is complementary"!! I was already thinking that the salad and pizza would kill me but this..overkill would be the perfect word to describe it! He suggested that I take that in a doggy bag. Salad was wonderful and full with jalapenos, pickle, babycorn, carrots, peppers and lotsa lettuce. Loved it. The pizza had great topping but the crust was not crisp (which is the reason there is a 0.5 rating lower than I had thought in my mind). Brisk service, light on the pocket, simple ambience and comfy chairs make this place a repeatable routine!

Except they didn't play music coz of some technical issue, which also led to a nice setting. Food wise not the best option for a vegetarian but nonetheless I could have something interesting. Had a pesto eggplant which was served tastefully and a mushroom crostini which was nice. Service was a little slow but so was the mood of the night so did not mind much.I visited them once again and their hummus, veg thai curry were spot on. They had my favorite dessert, seradura, but it was very expensive for the quantity they offer.

I had veg miso soup and veg sushi here. I don't know whether it was the Dashi or Miso but the taste was not to my liking. Lots of tofu, veggies were there to the very dark Dashi stock. Quantity is phenomenal. What blew me away was the Veg Sushi. The veggies were so crispy and crunchy, each bite was so much fun! The dish was also served with Wasabi, garlic pickle and some glass noodles as well. The sushi is just mind blowing. Best part is, they deliver and their prices are very very reasonable. Will order wontons and chinese items next time!

The host is a warm fellow.I have been a regular visitor of this restaurant for the past 6 months now. I have tried most of their offerings (in veg). Their thalis are really good and they also serve Jain food. Their a-la-carte is also nice but it requires lot of time. So if you are short on time, grab a thali instead of a-la-carte order. Their chinese, Indian and Goan food are really good. Recently, they have started selling eggless cakes which are phenomenal, especially the banana, chocolate and lemon tea ones.

But then sometimes the quality drops so much that I regret any thoughts on eating here. The breakfast is complimentary and not upto the mark. I mean, samosas and aloo bondas are so basic, how can one screw it up!? Milkshakes and soups were good though.Really expensive as well.

Service was too bad, we ordered for papad later and he was annoyed why we didn't order it earlier. Food tasted good.

Didn't feel the love. Ordered the manchurian samosa and a south Indian thali with puri for my lunch. Liked the manchurian twist to the samosa though it was heavy on garlic and onions. The thali had 2 bhajis, one with gravy and a dry potato bhaji. There was rassam and dal. Food tasted ok. Service was quick. Rates are affordable. Ambience is of a simple south Indian restaurant so OK.

They sell pastries and savory snacks like baguettes, sandwiches. I tried a red velevet eggless pastry and it was just ok. Paneer tikka Baguette whih I ordered was also just normal. Their focus is more on pastries with egg which may be good but eggless pastries can be avoided. Their eggless cakes are also OK.

Cheese fondue was on the reason we were there. OH. MY. GOD!!! What an awesome dish it was. I can't believe I have never had any kind if fondue in my life! And the cheese fondue. What can I say!! Great bowl of melted cheese white sauce, finger chips, wedges, cheese nuggets and bread to be dipped into that big bowl of cheese. Loved it. Service was a little slow but I am sure it was worth it. Must try next time for sure.

Paul L|03DD940309EF4BF03FF3CABBC53E68B8|Hotel|London: The Royal Horseguards|4| “Nice stay”|review_511107857|The Royal Horseguards Hotel in Whitehall court is a very prestigious hotel indeed. Unfortunately for my family and I a little too prestigious! I am overweight and after a small mishap I found myself wearing a comfortable T-Shirt and shorts when checking in. This caused a few raised eyebrows from the staff, who then proceeded to treat me like a poor beggar! When we upgraded our room to a river view the receptionist leaned across the counter and said it would be an extra sixty pounds, but in a sarcastic demeaning way. The bellboy carried our luggage to the room and then explained to me how the lights and TV remote control worked, like I had never been to a hotel before. His sarcastic Swiss voice and patronizing behavior made me very angry. I had to bite my words because it was my wife's 35 birthday and so I didn't want to spoil her special day.  After checking in and getting changed we went downstairs to attend afternoon tea. But again the snobbery we were shown left a sour taste in my mouth. When entering the lounge we were stopped by a very abrupt lady. She looked me up and down and then asked if we had a reservation. I explained that we had only just checked in and that we were staying just one day. But she quickly turned us away and pushed us across to the much more casual restaurant opposite. I must explain that the lounge had just four people and at least ten available seats, that stayed empty the entire time we were in the opposite restaurant.  I am British born and the director of a very successful chain of businesses in Vietnam. My wife is Vietnamese and so she didn't realize the extent of snobbery we were being shown. Edward Sexton makes all of my suits and my usual shoes are from Crockett & Jones. But I had left my camera and suit bag at my father's home in Suffolk and so I found out the true behavior of the staff at The Royal Horseguards! Now that I have gotten the anger from my heart I will go through the rest of my review.  The Hotel is very quaint and nice. The rooms are adequate but not very up to date, our room had an old Apple iPod dock from 10 years ago! The room upgrade for sixty pounds was a river view, but no river could be seen from the window because of the trees between us and the Thames. The mini bar was complementary but not stocked with the best of choice. The bathroom had just shampoo, conditioner, lotion and bath liquid. No toothbrushes, toothpaste, razor, comb, sewing kit or aftershave like most other 5 star hotel rooms. The kingsize bed we were promised was just 2 single beds pushed together and the TV was smaller than the one I have in my kitchen at home. There is no drain in the bathroom and so when having a shower and not being extremely careful you have to use every towel to dry up the water from the room. Last but not least, the toilet is so close to the bath that even my 6st wife found it a narrow affair while using the facilities. Luckily my wife enjoyed her birthday even with the miserable London weather and we both enjoyed our stay at the hotel. But next time I shall remember my suit bag and Oxford shoes!

The menu looked delicious but quite expensive. My wife and I looked hungrily at the menu and chose our dishes. "I am sorry, we have run out of that one and that one and that!" said the waited in Vietnamese. We chose again and then waited for the food to arrive. I ordered a tuna salad and then steak and thick fries for the main meal. My wife ordered soup as there was nothing else she liked.The salad came and it was a small portion. I ate it quickly and thought it was small because of it being a starter. My wife's soup also arrived in a small (very small) bowl. It was the sort of bowl you put a dip in when eating nachos! I took a photo of that with a slice of lime for scale.Then the main meal arrived, I raised an eyebrow at that one. 4 thick chips and a few cherry tomatoes (Yes the small tomatoes just in case you thought they were large ones!) The steak was as tough as boot leather, burnt on the outside and cold on etc inside. The tomatoes were oily and the hidden vegetables under the meat were soggy and burnt on the bottom. To be honest I gave it 1 star because it was decorated nicely, but the staff were not friendly and the food was the worst I have had in many years!

With 3D and 4D they were fantastic. Our tip for anyone going who can afford it , buy an express ticket when you get there. My husband doesn't queue for anything and with the express ticket the maximum waiting time was about 10-15 minutes. The wait time on the boards were from 30-50 minutes. We filled in a whole day and saw all the shows we wanted to and had a great day. I found a lot of the outdoor areas had shade which meant no sun burn.

The free shuttle from and to the airport is a great way to start. They room was very clean. The staff were all very friendly. The position opposite Parkway Parade is wonderful. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant as the variety in the shopping centre was hard to pass up. The breakfast in the hotel was also very good. There was plenty to choose from and the restaurant was never crowded. The only fault I could find was if people were talking in the hallway you could hear them at night. All in all I would recommend this hotel and only wish we could have stayed longer. Next time I visit Singapore I will definitely stay here again.

I look at the traffic and am amazed there are not more accidents . When we hopped on the back of the Vespa's in HCM it was such a rush. I did not at any time feel unsafe or vulnerable . Riding through the traffic seeing local life, sights, smells and motorbikes. Then we arrive at the first on many food stops and was greeted by our food guide for the night. We started off with nibbles and drinks and off again to our next stop. Our guide was always one step ahead of us waiting at the next stop with recommendations on food and how the locals eat. What herbs and sauces compliment it best.i lost count of the places we went. Desert and coffee was pre ordered and when we got there we went into a beautiful old French house to find comfy couches and very quiet except for local singers. This was just magic. The next stop was more music to wake us up. We declined this as we had a big day and called it a night at about 10- 10.30.This is a must do while in HCM.

I am not an adventurous person when it comes to food but I did try most things. One thing I really appreciated was if something was not to my liking there was no pressure to eat it. As we were told numerous times everyone had a different Pallet. We started early in the morning and definitely do not eat breakfast.You are supplied with a cold bottle of water and off you go. The 2nd part of the tour is with Neville and Colleen. The information on Vietnamese culture and customs was very informative and amusing. If you are looking for anything in particular in Hoi An Neville will only be too happy to point you in the right direction. One of the restaurants were we had one of the many tasting we were so taken by we went there twice again that day. We had a late lunch and dinner.Neville was there on one occasion and enquired to my purchases and price which he said was a good price. This local knowledge is priceless.Most of my previous visits to Vietnam and Hoi An have been on tours and we ate mainly in restaurants. I have a health issue which makes me very wary of street food.With this tour you have a map and know exactly where the food you have eaten was made or purchased from. This allows you to go back later.If I know of anyone going to Vietnam I tell them this is a must in Hoi An and to book ahead so they won't miss out.

Luckily our next flight was with Singapore airlines and we could go around to terminal 3 and check in for our next flight and then go to terminal 1 for our hotel.Once we got there it was great.

We were told by hotel staff we could catch the yellow bus and pay the driver for a day pass from outside the Miramar Hotel. When we got there a gentlemen from the Miramar informed us we could buy it $6 cheaper each by purchasing from hotel which we did. The brown bus stops just outside of the Grand Copthorne. The pool was very refreshing and the breakfast had great variety. The Great World shopping centre is also very close for food from food halls at a reasonable price. The wifi was free and I would stay here again.

The service was great, our server Adam really took excellent care of us. The menu is very comprehensive and the prices are unbelievably low. The quantities are huge.I throughly enjoyed my steak and mashed potatoes. But as mentioned above, the portion was huge and could not finish it. Then our server suggested we order the Cookie Monster for dessert. Wow, what a dessert. We were three adults and two children, we shared this one dessert and we could only eat half of it.I strongly recommend this place. We will definitely stop there again should we pass that way.

We forgot all the pain and irritation once we got in the tram. But this was the biggest disappointment. It was actually hard to see some of the animals... which was the whole purpose of the visit.The place it not worth a visit and would not recommend it.

If I was to complain, it would be about the absolute lack of signage to get to the place once you are at resorts world. Asked many staff on how to get to it and no one knew. Which is odd.I would also have liked to spend more time there, but the place is fairly small. I think 30 mins is more than enough.

But I was totally disappointed when I got to universal studios. We were wandering around the compound looking for ticket sales to enter Universal Studios, we finally say a place that had a huge sign "guest services" with a long queue and only 2 of the 4 or 5 cashiers were occupied .I stood in the extremely slow queue. Observing the staff work was like watching a slow motion movie. when it was my turn and i told the gentleman what I wanted, he told me this queue was only for people picking up tickets. I blew my fuse and demanded that he show me where it says that on the sign. I also demanded that he sells me the tickets i wanted as I was not prepared to stand in another queue elsewhere. To his credit, he did sell me the tickets and was very cooperative after my bursts of anger. Once inside, we enjoyed the limited rides and entertainment. This place does not compare to the one in California.

Azzawi|167DEB66ACE6971FD382975639123691|Restaurant|Dubai: Bosporus|3| “not my job”|review_418390900|This restaurant has a very extensive menu with many dishes to cater for different tastes.But, its a shame that the staff there with their CIA type headsets and pretending to look busy do not actually do much.We went there as a family, we were probably the 2nd table to be occupied at lunch time.We ordered our drinks (water), starter and mains.The water arrived with three glasses that looked the same and one that looked different, its no big deal, it was just odd.The starter arrived, it was very delicious, but we did not have a chance to enjoy much of it as the main course arrived within a few minutes. The mains tasted great and we thoroughly enjoyed it. By now the restaurant was getting pretty busy and it was a chore to order another bottle of water, we had to ask three different waiters to get it.We then decided to have a dessert. Got the menu back after trying to get the waiter's attention. We quickly decided what we wanted and ordered it and asked for the bill the same time. We waited over 20 minutes and there was no dessert. By this time, we were getting pretty irritated at being ignored by the staff and finally decided to get the attention of one of them and asked for the bill. The bill came and they had charged us for the dessert that we did not get. We told the waitress that we did not get the dessert and that we no longer require it. She made a point to have a go at the someone that was supposed to bring the dessert and he came running with it. We said we did not want it as we had to leave.The bill was adjusted and we paid for what we ate. The reason i titled this review as "not my job" is because this is how it feels in many of these restaurants, they have the main guys wandering around the restaurant floor taking orders, then they have someone else deliver it, then they have a third type of person clearing the table.... why not just assign each waiter a number of tables and get on with it? waitering does not require a hierarchy, it requires attentive staff that are always looking to serve a customer.

The staff are amazing and make the guest feel that they are very important. We only came here because we cut short our stay at a close by hotel. It all started when I called the Kempinski spa to see if I can book a massage for my wife... the lady (Seema) that answered the phone at the spa was so customer centric and accommodating that I decided to call their booking line and booked accommodation with them for the rest of our stay at the dead sea. We were especially impressed with their "lady in red" Maria. she made it her job to make sure that we are ok on every day of our stay.This place is very suitable for a family holiday, it has so many facilities that, you can spend the full vacation at the hotel relaxing and de-stressing. The restaurants offered excellent choice of food and variety, we specifically loved Codes, the Thai restaurant. absolutely delicious food.If you have kids, you can leave them at the Kids club at the hotel which is open till late. Our kids did not want to leave club as they were having so much fun.The pools were out of this world... the infinity pools offered amazing views of the dead sea and its a must to swim there at sunset. Overall this place is excellent and highly recommended for family breaks. I can not praise the staff enough, all of them from the checkin guys to the restaurant staff, to the lifeguards. Every single one of them was willing to get out of their way to make sure that we are ok and not in need of anything.We will definitely come back to the kempinski, but next time we will try to make it a longer stay. Thank you Kempinski.

The staff were amazing and extremely kind and helpful. The views of London from the rooms is unrivalled and you can sit there for hours just looking out of the window. In terms of accessibility, the hotel is right next to a major railway/underground station allowing you to connect to many modes of transport.I highly recommend this hotel and hope to visit it again soon.

I contacted the hotel weeks earlier via booking.com. It took them many days to respond. Then I sent them and email telling them that it's the wife's birthday the day after we arrive, asking them what can they offer. They replied promptly and told me that they would give us a complimentary room upgrade and a cake. I thanked them and asked them if they can arrange for a bouquet of flowers as well which I was happy to pay for. We arrived on the 9th of sept and they surprised me by telling me that the flowers had arrived even thought I had told them the birthday was on the 10th. No major issue here, told them to deliver it to the room.We walked to the room after checkin and were overpowered by a horrible smell. We also noticed that the tv was faulty. We then decided to go for a meal at a hotel restaurant called Burger Time. The menu was fairly limited as the name suggests.We sat down, ordered our drinks and food. The drinks were brought to our table about 30 mins after ordering . Then we waited and waited for our food. My two little girls were falling asleep as it was getting late. I asked them twice about the food and they said its coming. But nothing came. Two tables at the restaurant decided to leave as they had been there before us and their food had not arrived. Over an hour later we decided to walk out. I called reception and complained, about the stench, tv not working and the food service. I also told them that I had ordered room service .The duty managers spoke to me and offered to change our room. They also told us that the room service we had ordered was complimentary. Next day we were trying to ring the spa and no one picks up. We walked to the spa and booked a two hour massage for the wife. She went there just before the time booked for the massage and when she got there they told her they were overbooked.She walked back to the room totally disappointed. This was the last straw for me. I called the spa and gave them a piece of my mind. Then called a hotel close to the Holiday Inn and booked a suit for the remainder of our trip. As we were checking out they brought in the Spa manager to us to apologize and offer a free massage. Then the hotel manager came over to apologize and to make it up to us. But by now it was way too late. I told them it's best for us and them if we left . I was not there looking for complimentary stuff. I was ready to pay for good service.

We spent lots of our time in the hotel pool, great atmosphere there for both adults and kids. If you have kids, then the kids club is somewhere they will thoroughly enjoy. I know our did.

It took us a while to be able to place our order, even though there were many staff and the restaurant was not that busy.I ordered the beetroot salad and the margarita pizza. My wife just ordered a pizza. We were pleasantly surprised when the salad came to the table in two plates. When I told the waitress that we only ordered one, she said the chef divided into two. Even when divided, the portion was huge. I loved the salad, the mixture of the different flavours is amazing. My wife, who never eats salads, thoroughly enjoyed it as well. The pizzas were just perfect. The crust thin enough, and the toppings just the right amount. This place is well worth visiting. Although it is owned by a famous chef, the pricing is very reasonable. Will definitely go there again.

Absolutely delighted with the staff and the quality of service they offered us. Everything was personalised, we felt very special.We booked two nights, it was a family of 4 consisting of two young girls. We were going to drive there, but decided to fly in the last minute. We used Rotana Jet.We were greeted at the airport by the hotel staff, then driven to the resort.As soon as we walked in, the reception staff were very welcoming and professional. They checked us in with no hassles and then the lady (Maria) took us to our room. The room was top class, very nice, large and had a garden with excellent views.Later that afternoon, we decided to do the Safari, we thoroughly enjoyed it. The guide was very knowledgable. In the evening we had dinner at Amwaj restaurant. Again the staff were brilliant.Next day, we spent most of it by the infinity pool. Our girls loved it, and were reducing to leave. I must praise the life guards as we as the poor bar staff. They were excellent and very hospitable. Lunch by the pool was delicious and the cocktails served were refreshing. This hotel is an excellent place if you want to wind down, you will be treated like royalty by very professional staff. All credit to their management for the training offered and their customer service ethos. Will definitely go again and have already recommended this place to many colleagues at work. keep up the good work.

The food was very regular and well below my expectations. Even though we had requested a table in a non-smoking area, the smoke was everywhere, and with two young kids, I did not feel comfortable. The service was fast, but a couple of times they got the wrong the drinks wrong.As mentioned above, I was not impressed the food and felt it tasted just like average pub food.I had ordered the burger and it tasted like a cheap burger you can buy in a supermarket.If I go back there again, it would be for the views and probably the bar, but definitely not the food.

We went there to celebrate our 9th wedding anniversary. The staff were excellent, and very friendly. I ordered the Prawn cocktail for starter, loved the taste and the presentation was original. There I was expecting a traditional Prawn cocktail in a glass with a bit of lettuce at the bottom etc... to my delight, this looked totally different, the sauce was contained within a cucumber, the prawns were large and filling. My wife ordered a caesar's salad, she loved it. For mains, I had Rib Eye Condabri Beef and mashed potatoes with truffle oil. Both were amazing. In fact the steak was so tender and juicy that I did not require any sauce with it.My wife had fish and chips, again the presentation was very nice, especially with the way the had presented the mushy peas. For dessert, I had the the Chocolate Bar while the wife had the Early Grey Creme Brûlée. Loved them both. Then our server delighted us, by presenting us with a lovely Chocolate cake for our anniversary. We were full by then, so we decided to take it home. This place I will definitely visit again and again as the food, atmosphere and service are all excellent.

Then we waited and waited and watched other people that came after us get served, while we still waited. I made eye contact with the lady behind the counter to tell her we are still waiting, she acknowledge me, yet we still waited and watched others arrive after us and get served before us. All this time, the staff are standing around happily chatting to each other. After waiting for 20 mins and with two hungry kids, we decided that if this restaurant is not interested in our money, then its not a problem as others will gladly accept it.We walked out, as we did, I made it known to a couple of the staff why we are leaving. One of them, chased after us outside the restaurant, apologised and assured us that if we walked back in she would personally take care of us... we thought that it was pathetic and the damage had already been done. To us, it looked obvious, that staff are interested to cater for a specify type of people, mainly europeans... fortunately or unfortunately we are not. We left the place and went to another restaurant in the area that gave us excellent service and would gladly go back there.

This place is highly recommended and would definitely do it again.Just remember to dress warm, if you are doing it in winter.

On both occasions i fully enjoyed the experience and highly recommend this place. I was impressed with our waiter as he made a point of explaining everything on the menu and telling us about the origins of the cuts and the best way to have them... his recommendations were spot on. Prime 68 also makes a point of offering a complementary starter even if you order some. On this occasion it was a very delicious cup of tomato soup. The portions are ample for all courses and are hard to finish.... Should you decide to book, then ask for a window table as the views are amazing... but I noticed that the window tables are for a larger group. Failing that, a booth is nice and quiet if you are looking for privacy. I would definitely go there again as the whole experience from reserving to paying is very good.

Great for business travellers or holiday makers.I have mixed feelings about it. The apartments are extremely warm. I could not open the big door windows as we were on the 5th floor and I have a two year old and a five year old. I was terrified they would just walk through the door/ window. The only protection from falling from the 5th floor is a flimsy piece of glass installed about 8 inches in front of the door. A child can very easily walk through the gap. This is dangerous. May be a lovely design, but its a huge compromise on safety.I think if I was coming over to London alone, then staying here would be ideal. But no way I will bring the kids over.

The place was fairly empty as I suppose the lunch crowds had left.I had the skinny rustic pizza and the amazing Sicilian starter. They both tasted incredible. My wife had some spicy chicken pasta, which looked delicious, and my wife loved it.My daughters who hardly eat, loved their pasta so much that they had seconds....To add to the above, our server Emma, was excellent and very cheerful. She made sure we were enjoying our meal and actually recommended some of the food we ordered. This is a place we will definitely come back to.

I have wasted lots of cash in my life, but I felt Disney France was a rip off of gigantic proportions. To pay huge sums of money for tickets for kids and not be able to use them in any of the rides is NOT fair. To stand in queue for over an hour, then to get into one of the rides for just over a minute is not right. They MUST find a solution as I had a couple of very disappointed kids.To hardly have any signage in the park is not right, to have a website and an app designed by immatures is a crime. To go to a restaurant at 4.55 pm and to be told cant serve you as we close at five is strange. To go to another restaurant and stand in a queue for 30 minutes to place an order and pay is stupid, especially when there are many staff there doing nothing and when asked to have another cashier, I was given the shrugged shoulder.This place needs major overhaul and re organization, to make me stand in three queues just to get access to the princess pavilion irritated me and made me promise myself that I would be Disneylands Europe worst ambassador and make sure I tell everyone I know (and those I don't ) that the place does not deserve to have the Disney name associated with it. I will never visit this place again, unless I know there has been major changes.

Overall I would say the place is modern, clean and convenient. But, the hotel had something missing. It felt more like a business hotel rather than a family one given its location close to Disney.I was a bit surprised when we ordered room service, the lady that took the order said we had to pay for the food when it was delivered as they could not add it to the bill. Which we found strange.I must say that the free shuttle bus provided by the hotel was very convenient.Overall, the stay was good and would definitely be staying there should we visit Disney.

I felt that the 10 oz i ordered was not really 10 oz. i decided to skip desert and walk across the road to Ya Hala lebanese restaurant and have a shawarma sandwich.The restaurant totally fails for privacy, my table was 3 inches away from the next. Infact i could hear the guys at the next table chewing their steaks. Would probably not come back here, as for the £33 i should feel full.
Azzawi|167DEB66ACE6971FD382975639123691|Restaurant|London: London Street Brasserie - Paddington|2| “Tooooooo slow”|review_165465809|It's a shame I am giving this place a negative review, as the food was nice. I ordered a Greek salad and a classic burger. The salad came out within minutes and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Unfortunately I had to wait over an hour for the burger. The excuse I got from the waitress is that it's delayed because I asked for it to be well done !!!! The burger tasted good, but the waitress got it wrong as I asked that they do not put any mayo on it. I was too hungry to bring the mistake to her attention.I noticed that numerous tables were complaining about the slow service.When I finished my mains no one bothered to ask me if I wanted desert or anything else. So I decided to just get the bill and leave.

The suit was well furnished, very modern and a good size.I liked the modern look of the hotel, as it makes a difference from the buildings usually associated with western Europe.The staff were very helpful and tried their best to make the stay as comfortable as possible.I am glad I stayed there, as in the future will definitely consider this establishment for an extended stay.

I am absolutely impressed with the staff, the location, the service and obviously the quality of the room.I would definitely come back again, but I will make sure I will come for pleasure, so that I can use the beautiful facilities and beach they have. I highly recommend this place and think its excellent value for money.
Azzawi|167DEB66ACE6971FD382975639123691|Attractions|Vaughan: LEGOLAND Discovery Center Toronto|1| “will not go again”|review_160056050|Went there 2-3 days after it was opened. I took my daughters aged 41/2 and 2. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. Two of the "attractions" were not working, now when there are only 6-7 attraction, 2 is a significant number. Then to make matters worse, I wanted to purchase the photos that they took of us when wen entered, but the system was down. Now if they were not ready for opening why did they open? and how could they justify charging the full fee when a third of the attractions are down? one of the attractions, my eldest could only go in it if i could go with her, but obviously I couldn't as we could not take the youngest with us and I could not leave her alone. When we left, I complained about the fact that some attractions were not working, all I got was shrugged shoulders from the manager and his excuse was they are new. Considering that the queue of people waiting outside to get in was long, I thought it was a bit cheeky of the management not to put a sign up mentioning that some attractions are not functioning... or offer a reduced entrance rate.
Azzawi|167DEB66ACE6971FD382975639123691|Restaurant|Dubai: The Meat Co|5| “great food”|review_154841322|This is a regular haunt for me. I usually go there when a feel like having a good steak.My colleague and I had the Tomato and Basil Soup, and a Bruschetta for starter and the amazing Chateaubriand for mains. The restaurant recommends that two people share the Chateaubriand as its a rather large portion. But then they charge accordingly.The steak was excellent, very tasty and tender...so tender you can use a butter rather than a steak knife.The service was very good, the waiters know what they are talking about and and are very pleasant.I highly recommend this place if you are a meat lover. Can be a bit pricey even more if you are thinking of consuming some alcohol.
Azzawi|167DEB66ACE6971FD382975639123691|Hotel|Williamsville: Salvatore's Garden Place Hotel, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member|3| “Strange place”|review_153595006|Booked the hotel through last minute.com. Picked it as a secret hotel. Was initially happy to get it, as the reviews on this site and others were very good.But to be honest, the place is very strange and creepy. It's like time has forgotten it.The decorations and design were a bit overwhelming.. The rooms that were allocated to us were old, but clean. There was nothing special about them.Breakfast was a poor affair with very limited choice.The wifi did not work in the rooms as the signal was too weak. If you want Internet then you have to stand by the room door whilst its open.. Not very practical.We tried the restaurant, which is away from the hotel. The food was excellent, service was very professional and the atmosphere in the dinning area was good. Walk outside the dinning area and you are back into the creepy decor.Overall, I would probably stay there again, just because there is not much choice in that area.

I was pleasantly surprised on the quality of the hotel and the high standards it maintains.The staff, were professional and very friendly. The room was perfect, small yet modern and clean.I thoroughly enjoyed the piano bar at the Divan, the place is lively, yet quiet enough to be able to have a business meeting there.If I do have a complaint, it would be the prices on things such as drinks and meals. Other than that, the Divan is certainly a destination for my next visit to Erbil.

I made a point to visit it next time I was across the Atlantic.The place is pretty small, but when we got there, we got seated immediately as there were plenty of empty places.I ordered the famous cheeseburger soup and a burger, whilst my wife ordered the chicken finger sandwich.I was impressed with the soup, very tasty and full of flavours. The burger was huge.... Looked nice and tasted great. I can honestly say, that this was one of the best and juiciest burgers I have had for a while.My wife's sandwich tasted great as well, although the portion was huge and she was unable to finish it.Will definitely visit again.... Probably best to choose a midweek day rather than a weekend.

We love the food, atmosphere, the specials and the service.Our last visit there was on Nov 26th 2012, we all had various types of pasta which were excellent and full of flavor..But what impressed us most, was the gentleman that attended to us, Alberto.... He was very proactive in his service, it's like he knew what was required for the kids and just did it. As an example, he split the meal we ordered for the kids into two plates and got them small spoons to eat with.Not only that, but he made sure he was close to us but not interfering and there if required.Will definitely go there again, and hope that Alberto will serve us again.

We noticed a horrible smell at the entrance as we walked in, it smelled like a kennel... But then as you go in, the smell goes away.The staff were friendly and welcoming. Although the menu was extremely limited, the food tasted good and the portions were ample.We were offered two types of olive oil to taste with the bread before we ordered our food, the olive oil was excellent, we ended up buying some.We would probably not go again for a meal, but buying more olive oil is an option.

The hotel looks dated from the outside, but looks much newer on the inside.. Checkin was quick and the staff were very friendly. I was surprised I had to pay $20 per day to park the car in the hotel car park.. I have stayed in many places around the world, and this is a first.The room was large and very clean, we had a city view room. Not much city to see, but lots of greenery. I liked the fact that the location of the hotel is pretty central with many attractions close by.we did not try the food at the hotel restaurant as we had lunch at east side Mario's as well as breakfast Ihop and Tim Hortons.I was impressed with the many vouchers and offers we were given when we checked in, overall there were huge savings.Would probably stay here again, but most likely choose a falls view room.

I was disappointed with the overall atmosphere as I found the place to be noisy and tables lack privacy as they are too close to each other. I also found the menu to be fairly limited.But the quality of the food and the excellent service more than make up for the negative points.I ordered the heritage tomato salad, ribeye steak and the berry cobbler for desert. My colleague had the seared scallops, lamb shank and the apple and raspberry crumble. We were both delighted with food, I was very impressed with berry cobbler, absolutely divine served warm with clotted cream. The overall experience gets a higher mark simply because the food and service were great.

The staff were very welcoming and made us feel very comfortable. Our two daughters (4 and 1) loved the place.The service was quick, our waiter was very accommodating to my wife's request.The food was excellent, I had a steak, while my daughter and wife had pasta.We also ordered pizza to take home.Overall, the food, service and price were very good. Would definitely go there again and highly recommend this restaurant to others.

My friend and I are steak lovers, we ordered the fillet. The steaks came in a plate that looked very bare. The meat was very dry and tasteless. We were there on a Friday evening yet, we were the only diners there. Atmosphere was non- existent. The bill was way too high and was comparable to a restaurant in a five star hotel.

Food is very good, but unfortunately as with all other Iraqi restaurants, service is always sub-standard. The waiters are ignorant, rude and look as If they hate their job. I think if service improved here, this place would get higher marks.Another point that should be considered is the high prices charged. For this type of restaurant a customer should not be paying more than $10-15 per person. Currently they are charging about $25.
Azzawi|167DEB66ACE6971FD382975639123691|Restaurant|Doha: Al Adhamiyah Iraqi Restaurant|3| “Disappointing”|review_125119853|Went there after reading reviews on tripadvisor. Lunch time the place was empty, took them ages to serve me, yet plenty of staff just wondering around doing nothing. Food quantity was very good bit my kebabs arrived cold. And for those that know, kebabs are not nice when they are cold. I had to get the attention of the waiter to get me tea and bread... These things should happen automatically. I will go back again when I am in Doha, reason is Iraqi restaurants are very inconsistent and I am sure next time the experience will be different. Will update the review.

Found them to be dated.Was dissapointed that there was no bar in the room, no laundry service and very dim rooms.I think the design of the hotel is strange as the casino is the main floor, whereas the receiption desk is in the basement.In my 3 day stay there, i only ever saw the girl in receiption. Never saw any other staff.Having said that, the location is great, The view from my room was very good.

Location is 300m off the main street (3 mins walking distance). At night you'll find street vendors alongside the main street. Do bargain the price! McDonalds is open for 24H, and Sevel Eleven is nearby. For moslems, there is a halal/moslem restaurant, 7 mins walking distance from the hotel. When traffic is nice, trip to airport is only 20 mins.

Clean, spacey and we got rooms with great view overlooking Fort Canning Park and Fort Canning Hotel, although the room doesn't have good quality of sound proof. Location near to MRT Dhoby Gaut - interchange station-/bus stop/taxi stand and within walking distance to Orchard. Air cond in one room was too cold, remote control didnt work. Breakfast was ok, but need to give more variety on menu. Pay attention to used tables as they didn't really clean the tables, they only took away the dirty plates and glasses. Check-in was long and it was handled by one staff only while there were big groups checking in at the same time. Rooms were ready after we waited for more than 30 mins. No bottle water as compliment. You'd also need to say clearly to taxi driver about the name of the hotel and direction, as they often confused it with YMCA. Helpful assistance for our luggages from Mr. Noordin (staff).

I ended up on a Duffy train and the handles for holding on have bear covers on them, these were cute. The trains come every 4-6 minutes and can be very crowded during peak times, it is nice to ride them off peak so you can take photos. We bought a 3 day pass so we travelled often on them.

The service was excellent and friendly. I met a lady on the street and recommended this place to her.if you are in Takayama and looking for good coffee this is the place for you.
Brenda M|2B3AD187A90C867D599E484B60B6B1DA|Attractions|Nagasaki: Hashima Island|5| “Interesting”|review_367003272|We booked this trip about 6 months in advance, the tour books out quickly. The day we went was a beautiful sunny day and the sea was calm. When we got to the Island the English speakers were taken on a separate walk and given the history of the island. You can't walk amongst the buildings, you have to walk on a path that only is at one end of the island. We were on the island for about 40 minutes which is plenty of time to take photos. The boat does take you right around the island so yo can get photos of the whole island from the sea. It was interesting to see men fishing from different parts around the island. I would recommend going on this tour. Tsunami's are having a negative impact on the island destroying some of the buildings.

The service was very good and the atmosphere was great. There was plenty of memorabilia to have a look at. The food was good. I met a delightful young guy in the merchandise shop his name was Koia and he was so friendly and helpful he really was the reason I had such a great night.

This is a beautiful castle one of the 12 original castles still standing. Inside the castle there are armour on display which was very interesting the detail that went into them. The view from the top floor was gorgeous. We also went at night when the castle was lit up and it was even more beautiful at night. During the day when we were there, there were food vendors so it had a bit of a festival feel. For foreign visitors there is a 50% discount. I would return here again.

During the day the park is beautiful with all the tulips on display. We watched the gardeners replace them so you get to see really fresh flowers all the time which made for great photos. This isn't like Disney with big rides this is way more relaxed. The park is broken up into different areas like adventure land and most of the children we saw were really enjoying themselves. There are no 3 hour wait for attractions.
Brenda M|2B3AD187A90C867D599E484B60B6B1DA|Hotel|Sasebo: Watermark Hotel Nagasaki, Huis Ten Bosch|5| “Great hotel in good location”|review_363181519|We stayed for 2 nights so we could visit Huis Ten Bosch. When you arrive from the station that is only a short walk away before the entry to the park there is a building where you leave your luggage with the hotel staff and they will deliver your baggage to the hotel. This allows you to either enter the Huis Ten Bosch and enjoy extra time at the park before check in time which is 3 pm. We arrived about 12 so this service was excellent. The hotel itself is in a really good location just about 5 minutes walk from the harbour exit/ entry. The room at the hotel was very spacious and spotlessly clean. The hotel interior is themed to look like a grand manor from the past, with really tall ceilings. At first I thought outdated but then I got it. Some of the couches in the corridors need replacing as they had holes in them. If I was returning to Huis Ten Bosch I would stay here again. We ate breakfast here each day and it was good. On leaving we were shuttled to the station in a van by ourselves which was a nice surprise. The staff here are really excellent and each and everyone of them that we came in contact with went above and beyond.

Brenda M|2B3AD187A90C867D599E484B60B6B1DA|Hotel|Nagasaki: Toyoko Inn Nagasaki Ekimae|3| “Smoking room yuk”|review_361652934|On arrival we were given a smoking room as there were no other rooms available . The smell of the room was disgusting. We opened the windows and extractor fan but this helped only a little. I booked on the Tokoyo site and there was no selection for non smoking or smoking room so be careful. The hotel is in a good location, we walked to all the attractions. We didn't have the free breakfast so I can't comment on that. I used the washing machine facilities and it was very convenient to be able to wash all our clothes. The rooms are small but spotlessly clean, the bed is firm. Our room was on the side of the building not overlooking the road so noise wasn't a problem. I won't be staying again at Tokoyo Inn's if I can't choose a non smoking room because the smell was vile.
Brenda M|2B3AD187A90C867D599E484B60B6B1DA|Hotel|Seoul: Fraser Place Namdaemun Seoul|3| “So so”|review_359955058|I booked 7 nights for 2 but only one breakfast was included, which I found out when we arrived. This must be a way the hotel makes it look like they are cheaper. When you add the cost of breakfast for 7 days the cost really climbs. When we entered the restaurant and started to complete the form, without looking they told me only one breakfast was included and then I would have to complete a charge docket, they had plenty of these pre printed. The service could be a lot better, when we arrived to check in there were 2 staff at the front desk, one was already with a customer so I waited while the other staff finished her conversations with a guest. Without even acknowledging us she walked off. Service in the restaurant was no better, one morning I was waiting to order cafe latte and there was no one serving at the coffee station and egg station, there was no staff for more than 2 minutes and when a couple did appear they started drinking drinks that they had waiting at the back. Customers just walked away as there still was no service. On the only night we ate at the restaurant we got very poor service, I couldn't get my water re-filled, the girls were taking pictures of each other near the kitchen. The rooms are a good size and are very clean and bright. The bed was a bit firm. If you are looking for a hotel in a good location that is clean this is probably the place for you. I just expected a better standard of service. I'm not saying everyone we dealt with gave poor service because there were a few good staff.

Our guide was good. The area is busy with lots of tourist but the Hanoks are beautiful. Some of the streets are really pretty but it's hard to get a good picture. Maybe going at the end of the day might be better. The streets can be steep. Everyone that visits Seoul should visit here. It's not a museum it's a real neighbourhood.

One guard indicated that we could come inside the bell tower. When we got to the second floor there was a lady that asked if we would like to wear a traditional costume for photos, which we did. As foreigners we got a chance to ring the bell with the help of a guard and we got photos of us still dressed in the traditional costume. There are people here that speak English that help with bell ringing ceremony. It was all free and a fun thing to do.

The view from our room was of the beach and beautiful Palm trees, we had no doubt that we where in the tropics. From the villa you walk straight across the road to the beach. The restaurants are only a few metres from the resort. We had a 1 bedroom appartments and everything had been upgraded so we had no problems with any of the facilities. There is a swimming pool on site and Off street parking is available under the resort. Eva checked us in and out and she was very friendly and pleasant to deal with. You can book tours at the resort. I will definitely be back.

From the moment we walked into the hotel till the moment we left it was like being in a different world. Marco who checked us in continued to check on us and make sure we were ok right till the end. He even went out and got us an amazing book on the hotel because we "expressed" an interest in buying such a book. The concierge staff were so helpful and accommodating even when my husband put them through the paces. Our room faced out on the Harbour and the view at anytime was fantastic. The room itself is one of the best equipped rooms that I have seen in a long time. There is a really cosy bar, really well stocked and Jimmy provided us with great entertainment each evening. This is one hotel that should be on everyone's bucket list. I had the best holiday because everything worked the way it should and nothing was a problem or impossible for anyone. Thank you Peninsula - I can't wait to come back!!!

The hotel called us a taxi to go for dinner. Halfway through even though there was a meter the taxi driver said there was too much traffic and that it would cost us 200 baht and covered up his meter. We were late for dinner and didn't know where we were so we agreed to the 200 baht. On the way back another taxi driver did the same thing - he wanted 300bhat saying there was traffic at 11.00pm. We got out, hailed another taxi with difficulty - same story. This time it was 200bhat. It took him a maximum of 10 mins to get to the hotel. We complained to the concierge and they took down our complaint and the taxi numbers and promised to report the taxi drivers and also blacklist the cabs. I am not sure if they will actually do this but if they do it will be really great as it may do something to deter taxi drivers cheating tourists. In addition the packed up some shopping we had bought beautifully and delivered to our room at no charge. They looked at the luggage we had and came in search of us in the restaurant to check if we would like a larger cab to fit our luggage. Great Service !!!

Also, staying in a campsite in April is not advisable as the heat is just unbearable. There is not much to do at the campsite itself during the day so you need to be on a full day safari or have other sightseeing arranged in the area. The staff are excellent and the food and the setting for the dining is very picturesque. The camp in general is very clean and well maintained.

There are no trees, lots of concrete, velvet chairs etc., what were they thinking. Everytime we ordered food we had to send something back as it was spoilt - this was usually the seafood that one would expect to be fresh.The rooms were badly thought out to deal with the heat. It is not somewhere I would willingly go back to. The staff did try hard and the beach and sea are beautiful.

It's warm, Cosy and homely - a lovely change from the busy, sterile and impersonal shopping malls. The food is typically hearty, rustic, unpretentious and delicious. The spag- Bol really hit the spot for me. Portions are large so make sure your hungry. The chocolate brownie is yummy so save room for that. If your feeling healthy they have some really nice salads on the menu.

We went on a weekday but there was still quite a crowd. However, everything works very efficiently. Would recommend getting the express pass. There is one for 30 dollars that lets you into the express queue once per ride and one for 50 dollars that lets you into the express queue unlimited times - for 20 dollars extra it is well worth it especially if you have kids who will want to go on one ride multiple times. The quality of food is adequate but not fantastic and quite expensive. Lockers are provided by each ride so you don't lose your valuables. On the whole a really nice experience. The taxi ride from city center costs around 20 dollars but there is also an MRT at Vivo city with a shuttle to universal.

We had the scrambled egg with truffle which was delicate and delicious. Burrata and tomatoe salad. Our mains were squid ink tagliatelle with scallops ( fresh pasta) - really delicious and spaghetti with fish eggs - intensely fishy but my husband loved it. We had a crime brûlée to finish and it was exactly what a creme brûlée should be - creamy and velvety on the inside, hot and crispy on the outside. Price is mid range but well worth every penny. The menu was fantastic and there are so many things I want to try so I think this is going to become a familiar haunt for us in Malaysia!!!

The meat can be vacuum packed and kept in their freezers till you are ready to pick it up. They even sell ice and cooler bags and the meats can travel up to about 4 hours without defrosting (by air)There is also a really nice restaurant and play area on site.

The food is delicate, succulent and beautifully presented. We had suckling pig - beautiful crackling and juicy meat - just perfect!!Jellyfish, beef tongue, Pork in black bean ( this is a must have dish - soft and succulent) and lobster fried rice with xo sauce. It is not a cheap meal but on the other hand it is not as expensive as one would expect (being a part of the St Regis). It's a formal restaurant. Their dim sum lunch on a Sunday is also really good.

There was no delicate blend of spices - just overpoweringly chilli hot. If you are ordering the egg roti ask for the gravy on the side. The roast chicken was smothered in the same gravy so the crispy skin I was looking forward to was soggy and inedible by the time I got it. The crab kottu which is normally really good was once again just too hot to enjoy. The delicate taste of the crab was completely overpowered. The restaurant has a great menu but they do need to go easy on the chillie and make it more spicy - to celebrate the wonderful spices that Sri Lankan curry has.

A truly amazing experience from wading knee deep in water to get to the island to falling asleep to the sound of the waves crashing on the rocks. You need to time your arrival to coincide with the tide if you don't want to get too wet. The property is not suitable for those who are unable to climb too many steps. The staff are fantastic and are happy to do anything you ask. It's a lovely place to relax and rejuvenate and even though the mainland is a few steps away you have that wonderful feeling of isolation.

Beautiful food. We had a Croatian cheese ( something like halloumi) on toast with generous shavings of truffle - it was so good. The octopus salad was fresh and perfectly dressed. The beef carpaccio was one of the best I have tasted. The food was gourmet but the prices were reasonable. The gentleman who welcomed us in to the restaurant was a fantastic salesman but was also so accommodating that we ended up booking a table for a dinner party as well. They allowed us to pay corkage and bring in our own wine but the price we paid for a 3 course meal with drinks and corkage was incredibly reasonable. Would certainly recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes good food and service.

We got the last booking as we were going for a pantomime and at the time of booking the table, we were told we had to be on time as we were cutting it very close to the time for last orders. The pantomime finished late. We couldn't get a taxi and we were already 15 minutes late for our booking. I called the restaurant and spoke with a lady who said that the kitchen would be closing in the next 10 minutes but she would check and call me back. She called me back (on an overseas number) and told me that not only were they holding our reservation but that I should take my time and not rush to get there that they would keep the kitchen open till we got there. WOW!!! That was so totally unexpected. Thank you, it was a great dining experience but more than that it is so good to know that true customer service really exists.

The lady at front gave us orchid but declined when we asked for photo with her, unfortunetaly we have got lower deck and near buffet so quite noisy when people came to grab their food. Food is OK but nothing special, tried their tom yum which is nothing inside the soup, but their sushi quite nice.Entertainment is OK, people are dancing and looks enjoyed the cruise.

Those people might be everyday playing with their tigers, but don't forget that they are is animal and have their wild instinct, better to keep watching when people take a photo for guest safety

We arrived on the afternoon were seated and high tea came out 5 min after being seated between that time we were greeted by the waiter who asked if we would like some champagne at an additional charge (approx $25 per glass) or tea (given a pot of tea each person who requested) we then went and got savoury food from the buffet, There was cold tea also to help yourself at the buffet m the buffet consisted of a variety of foods sweet and savoury. We enjoyed all the food which had a lot go small detail and left very full and satisfied. The cost was approx $327 for 4 adults and one child. The restaurant had a harpist playing, all in all a lovely evening. Waiters came to remove the empty dishes, the only thing I could possibly fault is very minor but there probably should have been some tongs to take food from three tier platter on table and for such a high class restaurant I would have thought the waiters would place napkins on laps, but that wasn't an issue for us. the only thing that would stop me going back would be the cost.

We found this great as we wanted a two day pass, which they don't sell and was expecting to pay a bit more.I read a few reviews saying you don't need two days... Maybe if you don't have kids and avoid those rides, personally we want to go in everything and had a 3 adults and two kids 14 & 11 and got there first thing and left at closing, happy we bought the pass because we did not go on everything.Went yesterday Monday quiet in morning and late evening, mid day busy.We saw people with the fast pass $50 extra, I assume will see it all on one day, skipped all the queues.Also single riders got to skip some queues. Also lockers have free 45-1 hr, then $4 an hour we locker skipped to save some money. Must try the caramel popcorn $8 yummy and the $4 corn dogs best I've tasted, otherwise food prices/gift shop similar to Australia . Also if you get a 6month pass you get 10 percent off anything bought in Universal studios, or use your MasterCard (we are using nab travel card no fees great check it out) I think the lady said over $50 also a 10 percent off! YES I LIKE TO SAVE WHERE I CAN :)!!

A bit disappointed then I asked do you have to pay for the birthday mud cake that was charged to the account and the 2IC apologised and will refund the $8.95 charge for one slice of cake. I think Hogs Breath should explain when anyone walks in with children the policy as it is the first time I have heard this and on a budget otherwise I would have ordered a meal for $23.00 that would have discounted the child meal (9.95)and meant my meal was 13.00.

In addition to the river & the falls from both Zimbabwe & Zambia views, was also blessed to see several elephant, zebra, buck, buffalo, hippo & a croc in the water, on the Zambian side of the park.

I did, however, have the intention of doing so. Walked by one morning, looked quite nice with some great views, did some online research on it & tried visiting the following morning around 10h40 (they open at 10, so I thought I'd take a chance early in light of not having a booking). I wasn't greeted by even one staff-member upon my walking into the cafe, even though several of them seemed to look right past me. I checked out the beautiful view; looked at the numerous "reserved" signs on all of the tables; waited a while for someone / anyone to greet me & offer assistance, which wasn't forthcoming in the least; I found myself much happier walking out & taking my business to an establishment which valued customer-service. A beautiful location, yes;I would've loved to have tried their crocodile kebabs & to have spent a couple hours of relaxation there; however it obviously wasn't meant to be & I shall not be attempting another visit.

Nature at its best. Entrance fee for SADC countries seems to be 14USD (a welcome & pleasant surprise after expecting to pay USD20). Extremely well-maintained park with clear, easy paths having several look-out points of the falls on the Zimbabwe side which just gets better & better as one progresses on. The Falls itself was quite mesmerizing & captivating for me... I probably spent at least a half-hour at one of the viewpoints alone. They have full-moon viewing nights at a cost of USD40 on the night before, night of & night after full moon. This option was exciting to me upon hearing of it, although upon consideration I realized that it's a 1.5hr guided tour & I would probably yearn for more time at certain points (& probably solo, as opposed to the chatter of a guide & a group). Tonight is full-moon / blue-moon night, I'm sure it'll be a wonderful experience for those who do this. For me, the Falls itself, in the rainforest walk atmosphere was a blessing. Warthogs on the mountain-top in front of the Falls made my smile grow even bigger and my heart expand even more. There's a cafe, which I didn't try. Don't worry about the spray of the Falls, wear a waterproof jacket or a poncho & you'll be sorted; it dries right up in the strong sunshine anyway; & I found the spray to be quite refreshing & cooling in the otherwise heat of the daytime. Enjoy :)

Walk into the little charming town of Victoria Falls is on the doorstep of this hotel. The Big Chief restaurant (used to be Spur until 4months ago) is good in terms of service & food quality. The only minor downside for me is that I would've loved a bathroom which had a more luxurious & inviting feel to it. A hotel which can be recommended overall.

Excellent service all-round; an extremely homely-feeling hotel; friendly, efficient staff; excellent hotel location. A pleasure to stay at in Singapore. The only small downsides for me were: the very cold, high-fan speed temperature settings in the gym; the lack of shaded seating in the outside / pool area, accompanied by the fact that all the seating in this area seems to receive the constant cigarette-smoke of the smokers, as this is also the designated smoking-area of the hotel, so there's no good outdoor space for non-smokers. Overall though, a great stay all-around and I would definitely recommend this hotel for both short and longer-term stays in Singapore.

Definitely worth visiting for nature-lovers. Quite a few beautiful walks and hikes. The water...the rainforest... the sounds of nature.... This was indeed my most refreshing and rejuvenating day in Singapore (despite the fact it's also the day I got sunburned the most and perspired to levels of my clothing soaking).The Treetop Walk was nice, not just for the Treetop suspension bridge, but also for the actual walk there. One could walk from the main Lornie Road Macritchie Reservoir entrance, or from the Venus Road entrance (which would be the shorter route). I used the Lornie Road entrance and quite enjoyed the longer walk. On my way to the reservoir, my taxi-driver was just plain amazed and surprised to hear my destination...and then he just continued to literally laugh out loud at my choice of destination!!! :) He insisted that "only joggers go there" and laughed that I "must be a very good jogger"! He then continued to dish out the touristy spots to me, telling me "usually people go to Gardens by the Bay, or Botanic Gardens, or the zoo..."!!! "Are you sure you still want to go to Macritchie??" Hehehehehehe, it was a hilarious trip - especially so for him, as he couldn't stop laughing :)) He even wished me good luck when he dropped me off!!!I'd probably trade a day at Sentosa for a day at Macritchie, anytime :)

Many restaurants, both at the Ramada and Days hotels, as well as in the Zhongshan Mall. Families with children hang out here on a weekend. Feels safe sitting around on any of the many benches.
TravelbyLight|FC0C28154193E29F2F704E387D0768FA|Restaurant|Singapore: The Banana Leaf Apolo|3| “Average ”|review_475536567|I found this restaurant to be average in terms of both service and the quality of food. Liked the idea of eating on a banana-leaf :) The restaurant itself was a welcome respite from the heat of the outdoors. Seems to be frequented by both tourists and locals, which is a good sign to me. Was disappointed that dosa's were only served 17h45 onward... I was ordering around 17h00 and was there until long after 18h00, especially after a lack of service after my meal was delivered to my table.
TravelbyLight|FC0C28154193E29F2F704E387D0768FA|Attractions|Singapore: Cloud Forest|3| “Average”|review_475475915|Average. Not awe-inspiring or anything. Maybe just cos I prefer more "natural" to man-made. The waterfall was too superficial for my taste. Over-rated for me, but a nice visit nonetheless.

Spent less than an hour before I headed out of this shoppers paradise. It's great if you're into name-brand shopping. Glad I visited, to establish it's not my kinda thing. I headed to the Botanic Gardens rather, after my extremely short visit at Orchard...
TravelbyLight|FC0C28154193E29F2F704E387D0768FA|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Botanic Gardens|5| “Excellent ”|review_475474844|Excellent in the midst of the city. I would choose the botanic gardens over Gardens by the Bay, any day. Would've spent longer, but the rain threatened & came down quite a bit. Quite a few walks and "gardens", including a national orchard garden (SGD5 adult entrance fee). Came across quite a few restaurants also. Only downside was the extremely long wait for a taxi.
TravelbyLight|FC0C28154193E29F2F704E387D0768FA|Attractions|Singapore: Little India|5| “Great Cultural Experience ”|review_475474121|Awesome culture-rich experience. The peace and calm of both the Hindu & Buddhist temples was amazing and exactly what my heart, soul and mind needed in the midst of all of the touristy activities in Singapore. Would definitely recommend a visit. If, like me, you prefer less hustle and bustle, visit earlier. It gets hectic in the evenings. Waited for over an hour for a taxi upon leaving. The food and service at the Banana Leaf restaurant was average, but a welcome respite from the outdoor heat. I found Komala's sweetmeats to be over-rated.
TravelbyLight|FC0C28154193E29F2F704E387D0768FA|Restaurant|Singapore: Mellben Seafood|4| “Toa Payoh”|review_474954619|Ate at the one at Toa Payoh. Love that they open at 16h00, and not at 18h00 like most restaurants. Went here specifically for the chilli crab. Am sure this was the most expensive meal I'd have on my trip, but had to give it a try. Food was good, service was good. Locals eat here too, so that's always a good sign... At first I felt sliiiightly self-conscious, digging into my perfectly presented and tasty chilli crab, fingers & all... But then I realized that everyone around me seemed to be eating some sort of crab preparation or another...some albeit very "neatly" with chopsticks even :) Didn't stop me :) Good for a one-time "experience-splurge" for my Singapore travels.

Singapore may be applauded for its conservation and sustainability efforts. Yet, somehow this experience has left me thinking that I should definitely visit the Botanical Gardens. I'm more of an actual "natural nature" person methinks. The flower dome was good - particularly liked the baobabs and the variety of tulips. The cloud dome was okay. Again... I like "natural" waterfalls :) I didn't stay for the sound and light show (which would be beginning around exactly now, as I write this review)...

However, Ive experienced aquariums just as good back home (if not better to some extent). Average in my opinion. Dolphins may be viewed, however during the time I was there, there seemed to be a show or something going on above water & there were therefore more humans viewed under water, with the dolphins just following their queues.

The ocean view was good (although one cannot swim on the "beaches" on either side); outdoor pool; tennis court; fitness centre; nice walking area (be advised that you have to sign a register each time you exit the hotel and walk to the outdoor pool / beach / garden area). Catering that came with the conference was excellent. For me, a disappointment, yet perhaps this is no fault of Sheraton per se, just that I seem to find Sheratons' characterless and mundane. Carpets and sofas old and not quite clean.

It's private, immaculately clean, has everything needed, and is in the midst of nature while also being close to the town of Hogsback for restaurants, etc. Gas fireplace was wonderful; so was the fact that all beds have electric blankets for those cold nights. Didn't like the fact that the "double bed" seemed really quite small.

The self catering apartment, Sugarbird, we booked was highly disappointing though. The unit was extremely musty smelling and overall extremely "rustic" in a NOT so great sense. Didn't try the restaurant. The labyrinth is what made this place special for me. However, the labyrinth may be accessed even if staying at other locations in Hogsback.

Great location with amazing ocean views. However, the service was so-so in more than one instance.

TravelbyLight|FC0C28154193E29F2F704E387D0768FA|Hotel|Johannesburg: Moonflower Cottages|3| “Sufficient ”|review_441982113|A sufficient accommodation I suppose. Stayed 3 nights in Romeo apartment 6. Noise from the downstairs unit carried into the unit late into the nights, probably until the occupants downstairs retired to bed. Towels were removed from the laundry basket and simply re-hung onto the towel rack in the 4 days I was there, without a change of thereof. Hair was found all over the unit (bathroom, bedroom, lounge, in the wardrobe, on a dish-towel!) Fridge and stove sizes are okay for a short business trip but I wouldn't recommend it for full on self catering (small bar fridge; 1 plate portable stove-plate). Description says "private entrances", however if this only means that each unit has its own door entry, then this is fine. Entrances to all units are via the communal garden / pool / parking area. Romeo doesn't have a balcony / patio, unless one considers the walkway to the adjoining apartment a "balcony". Only 3 undercover parking bays available to guests - not so practical particularly in Johannesburg's gorgeous thunderstorms. Bed-side tables in the unit were rustic and charming yet highly impractical, with them coming in half the height of the bed, requiring one to lift themselves off of the bed to reach for anything. Dogs were a friendly pleasure. Overall not my style, but with a convenient location.

A locust was found in the pickled olives served as appetizers, which was of no event to the partner of the owner whose only comment was "oh, it must have been the harvest". Filthy disgusting teapot mitts, probably not washed even once, even though they are removable and even more so even though they also sell these in their retail section.

At the camp site you can also enjoy free henna painting, camel rides, dress up in traditional clothes and take pictures, buy souvenirs, enjoy the tanura and belly dances.Overall, its a place you would want to go back to on your second trip to Dubai.
Yasmin K|64BA605DDA441416AAD8F0BDEBC015E6|Attractions|Dubai: Dubai Museum|5| “Dubai Museum ”|review_352011454|A must see place when visiting Dubai. Where museums are normally perceived to be boring places by children, this museum changes the perspective all together. It makes you feel like you have travelled back in time.It was amazing thing is to see how fast the economy has grown in just a short period of time. Your trip to Dubai will be incomplete if you do not visit the museum.

Apart from it's great location in Mina Bazaar near the Dubai Museum, the hotel also has very friendly and helpful staffs.They were also giving us the room to stay beyond the checkout time of 12 noon as our flight was in the evening.The rooms are very spacious however one of the room was a little smelly, despite being well cleaned up.For those who do not prefer Indian breakfast like me, I would suggest to book a room without breakfast and you can easily get a good breakfast from the nearby restaurants.

As soon as the park opened, we rushed to this ride first, and the queue became long in no time. The Shrek 4D was a fun experience too, but the Canopy Flyer in Jurassic Park area was probably the most disappointing as it got over just as it started and the queue was long. Although the park was crowded, the average waiting time for the major rides was about 20 minutes - which is decent when compared to Disneyland in Paris (with at least 40 minutes wait time). This is not as big as Disneyland though and by lunch time, we were done with the entire park and by 3 PM, we moved out to explore other parts of Sentosa. We went on a weekday and weekends may be more packed.
Mia R|D92D26FE264EB83D930EFB3E40E08A7C|Attractions|Singapore: Gardens by the Bay|5| “Excellent for an evening stroll”|review_473078620|The Cloud Forest in Gardens by the Bay is the best attraction, IMO. We took a good one hour in the Cloud Forest alone, and it was almost as real as being in a rain forest region. We also liked it better because of the cool temperature maintained inside that helped beat the humidity outside. The Flower Dome was very colorful and a definite treat to the eyes - we spent about 45 minutes there. By the time we finished both, it was almost dusk and perfect for a stroll in the Supertree Grove. The long queue to climb up to the skywalk wasn't very pleasant, and we were told to keep walking too, allowing us less time up there. But it did present a lovely view of the city, and it was nice to see the lights coming up in Marina Bay Sands and Singapore Flyer. We spent close to ten minutes on the skywalk.The best time to visit the gardens is in the evening, starting by 4 PM and finishing by 7 PM. Wearing comfortable shoes and carrying enough water are recommended.

Before I checked into the Bjørvika Apartments I've sent them an email as well as gave them a call , requesting to be as near the city centre as possible ( near the blue Plaza hotel ) and they assured me that the apartment is so close to the hotel it only takes 5 or less to walk , felt very excited and happy about it , cancelled my reservation with the blue raddison hotel and waited for confirmation , at a later stage I found out that we only get the address a day before the arrival which felt a bit strange to me, so I called them again requesting to check in near the hotel since it was my original request and condition , I was met with the same hospitality and been assured that its just 5 minutes on the day of the arrival , I received an SMS stating the location of the apartment which is 1 km away from the hotel , and even though as a reader you might think this is nothing ,in a very cold winter city every meter can mean a huge difference specially for someone who's on a business trip and not interested in snow or the coldness of the city. I therefor rate this apartment as poor for their lack of communication as well as their misleading promises , I am more than happy to send my confirmation emails to any guest that would like to follow this up or if you want me as a witness to confront booking.com for a refund if needed , by the way if you cancel this apartment you will have to pay the full amount for the entire stay ( very calculated move , staff are very cunning ) they do not allow any early checkin , and people will have to wait hours as the checkin exactly at 15.00 hours , I felt its too much for an apartment , next time , If I ever come to Oslo again I will definitely check in Blue Raddison hotel , have to admit we all make mistakes and I have to pay the price for it now Regards Eddie

The hotel states its a 4 stars hotel * No manager onboard * Hotel is far away from the beach ( they have a shuttle service ) however the driver decide whom to take , (if you are white race perhaps you might get away with it ) we had to wait ages each time to get a shuttle service , driver with extreme bad attitude even though I gave him 100Pesos which is wayyyy too much for 5 minutes drive (each time) and they are still not happy * rooms ( we got upgraded to a pent house 1509) a total nightmare to go up the steps , huge winds caused me to get sick and end up in hospital paying 3200 pesos for the visit and delayed flights * breakfast comes without tea or coffee you have to pay for it Dangerous hotel highly unrecommended ( PS everyone on the island states its a strange hotel , I would never ever put my feet in that hotel again ) already raised dispute case with booking.com ( I also wouldn't suggest doing any bookings with booking.com they have changed and the only thing they think about is money ) no customer satisfaction what so ever. * Wifi doesn't work

We were upgraded and that evening a bag arrived in our room filled with delicious chocolate and biscuits! We were also given a complimentary meal which I expected to be from the dinner buffet, but no, we were treated to four courses including salmon, then fruit followed by crab and finally chicken pastry tarts before going to the buffet and then having cake and fruit! Each coursecwas followed by a glass of cognac and presents for us all. My husband was also given three bouquets of flowers to give to myself and our daughters. Absolutely amazing service.The hotel itself is close to the old city and there are plenty of taxis available at the front door but a Tuk tuk ridecis a must! The rooms were lovely and had a fully stocked mini bar, hairdryer in the bathroom and a desk and sitting area. I can fault this hotel or the staff in any way and would definitely recommend staying there when in Chiang Mai.

Taxi dropped us off at the front door and it was very clearly signposted to the Billiards Room where they're serving the famous Singapore Sling whilst renovations are being carried out. There is a queueing system in place but we were shown to our table very quickly and almost immediately a waiter arrived to take our order, obviously Singapore Slings were a must! Our daughters thought it very amusing that in a place as clean as Singapore, you were encouraged to loiter the floor with the nut shells! We spent a good 2 hours and at no point were we made to feel we should leave, it's a very relaxed atmosphere.A visit to the gift shop is also a must, personally I didn't feel it was expensive, after all it's an experience that you won't be repeating on a regular basis. We had been told before our visit there was a smart but casual dress code and definitely no flip flops or shorts, however, when we arrived the majority of guests were in shorts, so no need to feel you need to dress up if you don't wish to.

Fantastic views over the city and takes roughly about 15 mins with enough time at the top to allow you to take photos.

We went early morning midweek and it's wasn't too busy. Roller coasters were good for afults and older children and plenty to keep the younger ones amused.Slightly confusing to get too as we had taken the cable car over to Sentosa. If you're using this option, you then need to get another cable car and the monorail to the park but not difficult to do and good fun.

The hotel does run a shuttle bus to the nearest station and from there's it's quick and easy to catch the metro to the rest of the city. Dinner in the restaurant is a must, buffet style but such a fantastic choice that caters for all tastes. The pool is lovely and plenty of sunloungers and chairs.Top tip - the rooms offer a free phone that you can take out and about with you. It also allows you to book attractions at a discount, no need to download anything, just take the phone with you and snowcat the ticket counter. We found it was cheaper for us to do that than buy the Singapore Passes.

Iit was extremely busy and personally I do t think it was worth climbing the 200 + steps for. The monkeys are fun but be careful as they can creep up on you and try to steal your sunglasses or get into your bag. Best part about it was it's free and not too far from the city. If you're taking a taxi, ask him to wait for you, you won't be long!

The barmaid did say to pop in early evening as they get busy for dinner from 7pm onwards. Fair enough so far. We did as we were asked and arrived about 6.30pm to be told by the very rude barman 'we have no tables as we have a party of 7 arriving in 15 mins and you should have pre-booked!' The barmaid we originally spoke to refused to get involved and we were told 'if you can find a table, take it but there's no point in looking'! This was in front of a bar full of customers who by now had all stopped to listen. We were made to feel very uncomfortable and decided to go to to the local hotel instead. The bar looked lovely and there were plenty of tables outside, however staff could certainly do with a detailed lesson in customer service which is a shame as it's near the ferry terminal and could be a lovely place to have a meal whilst waiting for the ferry, if it wasn't for the awful staff attitudes.

What set it out from the other restaurants in the surrounding area, was no pressure from staff to go in and order. Very laid back, just take a table and wait to be served. Baguettes are especially good but far too big for one person! Excellent staff, excellent food and excellent value for money.

The hotel itself is lovely, however, the surrounding area isn't. It's set in a residential area overlooking waste ground and the surrounding streets are covered in rubbish, which doesn't make the 10 minute walk down to the beach particularly pleasant. Check in/out was very straightforward and the reception staff, particularly Richard, were extremely helpful. We were half board and the food was what you would expect from a 3 or 4 star hotel. The restaurant was always very busy but Sharon and her staff were wonderful and we never had to wait more than a few minutes for a table. My only complaint regarding the restaurant was that you had to pay for your drinks at dinner before leaving the restaurant each evening. Very embarrassing as we weren't aware of this and were shouted back to pay the bill on our first night! We had a suite which consists of 2 bedrooms, living room and 2 bathrooms, more than enough room for a family of 4. The rooms were cleaned every day and to a fairly high standard. The indoor pool was fantastic and was usually very quiet. The only drawback to staying in the Soreda was the amount of school children staying there, very rude, loud and didn't take into consideration that there were other guests. Reception, however, were very good at asking them to behave. Would recommend the Soreda but not if you're looking for a peaceful break with great views.

We had to queue each time but not for long and the owner was very good at keeping us updated at how long it was going to take to get a table. Food freshly cooked so be prepared to wait, but so worth it, especially the garlic bread with cheese! Nice touch was the free shots for adults and lollies for kids. Would definitely recommend, cheerful, helpful staff and good value for money

The train driver stopped to feed the animals which came right up to the train so you could touch them. We even ended up with some very friendly monkeys in the train with us! Highlight for our children was getting their photo taken holding a lion cub. Fantastic day out for all the family.
K4rsty|F6FA883559B3E369797B737DBD227B9B|Hotel|Agadir: Agador Tamlelt|4| “Bit concerned at first but loved it!”|review_115538496|We were slightly concerned about this hotel as we had read quite a few bad reviews. However, on checking in we were immediately put at ease. We had a family room that comfortably slept 2 adults and 3 children, this comprised of a living area, with single bed and two bedrooms with double/twin beds. Only drawback to the room was no internal doors for privacy and the balcony was quite small and the seagulls woke us up early each morning!. Rooms were cleaned every day and towels changed when you required them to be. Staff at hotel couldn't do enough to help, especially Mohammed, the pool man. We found that if you tipped him 20 dirham every couple of days, he was more than happy to find you sun beds and umbrellas as the main pool does get extremely busy. We were lucky to have a friend who got up at 5am every day to get sun beds for us all! You have to pay a deposit of 10 dirhams for beach towels and have to change them every two days. The woman who managed the towels was extremely rude and arrogant. The food in the main restaurant, the Oasis, was very boring after a few days but there are 5 themed restaurants that you can go to once during your stay. The Pizzeria was the only one we went to and it was lovely. Again, we tipped our waiter Hamid, and he kept a table for us at breakfast and dinner which was a godsend when there was five of us. Best time to go for breakfast is between 9.30am and 10.00 am and the old man who makes the pancakes loves being thanked in French! Best time for dinner is about 7pm when the restaurant has just opened. We didn't have lunch often in the restaurant as there is a stall by the main pool serving paninis and crepes which were lovely, you did have to pay for these though. The Pizzeria also served burgers, hot dogs and chips at lunch time which were free. If you go out the reception at the Caribbean side of the hotel and turn right you come to a fantastic Chinese restaurant, which our children all enjoyed. If you go out the El Pueblo Tamlelt side there is a little restaurant called 'Little Norway' which is equally good. Pizza Hut and McDonalds are about a 10 minute walk away down by the beach. The animation team were fantastic and always tried to get you to join in but were very respectful if you said no, they do a dance 3 times a day which does become a bit irritating after a while! They had a kids disco every night and then entertainment from about 10pm each night, we went to one of the shows (Saturday) and it had an aquatic theme and was just amazing. There is also a kid's club but our children were more than happy to play in the pool with friends. Outside of the hotel, there is a lot of building work going on and we could quite happily have spent all day watching the builders, health and safety is non existent! Down by the beach you do get hassled by traders but if you say no often enough and walk on they do get the message. if you go to McDonald's sit at a table away from the edge of the pavement and you won't get hassled. Don't make the mistake of getting your photos taken with the men dressed as traditional water sellers as they will charge you 300 dirhams for the privilege, even though you are taking the photos! The little zoo which is free is a nice way to spend an hour or so and the train that goes round Agadir is also fun for kids. We did a trip to Taroudant which was half a day and cost a hundred quid. Personally, I don't feel it was worth it as you went to a souk for a walk around but didn't have time to stop and haggle! it was nice stopping to see the goats climbing the trees though! The hotel has it's very own camel called Choclate and you can pay for rides round the grounds on her. All in all, I would certainly recommend this hotel and wouldn't hesitate in going back.

However, it is not my favorite national park in Taiwan. I prefer long hikes with a lot of activities. Yangminshan felt overly commercialized to me. Probably due to the fact it was right next to Taipei, the park felt very crowded. Nonetheless, if given a chance, I would return to Yangmingshan, because it feels like I did not get get a chance to see everything in the park. Just, out of my national park experiences in Taiwan, Xitou, Kenting, and Taroko were all more enjoyable.

The two gardens did not disappoint. The area was absolutely gorgeous. The architecture was stunning and did a great job balancing with nature. It truly felt tranquil, specifically with the Malay Water Monitors moving throughout the area. If you're in Singapore and want to visit a less touristy area for a moment of peace and quiet, I highly suggest visiting the Chinese and Japanese Gardens.

Instead, I discovered that everywhere in the park was very busy. I was only able to ride 3 rides in a 7 hour period, because I had to wait an average of an hour plus for the rides I did ride. I feel spoiled, because I am used to Universal Studios Orlando, which is a bigger park. The Singapore version felt like it was half the size and therefore, a little bit disappointing.

I was highly impressed with the hotel. Maybe it is because I rarely stay in resorts. However, I felt the all you can eat buffet, the beach access albeit via an underground tunnel, and the highly friendly staff were all well worth the investment. Two days in the resort cost less than two days in a hotel in Jiaoxi which was not nearly as nice. If I go to Kenting again, I would certainly stay in this hotel again.

This is a good thing. The staff itself at the hotel were very friendly. However, the overall facility was of poor quality. The shower did not have enough water pressure, the rooms were not fully cleaned, and it was easy to hear the other guests in the hotel walk up and down the hallway. I am sure once the new facility opens, many of these issues will be resolved. The hotel was just an old building that needs to be replaced.

I then walked from Jiaoxi Bus Station to Wufengchi Waterfall trail. Overall, it was about a 2 mile or 3 kilometer walk. The trail itself was relatively easy with some beautiful views of the different waterfalls. However, the must do was Sacred Mountain Peak at the end of the Wufengchi Waterfall trail. This is a beautiful mountain on a tricky trail. I would highly suggest bringing plenty of water to complete this hike. Despite being difficult at times, this hike, however, is well worth it,

I was absolutely amazed how nature fines a way. The entire house was overpowered by the tree. What was once a living location was now tree roots and branches.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Tainan: Chimei Museum|3| “Beautiful architecture, average museum display”|review_436768634|Visiting the Chimei Museum made me realize that I am not good at appreciating the beauty of art. The architecture and the grounds are beautiful. If you are unable to afford to travel to Italy, the Chimei Museum will suffice as a great substitute. However, I found the temporary origami exhibit inside the museum a bit of a disappointment. I kept thinking that I spent money to just see paper.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Hong Kong: Mongkok|3| “Very crowded”|review_419651819|My girlfriend and I stayed in an apartment between the Mongkok and Prince Edward train stations. The neighborhood was very busy, but at the same time felt run down. If you are only in Hong Kong for a couple days, I would suggest skipping Mongkok. Overall, it was just a dirtier and more congested part of the city.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Hong Kong: Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery (Man Fat Sze)|4| “Be prepared for a workout”|review_419651525|I have been to the 10,000 Buddhas Temple/Monastery twice. I went in May 2011 and then again in September 2016. Both times, I remember the monastery being really hot and feeling quite tired when I reached the top. However, in my travels in Asia, I have not seen another monastery quite like the 10,000 Buddhas one. With so many different Buddhas, the artwork that went into making the temple is truly special. If you are looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of central Hong Kong, I would highly suggest traveling to the New Territories and the 10,000 Buddhas for a bit of tranquility in the mega metropolis.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Kota Kinabalu: Tunku Abdul Rahman Marine Park|5| “Beautiful Snorkeling and Crystal Clear Water”|review_416058339|At the last minute, I joined a family from Perth, Australia on their chartered journey to Salug Island. The experience ended up being one of the best in my life. Growing up in land locked Denver, I went snorkeling for the first time. The experience was incredible. I could have not asked for a better experience, culminating in viewing a Clown Fish or "Nemo."
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Aurora: Aurora Reservoir|4| “Always Something New at the Reservoir”|review_416057234|I grew up in Aurora and visited the reservoir many times as a kid. What once seemed so far away on Quincy, is now nearly on the eastern edge of the city. The 8 mile hike around the reservoir is great exercise. I highly suggest doing it. However, be careful of rattlesnakes. I encountered one while hiking with my dad and girlfriend.The swimming section is okay. The only problem is it feels kind of small. If one wants to get a good swim in, they need to swim horizontally instead of vertically. Otherwise, the swimmer area is not bad and the reservoir is an overall good place.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Aurora: Horseshoe Park|3| “Just another park”|review_379303058|I used to go running through Horseshoe Park all the time in high school. I feel like Horseshoe, like any other park, has both its pros and cons. The pros of the park, it is connected to many other city bike trails, so one could continue along the bike path for miles, with Horseshoe park running north into the Highline Canal and south into Cherry Creek State Park. Additionally, the park hosts baseball fields and a tiny creek. There was even one time that I saw some wild deer running through the park. The con, the park is not really well-maintained. Too frequently, the park has some form of graffiti in it, making an otherwise pretty park less attractive.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Taichung: Taiwan High Speed Rail Taichung Station|4| “Very convenient”|review_379301100|I have ridden the Taiwan High Speed rail on numerous occasions. My latest was in March 2016. Your first time riding the rail, it is a true treat, as you travel at greater than 200 miles per hour. Additionally, with new stations in Changhua, Yunlin, and Miaoli, the HSR now gives you access to more parts of Taiwan. The speed rail turns a 2 1/2 bus hour ride from Taichung to Taipei into an hour journey. Therefore, I highly recommend the HSR. The only disadvantage, the price. At 700 NTD from Taichung to Taipei, the train is not cost effective. The bus ticket is a fraction of the price (250 NTD), but the journey is two times as long.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Taipei: Taipei Zoo|4| “One of the better zoos I have visited”|review_375629728|I have not been to Taipei Zoo in a while, but I was surprised. The zoo is huge, with animals from all over the world, including lions, tigers, chimpanzees, gorillas, etc. The highlight of the zoo is seeing the Giant Pandas. As a kid, I loved visiting zoos, but have never had the chance to see Giant Pandas in a zoo. Taipei Zoo was my first chance to do so and I felt it was well worth it. Another thing that I found very interesting was how close the animals were. I have never been to another zoo where I could get as up close and personal with the animals as I could at the Taipei Zoo. If you are visiting Taipei, I would consider going to the zoo as one of the top attractions.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Matsumoto: Matsumoto Castle|5| “Beautiful and perfect for the history buff”|review_375307096|I have visited many different locations in Japan, but Matsumoto is one of my favorite locations. It is specifically one of my favorites because of the castle. Being Japan's first castle, Matsumoto Castle settles perfectly within the Japanese Alps. I visited during winter, when the sun glistened off the snow, causing the entire area to just light up. The castle itself is full of interesting historical artifacts about the construction of the castle. If you visit Matsumoto, I would highly suggest visiting Matsumoto Castle.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Restaurant|Shibuya: Chiles Mexican Grill, Harajuku|5| “Gave me the Mexican food I was missing”|review_374983755|When I was in Tokyo, Chile's gave me the Mexican food that I was missing. Having spent most of the past 2 years living in Taiwan, Chile's was exactly what I was craving. The Mexican food was just as good as the burritos that I could get back home in Denver. The only downside was that the serving size was relatively small. In order to get a "true bang for my buck," I had to order two meals. Otherwise, the food and tasted just like authentic Mexican food.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Chuo: Ginza|3| “Go if you are rich”|review_374978669|I did not spend enough time in Ginza to give the neighborhood a fair review. I had one day left in Tokyo and wanted to see as much of the city as possible. However, when visiting Ginza, I truly felt out of place. The area is clearly built and designed for the very wealthy. Once I was there, I knew that I did not belong in the neighborhood. I did a little window shopping before quietly moving onto my next location. If you have the money, I would suggest visiting Ginza. It was unlike any other location I have seen in Asia with the high quantity of luxury shops there. If you do not have the money, it is best to visit other locations. Japan and Asia overall have many luxury shops, so it won't be hard to find many of the same items in a different and possibly cheaper location.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Nagano: Zenko-ji Temple|4| “Large, beautiful, historic temple”|review_374977914|After visiting a lot of Asian temples, they start to get repetitive and lose their value. However, I never felt this way about Zenko-ji Temple. The temple was one of the largest that I had visited during my three trips to Japan. The initial entrance had Buddha statues lined along the wall, leading up to a main gate and the main temple. One does have to spend money to go deeper within the main temple, something that I opted out of doing. To the side of the temple, there were additional mini temples and a large bell that you could ring. If you are visiting Japan, I would highly suggest visiting Zenko-ji Temple and the Nagano area. Having been to Osaka, Kyotok, Tokyo, Yokohama, and Nagano area, I consider Nagano one of my favorite parts of Japan.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Yunlin County: Janfusun Fancyworld Theme Park|3| “Why was the water park closed?”|review_374972791|I visited Janfusun Fancyworld in November 2015 with my girlfriend. The park is built on a hilly area, which offers some beautiful views of the mountains across from the park. Overall, the park made me appreciate how spoiled I was to have visited places like Disney World and Universal Studios as a kid. I enjoyed the acrobat show performed by a team of acrobats from Eastern Europe. I was truly impressed by their stunts. However, I was also really disappointed that the water park was closed due to it being winter. While the calendar said November, in Southern Taiwan, it is still 26 degrees C or 80 degrees F. I understand the cultural reasoning behind closing the water park, but it did not change the fact it was hot outside. It is always possible though that my opinion of the park would change that day if the water park was open. You never know.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Restaurant|Taichung: The Naked Cafe|4| “Amazing Salmon Bagel”|review_374783675|In Taiwan, it has been difficult to find a good bagel or pink salmon. The Naked Cafe does both of these well. Each time I visit, I order the same thing, the Salmon Bagel, because it is too good to pass up. So my advice is simple, if you are looking for a cheap meal (approximately 150 NTD) and are looking for a good bagel or sandwich, then I would highly suggest The Naked Cafe. The sandwiches remind me of the same kind of sandwiches that you can get at Einstein's Bagels in the US.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Taichung: Taichung Park|3| “Has its beautiful places, but I would suggest visiting other locations”|review_374667909|I have been to Taichung Park numerous times on my way to the Yichung Night Market. The park is just North of the Taichung train station. The park has some beautiful places, like the park's central bridge; however, overall the park feels very dirty and run down. At times, the park can host very unique features. After Chinese New Year, the park was full of monkey lanterns to celebrate the year of the monkey. This particular time, the park was a must see. However, aside from this time, I would suggest visiting other Taichung parks, like People's Park instead.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Taichung: FengJia Night Market|3| “Good for shopping, but overcrowded”|review_373866374|I have been to Fengjia 3 times now. Each time, my impression is pretty much the same. The area is great if you are serious about shopping. Also, I had an incredible Cuban sandwich there for only 120 NTD. A great Cuban is hard to find in Taiwan. On the other hand, the place is "crazy busy." You are constantly looking out for scooters while walking on the side of the road and competing with crowds of people for limited space in shops. If you want to fight crowds, you can visit Fengjia. If you want a better night market with less crowds, then I would suggest visit Yichung Night Market,
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Restaurant|Denver: The 1 Up LODO|4| “Unique, but it gets crowded”|review_373633106|I went here on numerous occasions from 2012 to 2014. The place is a cool bar that offers vintage video games to play. It is a great place to visit with either a date or with a group of friends for a couple of beers and some relaxation. The biggest downside is how crowded the bar can be. By 10 PM on a Friday or Saturday night, you are likely looking at a place packed wall to wall with people. Great for fun, not so great if you want to avoid a crowd.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Denver: Coors Field|5| “I grew up in Coors Field, so I am a little biased”|review_373632505|I rated Coors Field a 5, but with hesitation. The Coors Field of my childhood was unequivocally a 5. However, I feel like the secret has gotten out on how beautiful this ballpark is. As a result, ticket prices have continued to rise and the quality of baseball the Rockies produce continues to me dismal. The stadium offers many unique things. The garden in center field is beautiful. The club level is luxurious. Just, the stadium is not the same as it was in 1995 to 2000 during its early years.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Taichung: Taroko Mall|3| “Nothing special”|review_368432950|Many places in Taiwan have upscale luxury stores, such as Coach, Tiffany's, etc. The Modemall is not that kind of place. The mall is over 12 floors tall, but each floor only hosts a couple stores. So all in all, the mall is about the same size as a typical American mall, the only difference being, the stores are spread out over more floors. On the 3rd floor, they have a movie theater. The theater is pretty basic. If you are looking for a great shopping experience in Taichung, I would recommend a place like Chung Yo Department Store for the diverse options. And if you are looking to experience the biggest mall in Taiwan, then head to the Dream Mall in Kaohsiung.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Chiayi County: Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum|4| “Not as impressive as Taipei's”|review_366312643|At the time of this review, I live in Taichung, Taiwan. I visited the Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum with my girlfriend and her family in January 2016. Like the Taipei Museum, the museum holds many historical artifacts from different Asian countries. However, overall, the museum is pretty small, only two floors with an average of 3 to 4 rooms on each floor. Patrons are also not allowed to take pictures. Thus, the overall experience is good to enjoy history and art, but not something I would recommend for the average traveler.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Shibuya: Hachiko|3| “I don't see what the big deal is”|review_366310795|I viewed Hachiko on my way back from exploring the Shibuya ward. Overall, the area was packed with people and I was barely able to navigate my way through the crowd. I honestly felt that it was too much hassle to simply view one dog statue.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Bunkyo: Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|5| “Self-proclaimed baseball nerd who loved his time there”|review_366309594|As the previous reviewer noted, I also do not speak or read Japanese, however, this did not hinder my experience. In spite of the language obstacle, I nonetheless, enjoyed the experience. Many of the displays had signs in both English and Japanese, making it easy to understand. Overall, I would consider the plaque of the baseball Hall of Fame inductees as the highlight of the visit. Each plaque was unique and provided perspective on the history of baseball in Japan, dating back to its first introduction by an American schoolteacher to contemporaneous times.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Yamanouchi-machi: Jigokudani Snow Monkey Park|4| “Depends on what you are looking for”|review_365997933|If I had visited this place prior to August 2014, I would have been enamored with it. However, I have since traveled to other places with wild monkeys, so to me, this just felt like another tourist trap. Yes, the monkeys are cute and entertaining. However, with so many tourists from all over the world there, it was hard to truly experience the moment. One has to fight through a crowd of tourists to get the ideal picture of the monkeys.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Restaurant|Shinjuku: Hooters, Shinjuku|3| “Hooters are the same around the world”|review_365996598|I went to Hooters while visiting Shinjuku, because I was missing a slice of Americana after living in Taiwan for the past 1 and 1/2 years. Overall, Hooters in Japan is no different than Hooters in America. The girls were very sweet and pretty, but spoke broken English. It made it hard at times to communicate your order. Otherwise, pretty much a standard Hooters around the world. If you are looking for this, then I would suggest going. If you are in Japan, to experience Japan's uniqueness, I would suggest visiting somewhere else to eat.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park: Black Canyon|4| “Not quite as impressive as Bryce Canyon”|review_362777316|I read a title of an earlier review where a man said skip if you have been to the Grand Canyon or Canyonlands. I think that is a good summation of the Black Canyon. The Canyon itself is beautiful and offers many gorgeous views. If you live in Colorado, I would suggest visiting. However, if I had to pick only one canyon to visit, I would pick Bryce Canyon in Utah over the Black Canyon. Nevertheless, if you love national parks and hiking, the Black Canyon will not disappoint in that aspect.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Taito: Toshogu Shrine|4| “Beautiful and a must see in the park”|review_344908963|The Toshogu Shrine is located next to the Ueno Zoo. It is a beautiful little shrine and a quiet sanctuary in the metropolis of Tokyo. Unfortunately, I only spent a short amount of time in Ueno Park. If I were ever to return to Tokyo, I would highly suggest visiting Ueno Park and the nearby temples and shrines. They provide peace and quiet in what is an otherwise chaotic city.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Yokohama: Soji-ji Temple|4| “Amazing Surprise”|review_343750686|Soji-Ji Temple is huge. The area consists of 5 to 6 different buildings. I came upon the temple by accident when exploring the area close to my hotel. The temple felt more appropriate for a place like Kyoto than Yokohama. If you are to visit Yokohama, I would highly suggest seeing the temple. It allows you to see a more traditional and relaxing side to Japan as well.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Nantou County: Xitou Nature Eduction Area|5| “Felt Like I Was in Return of the Jedi”|review_334199914|I felt like I was in the forest from Return of the Jedi. I have never seen such a beautiful forest before. I felt like I could spend hours exploring Sitou. As a previous reviewer noted, there were a lot of elderly Taiwanese walking in the park. If you stick to the main road, it is a relatively relaxing hike with all the aforementioned elderly Taiwanese. If you travel on one of the hiking trails, there is a good chance you can be one of the few people on the hiking trail. Please be careful on these trails though, as the stairs are uneven. Overall though, I would highly suggest traveling to Sitou.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Hotel|Taichung: The Sun Hot Spring Resort|2| “Not What I was Expecting”|review_328303116|I booked the hotel's "Honeymoon Suite" as a romantic weekend getaway for my girlfriend's birthday. The hotel's website led me to believe that the hotel was of a much higher quality than when I arrived. On the website, the Honeymoon Suite appeared to be a large luxury room. Instead, upon arriving, the room was tiny. It did come with a small hot spring in the bathroom. However, for the price of 4400 NTD, I felt like I did not get what I paid for. I would suggest looking for other hot spring hotels if you are looking for a romantic weekend away. Unfortunately, The Sun Hot Spring Resort did not meet my expectations.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Osaka: Kuchu Teien Observatory|3| “Beautiful Sunset”|review_326596550|Living in Asia, I am spoiled by the many different views of Asia's skylines from impressive skyscrapers. I visited Osaka's Floating Garden twice. The second time visiting was more impressive, because I went during sunset. Watching the sunset from the top of the Floating Garden over all of Osaka was amazing. However, I feel like if I visited the building not during sunset, the view would be not much to brag home about, but instead just another Asian skyscraper with a view of the city.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Nantou County: Cingjing Veterans Farm|4| “Another Surprise from Taiwan”|review_323594449|When visiting the farm, I had already lived in Taiwan for over 2 years. At this point, I honestly felt like I had seen almost everything there was to see in Taiwan. Cingjing Veterans Farm surprised me. I was mainly surprised because of the surrounding landscape. The area was absolutely beautiful. The high mountains of Nantou are vastly different from the subtropical and tropical plains of Taiwan's coastal areas. I would highly suggest visiting the farms if you live in Taiwan and are looking for an escape from the heat.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Tainan: National Museum of Taiwan History|4| “Pleasant surprise”|review_317439067|I was pleasantly surprised by the National Museum of Taiwan History. I went to the museum not expecting much. Instead, I left the museum with a very educational experience. For such a small island, Taiwan has had a turbulent history. Caught in-between Japan and China, Taiwan has been fought over by both locations, given Taiwan a unique history: a history one could learn about at the museum.The museum also offered audio headsets in both Chinese and English.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Manitou Springs: Manitou Springs Incline|5| “Earned my respect”|review_301573284|Words cannot do justice to how rigorous and challenging the Manitou Springs Incline is. After running cross country and track and field in high school, I devoted myself to a life of fitness. I still bike to work, weight lift on a daily basis and have become accustomed to passing people while hiking 14ers in Colorado. The Manitou Springs Incline was a challenge. Please do not underestimate how tough this can be. At the same time though, it is worth it. The sense of accomplishment you feel is well worth it. At times, you literally have to crawl to make it up the steps. Once you are at the top though, you have the realization that you can overcome almost anything.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Alma: Mt democrat alma colorado|5| “Climbed it twice”|review_297945482|I have hiked these mountains twice. Once as part of Ryan Frazier's Congressional Campaign. The second time with a church group. The first time I hiked just Mt. Democrat. The second time, I hiked 3 of the 4. My advice, pack plenty of warm weather clothes and water. I did not pack enough of the latter for my second journey up there and found I was unable to do the 4th 14er due to lack of supplies.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Richmond: Minoru Park|3| “Beautiful and complete park”|review_296459767|I stayed at a hotel in front of Minoru Park for two nights. I visited the park during my first night. The park reminds me a lot of the sports park by my apartment in Taiwan. The park is quite large and home to cricket fields, outdoor bowling, etc. I was very impressed by how much public space the park had.

After living in Asia, I quickly realized that tall buildings are everywhere here. Taipei has Taipei 101, Macau has Macau Tower, Osaka has the Sky Garden building, etc. Therefore, in many ways, the 85 Sky Tower is just another representation of this trend of constructing tall buildings. Yes, the 85 Sky Tower is cool and provides beautiful views of Kaohsiung. However, if you are in Taiwan and only have time to visit the top of one tall building, I would suggest Taipei 101 over the 85 Sky Tower.

Elephant Mountain overlooks Taipei 101 and can be reached from the Xiangshan MRT stop. Each time I have visited Elephant Mountain, it has been a strenuous workout. There are two main lookout points to view the 101. The first is by a large boulder with the Chinese character "shan" on it. This look out typically has a lot of people. The second look out has far less people, but does not offer as good of views of the 101 in my opinion.

Senado Square's architecture does not disappoint; reminding visitors of the Portuguese colonial period. There is just one drawback to the area; it is busy! At times, I felt it was nearly impossible to walk due to the abundance of people. The architecture is beautiful, but navigating the roads is borderline chaotic.

When I first saw the Gorge I was running a half-marathon. I nearly crashed into the runner in front of me, because I had not seen such a beautiful sight before. I was overcome with the crystal clear blue water and picturesque green cliffs. I could not imagine a more beautiful sight.
Kyle M|BF0FFF76BE438F454DB27B93BBF02676|Attractions|Taichung: Taichung Station|2| “Small and old like the previous post”|review_287124228|The train station is small, old, and honestly the only place in Taichung where I feel a little unsafe. The area is highly frequented by tons of people, but is super small and not maintained. It is hard to navigate with so many people at the train station. Make sure you purchase your train tickets ahead of time for wherever you plan on going. If you do not purchase tickets ahead of time, arrive at the train station at least 20 minutes before you plan on departing; otherwise, you might be late for your train due to the high number of people at the train station.

When I used to live in Denver and Aurora, Smash Burger was a frequently visited restaurant with both friends and family. I used to love getting both the guacamole chicken burger and sweet potato fries. Excellent restaurant quality food at a super fast speed.

The seat allotted to us was at extreme back don't know the reason for this.

Enjoyed the goose bumps slides like HUMAN, CYLON and MUMMY rides. Best among all was the TRANSFORMER ride, it was one of kind experience. Also light camera & action ride is good to get interim of cinematography. Sad part was long ques and waiting time for each ride suggest to go for express pass to enjoy all the rides in time. keep watch on show timings do not miss the water show it was thrilling to watch entire action in front of your eyes. lot of dining options yet very limited choices for vegetarian.

Hotel decor is modern yet elegant, like the stone sculpture in lobby and reception. Breakfast was truly lavish and palatable love the bircher muesli from b/f buffet. Hotel IRD menu feature with very limited choices of Indian dishes and those also available on the clock. Appreciate the front desk team for allowing us late c/o. Location of the hotel is another advantage as its in heart of orchard. Overall had very enjoyable stay, thank you team GHS.

I was their on Friday evening restaurant was pack at the peak dinner hours, manage to get the sitting inside the restaurant. Staff was polite and inform us their could be delay in food service due to high occupancy in the restaurant which is good thing to inform prior rather making customer wait on the table. Though the food was serve in less time what promised being Indian traveler i have perfect seance of Indian cuisine and to my satisfaction food stand to the perfection. Restaurant overlooking to the see is perfect place to spend the evening with wine and Kebab was unlucky to get the table on deck. If ur planning to come during weekend be their in early hours to get best table on the deck.

I was upgraded to a suite with several wall high glass windows facing the common area. The hotel is at a walking distance from Stanford University and the Stanford Shopping Center. Also found the breakfast spread (including made to order omelettes) to be pretty good.

I heard from one of the colleagues that they also have a few voice recognition enabled rooms (I didn't get one though). The hotel also offers a decent breakfast buffet (better than the club lounge of some of the other SPG properties).
cashish11|21340E15DB6C78393D725A13B9D965D4|Hotel|Milpitas: Sheraton San Jose Hotel|4| “Great staff and nice exteriors”|review_509961655|I stayed at this hotel for almost a month and was pleased to see that most of the front desk staff and the Sheraton club staff were able to recall my name (a rarity in large hotels). I had a balcony in my room with sweeping views of the monutains, which was another plus.I would recommend improving the food options (specially the vegetarian ones) in the lounge for both breakfast and evening snacks. Have been to Sheratons in the past which had better spread - specially in the evening.

The hotel is at a walking distance from the bus stand. The rooms are spacious and clean. Staff is courteous. However, the hotel doesn't feel like a 3 star - the towels in the bathroom had hardened and had a bluish tinge, probably due to multiple washes. The paint on the bathroom door was wearing off. We didn't use laundry facility, but was surprised to see that the laundry rates were pretty low - almost 1/10th of a typical 4 star hotel in Mumbai! We opted for a la carte breakfast - it's a little expensive but loved the food.

However, don't think the quality or the quantity of the food does justice to teh price they charge. The dining tables are placed pretty closed to each other, so on a crowded day, it would be almost like eating at a food court

The price was about $10.5, which is much more than what a comparable restaurant with such an ambience would cost in a place like this

The breakfast spread was also good, including a bunch of Indian dishes. Hotel also provides a 'handy' in everyroom, like most of the other IHG hotels in Singapore. However, that's where the good things about the hotel end. The rooms look really old and tired and need renovation. Even though bathrooms are big - and even have a bath tub, the old creeky feeling doesn't make you feel good about the overall experience.

It's a little far off from the main business district, so I only stayed here on a weekend. The hotel in its entirety, including the lobby, rooms and restaurant, has been beautifully designed to bring alive the memories of Peranakan tradition. For e.g rooms have a carrom board shaped table and a traditional cupboard with antique looking Chinaware. As an added bonus, there are several restaurants at a walking distance from the hotel

The hotel provides a 'handy' in everyroom, which allows free to calling to India, US and a few other countries + you can take it along with you outside, during your stay. The breakfast is limited (no made to order eggs / waffles).

Has pretty much everything I expect from a Westin - a decent lounge, big rooms with the 'Westin' decor and helpful staff. The infinity pool and the views of the sea from the lounge are added bonus
cashish11|21340E15DB6C78393D725A13B9D965D4|Hotel|Singapore: Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview|4| “Clean, renovated hotel by the river”|review_473711114|This hotel recently changed their name from Riverview to Four Points, hence majority of the taxi drivers don't seem to know about it (you need to tell them, it was formerly called Riverview). It's one of the better Four Points I've seen across continents. Mid-size but almost 'new' looking rooms, helpful staff and a decent breakfast spread (including made to order eggs). The hotel is price competitive compared to other chain hotels in Singapore, and also offers an on-premise self-service laundry service.

A case study on good to worst - from IFE to Loyalty Program”|review_473710499|Jet's story can be converted into a case study on how to take a premium airline from India and convert it into one of the worst among the lots. Their Jet Privilege Platinum tier used to allow members to take a guest with them to the lounge. Now, only the member can get in (so, you are going to leave your partner outside or pay for him / her). They publicize their relationship with Etihad at every possible opportunity - but Etihad treats their members as unwanted pest. Jet Platinum aren't usually recognized by Etihad staff (unless you push them and threaten to escalate). Jet Platinum don't get access to most of the Etihad's partner lounges - unbelievably that also includes the lounge in Bangalore - a city in Jet's home country! They have started cutting down on in-flight entertainment in the name of a new program called Jet Screen - a limited collection channel that you can access through WiFi in the plane on 'Your Own Device'. The catch - you need to download an app before the plane takes off (no one in the flight I took from Singapore to Bangalore, knew about the app and ended up looking at the Jet's IFE home screen for the 4.5 hours of flight.) Plus, you need to drain your phone's battery - imagine using your cell phone for watching movies on a long haul flight!!

Every single person (and special thanks to Stephanie) - right from checking in, smooth process of switching rooms due to separate reservations, to late check-out - the staff was extremely courteous and handled my requests exceptionally well.Of course - the hotel is very well maintained, the breakfast buffet spread is decent, and it's at a walking distance to several restaurants and at a short driving distance to Columbus Park Crossing mall. The hotel also offers free self-laundry service to guests.

They have also have a coin operated washer and dryer. Hotel is at a walking distance to shopping area and a few restaurants.The only area for improvement would be - maintenance of rooms. Some of the lamps in my room were broken or had missing bulbs.

However, the hotel needs to improve on its cleanliness. The area near the lifts and the lift themselves stink. Air fresheners installed in the lift don't help much.

It's right next to Chattahoochee river and is connected to the river walkway. It's proximity to Broadway restaurants and stores like Piggly Wiggly, and Whitewater express also adds to its advantage. The bar-coffee-shop -restaurant is also decent. It was under renovation for a few days when I was there, and during that period the hotel offered free breakfast buffet to all guests!Tip - Ask for a river facing room, else you'll be looking at the parking lot of a riverfront hotel :)

To my surprise, this hotel offers best of both the world. On one side you have deep dense rainforest and on the other is the endless blue water. We spotted more animals / insects here, than we did at Taman Negara. We even spotted monitor lizard swimming in the pool! It;s amazing how beautifully the hotel has maintained it's surroundings.The breakfast spread was also fantastic, with a really nice bakery section. The hotel is a bit disconnected from the rest of the world. So if you want to explore Langkawi, you'll have to rely on their shuttles, hotel taxi or rent a car.

It's kind of disconnected from the rest of the world, but that's exactly what we wanted from our trip to Taman Negara. The breakfast offered by the hotel restaurant is decent. Restaurant is a bit expensive, considering average meal prices in Malaysia, but the location makes it worth every bit.

Guests can also walk to the Ampang Park LRT station, using the foot over bridge, connected to the the intermark building. And the best part is, the hotel is at a walkable distance from Petrona towers.

However the ruins that you get access to by buying the tickets and standing in queue for hours are definitely NOT worth visiting.

When a hotel refuses to offer basic amenities like dental kits you know that the hotel is taking it's budget really seriously :)The location is not the best, as most of the people prefer to stay in the old town.

The lobby is grand and the rooms are well maintained. The breakfast spread was also decent.
cashish11|21340E15DB6C78393D725A13B9D965D4|Hotel|Frankfurt: Element Frankfurt Airport|3| “New SPG property close to the airport, but..”|review_379572803|First the good things:- It's a new property and rooms are very well maintained- The breakfast spread is better than one of the other Elements I stayed in, while travelling to the US- The hotel is close to the airport and is connected by public bus services- It's Starwood property and recognizes SPG status. I was upgraded to 1 bedroom suite every time I stayed hereNow the not so great things:- The hotel is in the middle of nowhere.. The nearest shopping mall is at the airport, which is definitely not at a walking distance- The hotel doesn't offer shuttle service, which almost every other hotel in the vicinity does (Staff did mention that they have plans to start it). The situation is worsened by the fact that cab drivers don't like ferrying people between airport to this place, because of such a short distance (They apparently need to wait for hours in the queue at the airport, and the typical fare between Element and the airport is around 10Euros)- The evening happy hours was pretty disappointing compared to other element and long stay properties of Hyatt and MariottAnd finally the worst things:- This hotel is always out of body lotion / moisturizer. This was the first time in my travel history that I had to actually buy moisturizer from outside, because hotel was always out of stock- The standard check-in time is 3 pm. I used my 'Your24' privilege and asked for check-in time of 11 am which was approved. However, my flight landed a little early and i reached the hotel around 9:30. My room was ready, but the receptionist asked me to pay the early check-in fee. Again this was a first in my travel history. I've been maintaining a platinum status with SPG and never had to pay for early check-in. In fact, even the chains where I don't have a status allow early check-in if a room is available. The worst part was, I already had an early check-in approval and still had to pay some silly 20 Euros. So much for spending tens of thousands of dollars at SPG properties.

The property is newly constructed and very well designed. We got a corner room, with ceiling length french windows on 2 sides, and an unobstructed view of a part of the lake! The room was very well decorated and is at par with most of the business hotels you would find in bigger cities. The only thing missing in the entire setting is an in-house restaurant. They order food on your behalf from a nearby restaurant (hilltop, if I'm not mistaken). The food quality is good, but suffers the expected effects of getting packed in steel foils. All in all, a really good hotel.

So, if you are feeling bored, you can just walk to the other side of the building to check out season's sale or catch a movie at the PVR. While the hotel lobby is relatively small for a hotel of its category, our room on the 7th floor was pretty spacious and very well decorated. Also loved the dinner buffet (we were there on the Christmas night and they had more than 15 varieties of cakes / pastries).

The lobby in the towers section - with its tall English windows, and dimly lit but beautifully decorated Cabinet lounge, appear as if they have time traveled from the Raj era to modern day India. Presence of massage chair in our suite, made our stay a bit more relaxing. Also loved the fact that coconut water (in breakfast buffet) isn't served in glass, but guess what - in actual coconuts :P

The facade of this hotel is as impressive as its interiors. The design of the entire hotel seems to be an attempt to recreate one of the grand palaces of the bygone era. Everything about this hotel is grand, right from the lobby to the suites (one of the 2 suites we booked, even had a dedicated study room!). The breakfast spread is impressive and so are the hotel staff members.

However, I went ahead as its one of the few reasonable SPG properties in Singapore and the hotel didn't disappoint me. The lobby is impressive and so is the artificial waterfall right behind the breakfast area. I had used my suite night award and was upgraded to suites. Each suite has a different theme (mostly European cities) and boasts of interiors inspired by that City. Would love to come back here.

And I must say each time I was so impressed.Some tricks you may wanna consider before going:Go on weekdays. Weekends are hell crowded and the queue time is about 120 min for each ride especially in the morning. You can simply buy the express pass, still facing lines but shorter.Be there at 10 AM to get the most out of it.Plan your day ahead, prioritize the rides you want to do the most as you will have short of time. My suggestions are Transformers, roller coaster (Cylon and Human), Revenge of the Mummy, Jurassic Park Rapids adventure. You can simply forget about Madagascar and Shrek 4D if you do not have enough time. But if you looking for something a bit relaxing, go for them.There are several shows during the day, not all are good but worth watching if you have time.The queues will be shorter in the evening. We got the chance to ride Cylon 3 times and Revenge of the Mummy 2. Food is of ver low quality and pricey! (I am not sure if eating will be a good idea at all before riding the high-speed rides!) Anyhow, that is the only thing you get to eat there. You can take some chocolate or granola bars or try some ice cream there (Ben & Jerry`s at Far Far Away) and then later eat dinner in Sentosa. (Chillis restaurant and some local food nearby). All the rides will be closed at 7 PM.Enjoy and have lots of fun.

Music is a bit disappointing. Be prepared for a big crowd as most of the view and the couches are reserved for the VIP or members and if lucky enough, you will get the chance to find a table to enjoy the view.

The hotel was quite near Taksim square, good access to transportation and city center, lively nights, wifi available with tea service. However, the hotel room was so small, a lil bit old but in good condition. The staff could not speak English properly. Not a luxury hotel but still fine.

The gorge trail was stunning with something new around every corner. We had the rim trail all to ourselves but there was really nothing to see other than a peaceful walk through the woods. It was getting a bit crowded by the time we left so I would definitely get there early if you want to beat the crowds.

The flight got delayed, finally got on the flight and sat for a while then they got us back off, waited some more, several more delays. Weather was totally clear. Finally, 3 hours after the original flight they announced it was rescheduled for 4 hours from then. I decided to just drive since there was no guarantee that that flight would make it. A refund was requested at the service desk but they said they could not since the flight was rescheduled and to call the airline. I called and they said they couldn't because I had been re-issued a valid ticket. Finally I got someone who could fix it as a "one time courtesy." While I waited for the delayed flight two other flights left for Boston on time, one from this airline, same plane. Not that I want to ruin everyone's flight but if you have passengers waiting you would think it would make sense to put them on the next available plane heading that way. Flight 2: Another round-trip flight from Rochester to Boston. This flight was close to on-time but the gate was changed several times at both airports and I was glad to have the app on my phone because it was not being announced, particularly in Boston you would be sitting at the gate and notice that the screen showing departures was off. At boarding less than 1/4 of the people where there and we had to ask them to make an announcement. Once on the plane on both flight they asked people in the front of the plane to move to fill all of the seats in the back of the plane. We had upgraded seats in the front of the plane but they made us split up and move to the back to fill the seats for safety. Weird practice that I have never experienced before. All the planes were old with very narrow seats.

The meals were Asian fare and pretty good. Between meals they were pretty quick to collect trays and turn down the lights. Before the second full meal they passed out warm towels to freshen up. The snack was some bread with a piece of turkey and cheese and some trail mix snack. The entertainment selection was good, plenty to pick from. The stewardesses were all bilingual and helpful. At the airport they took their time to make sure everyone knew where they were going and how to get there. They were totally fine with stretching in the walkway on the long flight as long as you were quiet and sat during food service. The seats were airplane seats, so not a tone of rooms, as expected, but they were comfortable compared to most planes and had fully adjustable headrests, no neck pillow needed. I would definitely fly with them again.

The staff was friendly and accommodating in letting us have hot water to make our own tea, instead of the pre-made they were offering. I would gladly fly with the company again but hopefully on a newer airplane. In both transatlantic flights the seats had no padding, felt like you were sitting on a board, the heard rests were not adjustable and the tray table was so low that my husband (6 ft 5 in) couldn't put it down over his knees. It was also a little frustrating that although one flight was an overnight flight they didn't serve food until halfway through the flight and never turned the lights down.

Nice balcony seating. You basically can get any combination you can think of. The pepperoni ball appetizer was not great, kinda burnt. I got an arugula salad with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and a spicy pork meatball on top...delicious! Everyone seemed to like their food. I did think the portions were a little small for the money.

I got ginger chicken which had a great array of fresh vegetables all perfectly cooked. The salad and soup that came with it were nice too. For the area I thought the pries were reasonable.
Tish Z|DCB8CB332E816F956B6D7A8FE0DC3D41|Hotel|Jerantut: Han Rainforest Resort|3| “Superior room pretty average, food just ok”|review_477580141|We stayed here as part of our tour package. We chose this upgrade because it was the only option that guaranteed internet. They did have internet but only in the common areas. If you are close enough you might get luck and have it in your room but we did not. There is a shuttle that runs often to the water for tours, although it is a safe walk as well, although fully exposed to the sun. We had a private superior room. The only rooms that were available had two twin size beds and the beds slide very easy so pushing them together was just asking for trouble. The resort has a small convenience shop with snacks, packaged ice cream, flashlights, ponchos, umbrellas and such. They also have many maps and tourism brochures. The grounds are great, lots of interesting things to look at, a stream running through and a hanging bridge to practice for your canopy walk. Most of the staff did not speak English, including the women in the dinning area and none of the food was labeled so good luck with food allergies. The place was supposedly remodeled after a flood only a couple years ago but it was not done terrible well. It was clean, reasonably quiet, dry and the AC worked well but we had cracked tiles and most of the grout was missing. The food was edible not great. The juice tasted like Kool-Aid but the banana bread and orange slices were good.

The hike is a bit intense in the heat. We started around 2:30PM. The trail is pretty steep but the view is amazing! This was so worth it! A couple things to note are that the National Guard do supervise and patrol this site, it is normal and you must sign in and out with them. They will stop you if you have a drone since they are illegal in national parks. There is a bathroom/shower at the bottom so enjoy. the first lookout is the hardest and after that the trail is a little easier. Find a clear day and do it.

The spring rolls were definitely the most unique I have seen. They were served in a fried glass noodle basket and had fresh glass noodles inside. The staff were very nice and the bathrooms were some of the nicest and cleanest we saw on our trip. The view of the beach is a bit obscured but it is very pretty. My only complaint, which was out of their control, is that there were shrieking children running around just outside for a good portion of our meal.
Tish Z|DCB8CB332E816F956B6D7A8FE0DC3D41|Restaurant|Rochester: Coco Garden|5| “Great food, authentic taste”|review_473685029|Great food, authentic taste. Went here a week after coming back from Malaysia. Been twice now and we will definitely be back. The only dish I wouldn't order again was the basil chicken, not bad just not as good as the other stuff. Roti canai is great with nice pieces of tender meat in the curry. The beef rendang is probably my favorite, nice kick but not too spicy. The house special pork has great flavor and melts in your mouth (it is pork belly and very fatty but if you've never had it give it a try). Coconut rice is wonderful.

Putu Bambu had these fun hot rice rolls that were a lot of fun and tasty. There are lots of fruit vendors. Just ask an they will open the mangosteens (mango strawberry flavor, best fruit ever, but not available in my country) for you. Inside there are many shops with imported and local goods and more food, but not nearly as good. Don't waste your time at the food court unless you are just going for the AC. They have a foot spa where fish nibble your feet among other odd shops.

Cannibal sandwich was good, beef was good, pasta was fine, the beer chicken was so bad that it got sent back and the chocolate sauce on the Belgian waffle was inedible. The location was pretty and the food was pricey but not horrible for the location. They would not do split checks.

Right between the train/bus depot and the Central Market and Chinatown. So easy to run across the st (although crossing is tricky with the traffic) and grab a great bite to eat from the st vendors. Do not waste your time or money on the hotel breakfast, it was poor. Much better price and quality across the st. The internet was poor at best. Kept disconnecting and was almost unusable. The staff was friendly and had good English. The beds were better than the rest of the hotels on our trip. We stayed one night in a regular room and one in a Jacuzzi suite. The suite was awesome with a great view (room 413). The regular room bathroom was frustrating because when you take a shower the floor is all at the same level so the entire bathroom floor gets full of water. No safe in the standard room and no fridge, but there is bottled water. No wash clothes or hand towels in the standard room. Overall the place was clean, reasonable and the location could not be better.

The room was decent, pretty spacious but could use some maintenance. There were only 4 guest staying there during our stay but we got a room with the picture by the bed torn off the wall and a semi broken chair. The climate control works well but when you leave it turns off and every time you come back the room is a sauna. The bathroom had a half wall for the shower so when you shower the toilet gets quite wet (close it and don't leave you towel or clothes there). Linens were fine but a bit worn. There was a built-in rooster alarm clock. The location is nice being on a beach (although not a swimming beach) and between Krabitown and Ao Nang but not a walkable area. We got a scooter and it was great. We booked all our tours in town. The Asian breakfast is phenomenal (best fried rice we had in the country) and all made to order, but that does take time. We had dinner there the first night and that was reasonable and pretty good too (green curry was good, chicken satay was a little dry). One day we had an early tour and hadn't finished our breakfast when the bus got there so they ran and packed it up and sent it with us. The wifi was quite slow. The pool was clean and nice. You can walk on the beach but the dogs will pester you and the area is not very developed.

Decor was tasteful and the location was perfect, close to Chinatown, the city center and the train and bus lines to easily get you anywhere else. Cute little pool with a random window in one corner that looks all the way down to the st. The breakfast was decent and varied from day to day with both Asian and European options but the food tended to be a bit cold. The bed was a bit hard. The climate control worked nicely. My biggest complaint would be our check-in. There was only one person in front of us but they did not have a reservation and it took nearly 15 minutes for them to get to us. Our check-in took less than a minute. The staff was friendly, had helpful knowledge. Everything was clean and toiletries were provided for everything including a shaving kit with shaving cream. The linens were great quality and there were washcloths. It wasn't silent but pretty quiet at night. I would recommend this place. Handy phone was extremely slow but nice to have.

I had the fall veggie tacos and my husband had the gobleritto, both fall specials. Weird I know! the dips were good, my tacos were interesting but worked and all the veggies were nice. The Spanish rice was good but I didn't care for the black beans (and I will eat them straight from a can). My husband liked his gobleritto, filled with turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, etc and topped with gravy and he ate the whole thing but I was not a fan of the combo. The place wasn't quite but quite enough to hold a conversation with a few people.

Being able to add protein to rad na was a nice, usual option. You get to choose the number for the spice level you would like for your dish which makes most any dish perfect for anyone instead of seeking out the hot or mild dishes. The staff was friendly and had no problem explaining the dishes (I do wish the menu had a bit more detail). My dish was full of well cooked fresh vegetables and was delicious.

The big thing this place is the crispy edges on their crepe like pancakes/hot cakes. the crisp is nice but the flavor wasn't there for me, needed the condiments and berries and was a tad greasy. We got there around 9:30 on Sat and there was quite a line and it seemed to be a little chaotic. Service was ok but it took several of us to interpret and correct our bill at the end.

Fireworks at Penghu in July-A nice place”|review_423442980|How: by air via Songshan AirportWhy: Fireworks at PenghuMy flight was in the evening so after checking in, I had enough time to hang out around Songshan Airport 松山機場. The airport is accessible by MRT and International and Domestic terminal is in the same building.Arrived at Makong Airport after a short 50 minutes ride! The firework lasted 15 minutes … . The girls behind me said these fireworks were much better than at Taipei 101 during new years.On the map, Penghu has about 5 larger islands and many smaller ones. The three largest ones are connected by bridges whereas other require planes or ferries to get to. However, the public transport isn’t the best in Penghu and adding to the fact that not many attractions are located in a cluster .. makes it a bit hard for travelers without their own vehicles to see everything. I joined a tour from the hostel (which was our hostel owner taking his car and driving us to places) … it was 600 NT for the entire day, which wasn’t too bad.Alternatively, one can take a public bus from Magong City to Siyu Lighthouse at the end of Siyu Island and pick certain attractions to get off and visit (this was what another girl in the hostel did).The bridge connects Baisha Island to Siyu Island 白沙鄉 與 西嶼鄉 and it spans 2494 meters long. It was built in 1970s due to the difficulties that people faced when going between the two islands (use to be by boats but waves are quite rough; during large wind, it can be quite deadly).We went to another beach after the sunset called Shihli Beach 山水沙灘. It quite a romantic spot because there’s barely any light and the sand was quite nice. Outside of the beach are a few minsu as well as food stands.For dinner, we headed to Magong downtown and ate at 馬路益燒肉飯. It is most famous for their roasted pork rice. Magong’s downtown is also home to their old streets, their earliest commercial village. A lot of the architectural styles on the old streets are from Ming and Qing dynasty and they currently serve as souvenir stores and restaurants, while others are western cafes.

If you go on Youtube you can find videos of people filming the boat ride. You can hear everyone in the background of the video puking. The waves are supposed to be crazy and the motion sickness is real. Needless to say, the boat ride was really fun and interesting for me since I don’t get motion sickness!

The park is smaller than Universal Osaka and whilst Disney HK is magical this park is very well organized. Our longest queue was 40 mins which is unheard of at this type of park. We had a brilliant day!

The setting is fabulous and feels Bali like. The rooms were spacious and clean and staff at check in were very helpful as we arrived early and organized our rooms quickly. Breakfast offering was excellent. Great pool for the kids.Having stayed at other Sofitel'a this hotel was a let down though as we had to pass on the following feedback at checkout:- loose tiles in shower in both rooms- beds made but not changed during 4 night stay- a/c not working, set to 18c but room was still warm- very poor service in breakfast buffet, day 1 they couldn't clear our plates quick enough and felt as though we weren't welcome and then on other mornings everything was left, in an open air space there were birds hovering for food which was not ideal!- had phoned to organise extra beds but was not on reservation and was then charged approx $150 per bed per night extra. To be expected but not necessary when there were some fundamental flaws Location is a little out of the action so we would either stay at Resort World or probably W which has a number of eateries adjacent the marina. Will probably avoid Sofitel / Accor in future.

Hotel was faultless and being relatively new everything was clean and in great condition. My mother was unwell during the stay and they organized a Doctor and even asked how she was on check out. Very impressed and would encourage us to stay at IHG hotel again.

The villas are huge in size and very modern. Daily cleaning service was very welcome and made it feel like a hotel stay but with all the home extras. Pool facilities for kids were first class. Buffet breakfast was not cheap so would recommend buying food in and eating on the balcony in the villa.

Outside the grassy area is perfect for the kids to play. Whilst some renovations have taken place the furniture is outdated but as presumably a private owned apartment this was ok given the spaciousness on offer.Downside was the mustyiness in the two back bedrooms, I would be amazed if it had not been noticed as it definatley needs addressing. A shame that wifi was not available as part of the package too, the rates are not cheap and in 2015 it should be offered as standard as it is if I buy a coffee down the street in a cafe.Would we stay again? Possibly, but would definatley shop around first and need convincing.

The service was friendly until the very end when they constantly pushed us to rate them 5 star on trip advisor.
Gas-O89|2534F18499E59D970A5131027E5D5B11|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|3| “A fun small park with poor maintanence”|review_473518349|My partner and I have visited many other Universal Studios parks around the world and wanted to give this one a go while on our honeymoon. The park itself is surprisingly small and most of the themed lands merge in to one another. The ride selection was okay for a thrill seeker, but might be less so for young families. Most of the rides during our visit were open with the odd ride down for renovations which is completely understandable. One thing that was really noticeable though, especially when comparing the park to its US equivalents was that the park was poorly maintained. Most of the rides paint jobs were flaky and the theming and props looked like they had been through a hurricane. I really wasn't expecting this from such a new park and for me, it really showed the low level of commitment to maintain elements when comparing it to a Disney theme park.Would I come here again? Probably not. But if you're not really fussed about how a park is kept, and want a small handful of thrilling rides, go for it.
Gas-O89|2534F18499E59D970A5131027E5D5B11|Hotel|Sentosa Island: Sofitel Singapore Sentosa Resort & Spa|4| “Chic hotel with a wonderful pool”|review_473517246|My partner and I stayed here for the last stint of our honeymoon trip.The hotel is beautiful and is situated at one end of Sentosa island with fantastic links to Resorts World. They have a complimentary shuttle bus that runs every half an hour from 7am to 11pm to either the Universal Studios area or Vivo city which is a shopping district just over the bridge. For people wanting to access the city, you can get a cheap and short taxi ride which the concierge would happily arrange for you.The hotel distances itself from the touristy area and has a wonderful luxurious and chic feel. It feels like it's situated in a jungle with giant trees and gardens all around.The hotel is of a moderate size, and is laid out in a way that ensures all of the rooms are quiet and away from the main pool area.It has a great bar where they have a pianist in the evenings, a giant pool which was surprisingly quiet and a selection of tasty, but over priced restaurants. Wild peacocks roam the grounds which add a nice tropical feel to the place.During our stay, we had their most basic room, which was fantastic, it had an incredibly large bed and bathroom with its own lobby area. The hotel and the room is fashionably decorated with cute trinkets and styling and I couldn't fault the overall feel.The service we received was fantastic from the staff on concierge, bell, pool side, restaurant and cleaning. We were greeted with friendly and genuine service and advice about the area and how to get around was really appreciated. For someone who doesn't enjoy turn down service (who really is that lazy to plump their own cushions and pull back their bedding?) the evening staff handled everything in a very tasteful and non pretentious way. We especially enjoyed the evening treats and the complimentary water left in our room each evening. The only gripe we had with the entire stay is that our bathroom, and some small parts of the hotel weren't best maintained. This was in no way reflected by the cleanliness, as the hotel and poolside was immaculate, but our wardrobe had many loose and missing handles, and the tiling in the shower was so poorly done, it looked like it had been slapped on. I had multiple tiles come loose on a daily basis which I nearly cut my feet on while showering. The cold tap had a leak and would constantly cover the the sink area in a pool of water. The pool itself had a light fixture hanging out, which may or may not have been dangerous and one of the lobby toilet cubicles was missing a door handle. Whilst these may only be trivial things that certainly didn't ruin our visit, it was just a shame to see the lack of care that I would expect from a expensive and premium hotel.Would we stay there again? Absolutely.

But once inside, it is wonderful.My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights, and stayed in a normal double room. We were pleasantly surprised when we got to our room with both the size and the decor. The room had the biggest bed i've ever slept in, and it was so comfortably. The room included 2 bottles of complimentary water a day, which is great when you're not supposed to drink the tap water. The bathroom was large and featured a great rainfall type shower head. The hotel featured turn down service, and a selection of very tasty restaurants (or room service if you're feeling lazy). The complimentary spa was great and included a sauna and a very large jacuzzi. The space also included a dressing room, free shaving equipment, cold flannels, hair products and moisturisers and was always very quiet. Unfortunately the pool was under renovation, but we were offered the pool at a local hotel which we didn't end up using.

So as you can imagine, we were pretty excited to tick this off our list.The park itself is wonderful, and is very refreshing and different and breaks the same formula that the other parks use around the globe. The park is massive, and the paths really accommodate the giant crowds the place draws in. It has exclusive attractions that aren't seen anywhere else, and I would definitely recommend their version of 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and Roarin' Rapids.For a westener, being in China and dealing with the cultural differences was considerably challenging. We found the Chinese to be very loud, and very pushy. There is no concept of queueing and personal space. So be prepared to stand your ground and feel someone permanently touching you. There are also local residence in the queues selling knock off Minnie ears, which the locals snap up. I would say working with these challenges put a bit of a dampen on the whole experience, but If you go in knowing this is going to be the case, it shouldn't affect you as much. I also found it baffling that people would continuously throw their trash on the ground, even when they were standing right next to a bin. That being said, the cleaning crew are FANTASTIC, and are constantly sweeping the queue lines and the rest of the park, so it doesn't end up looking dirty for too long.The park has a great selection of attractions, multiple shows, character meet and greets and some really interesting and tasty sit down and fast food options. I would definitely recommend visiting 'Barbosa's Bounty' for some tasty, filling meals!As a new park, it is beautiful, but I do feel that it is missing a considerably amount of attractions. It does however have plenty of space for expansion, which is nice to see.

Depending on if you prefer Woody or Buzz, we really liked the theme for our side of the hotel.The hotel lobby was always quite busy and loud, but not once did that affect our stay or sleep. The room was themed incredibly well, and had lots of quirky detailed. Even when you turned the television on, a personalised splash screen welcomed you. The double bed was a good size and was very comfortable. There was two bottles of complimentary bottled water each day, which was handy when you're in a country where you can't drink from the tap. The bathroom was the only room it fell slightly short, and this was only down to its decor. If you've stayed in any Disney hotel before anywhere in the world, the bathrooms are always the same. A bizarre sized bath, a small shower and dated tiles. That being said, our room and bathroom was immaculate, I just felt the style of the bathroom has already dated, and that's a bit weird for a hotel that's only a year old.The concierge staff, bell hops and cleaners were all very friendly, and tried their hardest to accommodate us by speaking English. If you want to dash to the parks quickly, you can drop off your bags at the hotel before taking one of their quick free shuttle busses, which run every 5 minutes.

Tour guide was very helpful, and made sure we all knew exactly where to go and when to be back for pick up. Bit of a "bump" at the end of the day, however. We were picked up at the Zoo and taken back into the City, where we changed buses again to be taken back to our hotel. The bus driver had been smoking in the bus while waiting for us to arrive, and put these awful incense sticks in front of the air vents to try and "mask" the smell - which only made it worse. He then spent the entire trip back to Sentosa talking on his mobile phone - illegal in Australia, and dangerous for passengers. Disappointing end to an otherwise lovely day.

Very clean, and good, I suppose, for what is intended...somewhere to sleep between flights. However, the beds were rock hard; no pillows to sleep on - 3 wafer thin things that were supposed to be pillows- we ended up wadding up our coats and cardigans just to get some height. Tiny little bathroom - similar to what you find on a train or plane - I wouldn't want to be a larger person trying to use this bathroom!

Staff were extremely kind and helpful (even when under the pressure of the breakfast rush ) courteous and always smiling - no request was too hard, and even the little things, such as ringing to check on our bus when our booked tour was late in arriving for pick up- made our holiday that much nicer and easier. Speaking of breakfast, the array of choices catered to even the fussiest of eaters, and was wonderfully fresh and plentiful.....and none of this coffee from a pot or an urn...tea and coffee made fresh and brought to your table. The courtesy bus made getting around simple and stress free. Overall, a wonderful place to stay. Thank you.

The climate inside will refresh your mind and soul I guess with the plentiful supply of oxygen and the pleasant aroma of flowers.

Unlike many resorts where the rooms/suites are built too close to each other, this resort has the rooms spaced apart giving it an appearance and feel of a nice little village in the mountain. The rooms are camouflaged into the plantation, made of timber and roofing that looks weathered, it merges into the shades of the forest woods! The rooms are spacious and modern, and the room door opens to a deck that overlook the valley. The view from the deck is fantastic and resembles the images from fairy tales. The sunrise over the valley is spectacular, offer plenty of opportunities for photo ops. One can spend the whole day on the deck experiencing a different valley view every moment.The pathways looks really nice and it is indeed refreshing to take the walk around the resort. The coffee experience is worth commenting, it gives you a first-hand experience of coffee making, from plucking the coffee beans to roasting coffee beans for a sip of South Indian filter coffee.The resort also has a good spa and club, with plenty of space for sports/games. There are a lot of options to keep a group or family well entertained all day long.The food was a little let down and not worth the money spent on it. We went on a week day with lower occupancy, as per the resort about 30%. However I felt that the restaurant was not well staffed and had very limited options to offer and found them very reluctant. By Saturday morning, I found the restaurant waking up and the breakfast before we left much better than the lunch and dinner the previous day. The message is don’t book on a weekday, if you are a foodie, go during a weekend when they have buffet or when there is good occupancy.What stands out is the location and the resort architecture - a heaven for those who admire nature.

We spent 2 days at this resort and had a refreshing experience.The resort structure has a very unique architecture, that leaves you spell bound. Wonder why we force ourselves to suffocate inside concrete structures in our daily life, when we can make such marvelous and comfortable mud houses, using raw materials right from our backyard. Kudos to the developers of this resort.We stayed at the earth rooms. The rooms are very spacious, comfortable and clean. The mud walls has a positive effect and probably kept the room very comfortable all day. The earth rooms are in the main building. The suites and the villas are spread out around the resort amidst the lush green vegetation, with lot of tall trees. All rooms are a few steps away from the restaurant, spacious and well designed. Food is amazing! Authentic kerala dishes, in its true form – simplicity. Have seen many restaurants making the food too sophisticated in the name of authenticity, however Banasura team has done justice to the dishes making us feel at home. The spread is not lavish, however the Chef has found the right balance. Great judgment.There are enough activities around the resort for those who love nature. If you are booked into the villas or log huts or suites, you could just relax in the verandahs for hours together - keep ordering the tea from the restaurant. The resort has plantations in the surroundings and one can casually walk around the coffee and tea plantations. The guide, extremely helpful, would come along if you want. The walk down the tea plantations takes you to a mountain stream. A good picnic spot. Need to figure out picnicking in my next trip.A 10 minute walk in another direction from the resort takes you to an absolutely great water falls. A great photo opportunity. There is a natural cave close by to explore as well.The resort had arranged a New Year party for the guests hosted by professional musicians. Great songs and instrumentals. The resort staff is absolutely great! They connect really well with the guests and has been helpful throughout our stay. Thanks to Banasura team for making us feel at home.I am looking forward to visit Banasura hill resort again.

So food would become easy.Buffet breakfast spread was the show stealer. We survived only on it, as Singapore in itself is a food havoc for vegetarians.Good hospitality. Rooms were tidied up daily. Bath tub was our relaxing moment after a long tiring day of walking vast stretches. We were attended to with medical aid even at 1.00am.

The best hospitality i have come across among-st all my visits to various places. Right from the "didis" who clean up the rooms, to the helpers at the dining area, they treat u good. Mr.alaa at the dining sector was salman khan for our trip. his unique style of walk, talk n the gesture to the guests:))Stay: if you very particular, the C sector of rooms are neatly done with wood framework and room heaters and all.. The B sector of rooms are also pretty decent without heaters, but not much of a trouble. Hot water available during all day.We visited during April end-May 1st week, 2013 at B sector of the rooms. Lovely landscapic view of the great snow laden Himalayas from the window. It was so beautiful n mesmerising to start the day.It is maintained n taken care from generations of the same family, who grow their own vegetables within d premises.Food-Pure veg restaurant.Being the end of winter..we were served hot green teas; loved the Mexican baked bean BF, puri sabji, pizzas, dinner buffet.Good collection at the library, with wifi.Thankyou Mr. Dawaa, his younger siblings (sorry forgot ur names: Tansen n phuchen). for having taken good care of our stay, visit n d transport..For making our trip a memorable one.How can i forget to mention the two cutie pies (Skarma n lexon); the future of the generation; toddlers but smart enough to knock u off ur talks n pranks.:PIt is 15 minute away from the main market area, right adjacent to the famous Shanti Stupa, and in the street of the sunset point.Overall then I would strongly recommend the Oriental. It offers good value for money and a comfy stay with a view, all with a great family feel to it, despite being quite a large property.

Water park- We personally couldn cover this, so cant say much..But from what we saw and read , its definitely worth a visit2. Theme park- If you are adventurous, like amusement park rides, this is a place of your choice.Its huge. Family trip. If possible plan a 2 day trip at this attraction.Cover up as much as possible. A day for rides, second day for the water park. If so take the seasonal pass.The rides are spread out beautifully covering all age groups; at all levels, meaning train rides to the most complicated roller coasters.But i must definitely say, its built n designed beautifully. No motion sickness. All tat u experience is thrill, fun, excitement, and wat not.Search the map properly before your trip, plan well..Wat all u wanna cover, wat u don wanna miss out; esp if your trip is planned with a short time spanNot to miss out- sky screamer, Bizzaro, El toro, Nitro, Kingda, The dark knight....Start your day early. This place tends to be crowded with school trips and all. Waiting lines for each ride can then go upto 1/2 hr- 1 hr..For vegans, not much option is available n its pretty expensive..dont forget to carry some packets along.Food is a prob thereStart your rides from the extremes (right/left) if u are early..Dont waste much time running around finding places.. Guides there to help you locate around easily. Even if u think twice on certain rides, just go for it..its worth an experience in a lifetime..At the end of it, ul not find it so scary or bad at all..It def requires guts.Certain rides or shows are closed due to maintenance or weather situations. Nevertheless, there is plenty to see and enjoy.3. Safari- If you travel on your own, dont miss the chance to drive by yourself.. Kids would love watchin all animals approaching your cars. If not the close tours, do take the chance of boarding the safari tour for an additional 10$.******Its fun to visit with family or friends..(group)***Carry light.***lockers available at 8/ 14 $ at the entrance. If not, certain rides provide Baggage shelves at the boarding point..Another optin is 1$ lockers for 120 min at the entrance of each park/ ride.**Its a public park sort of, so ul find al types of crowd..Jus enjoy ur trip.**For any queries before deciding on wat pass to take, chk online or ask the guest relations desk.**the attraction is not an cheap affair though!!**If you a visitor to US from diff country, there wud b an optin of tickets along wit the travel from ur city..Tat works out better. For ex. we travelled from newyork to 6flags at roundtrip cost of nearly 63$ per person..Wen the entry to the attraction itself comes upto 65-66$Enjoy your trip. Stay safe.

Hope the below info would be usefulhow to reach there -We took the early local train from Mumbai to Neral and from Neral we took a toy train to Matheran (which fits perfectly with the check-in time) so the toy train at the first look, looked very exciting and fun but after some time we felt it was terribly slow (you can book this thru IRCTC) infact we booked our return as well but since the toy train was v early in the morn, we cancelled it and instead walked from the hotel to the taxi point from where we were dropped to Neral (which was fun)about Matheran - am sure you would have heard it is a romantic, silent, peaceful place..well it is. but at the same time it is not more than a 2-3 day affair. One should take a horse ride (its fun, luckily we got a good guide, you can bargain and there are 6 points 12 points 24 points all look the same lol) initially we walked to different site points (take your shoes along) shopping - i wouldn't advise so basically it all boils down to the resort you are staying.about regal - after reaching the station we walked to the hotel (hardly 15 mins walk) check-in was easy and smooth. we booked the A/C cottage (beside the pool) perfect for a couple...activities in the resort - Pool: was v good well maintained, during the winter its fun taking a dip- badminton: i think this was the highlight of our stay, we both love playing baddy and we played 2 hours on both the days..during the night under lights :)- table-tennis: indoor activity to add on-carrom: do- foozball: now tht was a suprise :)overall whole host of activities to keep you busy. Food - when we reached the resort, we were very hungry and headed straight to the dining area and relished the food (pure VEG) altho the menu was different every meal still would like to see some new cuisines added.all in all a very nice stay :)Oh and i forgot to add one can get a good discount on the room tariff. i got one.

They didn't ask about the booking but we got a table anyway, so it didn't really matter. Was here with my two teenage sons, and the portion sizes were a little small for them, but fine for me. Super tasty, but we went else where for dessert to top them up.

It was absolutely incredible. I have travelled all over the world and this was one of the most impressive hotel rooms I have ever seen in my life. Although the hotel itself is an awkward walk from the rest of Crown, I quite like that. I stopped staying at Metropole as it was too busy and noisy with nightlife. This hotel is slightly separated with its own lobby bar so it's much better suited to business travellers. In room dining was always delivered right on time and valet is very quick as the cars are parked really close to the valet desk. Definitely be back.

Upon arrival you'll see a dated old building with lots of brick which made me fear the worst but he room I stayed in was good. Very clean and had been renovated at some stage recently. Beds are a bit like sleeping on a door but that's ok. I stayed in the rooms on the ground floor opposite reception and couldn't believe it that the window doesn't have a blind. Walking back to my room in the dark you could clearly see people in the shower. Although the windows are blurred, it's still a massive invasion of privacy. Staff are all great, restaurant was good too.

First and last! The staff in the bars and restaurant act like they can't stand their job and that customers are in the way. Nobody has urgency either. Room service took 1 hour 40 minutes to arrive and the waitress just said that they never received the order. Pay good money to have breakfast in the restaurant and you need to chase down the waitress just for a coffee, and the lipstick on my mug was a bonus. Rooms are basic but ok, showers have no doors so prepare for your bathroom to flood. Only reason I didn't give 1 star is because the gentlemen who valet park your car were incredibly professional. Anyway, back to the Playford.

The staff were great and the rooms were very spacious and clean. They're currently renovating the rooms but even the rooms that aren't renovated are great. The rooftop pool is just incredible, we went up every day and night and although t gets very crowded it's still worth it. One negative of the hotel is the time you spend in elevators is ridiculous and they aren't ventilated at all. To get to the pool could take 4-5 minutes in an elevator with all the stops and it gets that hot in them that it's horrible. Also strange why they've made it so difficult to get to and from the Gardens by the Bay. Otherwise, we had a great week and can't wait to go back.

I don't usually stay here but thought I'd try something new. Definitely my last stay. Very annoying with no parking, you have to use the Rundle Mall car park down the road and walk back down to the hotel. The room is obviously small and basic but that's expected for the brand. The bar and restaurant were good, had a rooftop bar feel about it and was very comfortable to spend some time at night. Overall, a clean modern hotel which is not practical if you have a car.

The hotel is quite old, they have done some minor updates to it but still feels very dated, especially the bathrooms. The one thing which was pretty cool was the bar area, very sophisticated.

The pet friendly room is that bad I walked straight out and just drove the second half of my trip without a break. It is best described as a concrete box. All tiled, no windows (all frosted with no way to look out). Why would anyone want to sleep in a closed up room with no windows to look out... disaster! Never again.

It has seriously gone down hill and not worth the premium prices they charge. When I checked in at 1am they said the hot water was out until 5am the next morning, 630 still no hot water and brown water coming out of the tap. I called reception and their response was 'if you want a shower go to the pool, we're doing maintenance'. Are you serious.. $220 a night and we have to shower in the pool area like it's a backpackers hostel. I guarantee they'll comment to this with excuses about maintenance but that's their problem, they need to deal with it. Also held a meeting of 30 people there in a conference room, all the signage was wrong directing them to the wrong room. Their response to this was slow and without me getting loud and angry they wouldn't of fixed it. Other than that the lipstick on my glass in the lobby bar, the terrible housekeeping where it's a matter of go back to your room and see what was done this time, not cleaning coffee cups, removing soap and not replacing with new. My carpark ticket didn't work and had to return to reception 3 times one morning to get out and the incompetent girl behind the desk blamed me even though the day before she was the one who was meant to validate it. Myself and my colleague thought the bar staff were outstanding but everyone else, especially reception is just bottom of the barrel in the industry. I'll be going back to Crown now. I come from a company of thousands of employees that travel globally and domestically, we have literally had this hotel removed from our approved hotel list. So in summary, if you want to spend top dollar at a hotel that finds all of this acceptable, this is the place to go. Frustrating week!

Rooms are very modern and very clean, couldn't fault the room except for the dodgy shower head, the most unpleasant shower head I've ever experienced.. But the hotel is that amazing it's a minor detail. The coffee machine with free coffee capsules were great. All of the restaurants and bars were great. Staff at this hotel are great! Pool area and beach was really cool too. Lots of amazing beaches close by so it was well worth renting a car to see the sights. Cannot wait to come back, will never stay anywhere else in Hawaii.

The rooms were clean however I hate cane furniture, didn't think they were still in use. Check in was confusing since its in a demountable in the carpark away from the main building. But anyway I'll most likely stay here again on my next visit. The restaurant underneath was great too but I don't think they're affiliated.

The location is amazing, stairs take you from your lounge room straight onto Salamanca Square. Very modern rooms but they have left the feel of the old industrial building it was. The only odd thing was the big circle holes in the bathroom and toilet door. Why would anyone want big holes in the bathroom door so when you walk passed you can look straight in. Very uncomfortable when your sharing with another couple. Stupid idea.

The type of hotel that doesn't bug you too much while you're there but when you leave you don't want to rush back. The room itself is ok but the bathroom is very old and tired. The lifts are ridiculously old, I actually got stuck in one for a few minutes until it went up and down and stopped on a random level. Later that morning it was roped off and everyone had to drag their luggage up and down the stairs to the carpark. I can see other reviews with similar issues so I can't understand why they wouldn't just get it fixed.. properly. On a positive note, the staff are great, check in was easy and friendly and the bar staff were very good. Restaurant was good, reasonably priced too.

The staff at reception and restaurant were amazing. Consistently great service and I had a good experience with everyone. The hotel itself is very underwhelming. The mattress was thin and rock hard, there is no hot water (warm at best), rooms feel very boring and tired. Not sure if I'd stay here again, not all bad but a few frustrating things.

The rooms however are very clean. I must say though there are some basics that would make the rooms so much better, like new bedding, an ironing board that doesn't have a big rip in it and the super strong smell of chemical when I got there. I know some people enjoy these type of old motels where you can park at your door but they're not for me (it was booked for me).

The rooms are very modern and comfortable. It would of been good to have a restaurant or cafe underneath but it's so close to the Main Street it doesn't really matter.

Rooms are bright, clean and modern and always seem to be maintained well. Staff are great although checkin is surprisingly slow. Minor problem though. The ocean view rooms have an uninterrupted view of the beach which is great, a lot of buildings now look straight at another building but not this one. Besides the cockroaches on the balcony every night it was a fantastic stay and well most likely be staying here for future visits.

The accommodation is fine, rooms were clean and comfortable, biggest problem was no mini bar. Not even water! Very strange for a large venue like this. My problem is with the conference facilities. The lack of attention to detail was noticeable from day 1. I never once noticed any staff floating around to help. The rooms weren't refreshed properly in between sessions. They had rotating sessions and didn't replace the water glasses etc so the tables were just covered in stuff from the group before. The chairs in the conference rooms are terrible, feedback from all guests was the same, by the end of each session everyone was standing at the back of the room holding their backs. The dinners were foul, waited 2 hours between entree and main and our steaks were raw (not rare, raw). Pork belly was just chewy fatSuch a shame because it's in a beautiful part of Victoria, but I won't be going back unless I'm forced to. I would of given 1 star but the staff at reception and the bars were great.

The room was very clean and I was impressed with that however the massive lounge room with just a small old lounge and tiny tv was weird. Walls damaged and patched up badly. Lounge was so worn that it looked dirty. Checkin is difficult if you have a car. Parking is limited and you need to book a spot. None were available for me so I had to park in a 2 hour zone on the street for 2 days which isn't practical. The lady at reception in the morning was great, very friendly. Even though it was a bit depressing I would still recommend staying here or somewhere close by purely for the location. Very close to Salamanca markets and the nightlife was good also.

Rooms seem to be recently renovated and are quite modern and very clean. Very fast free wifi is available which is great. The motel has a bar and restaurant which is handy. Girls on the front des were great. Only minor negative was the horrible shower head which was way to low and one of those super water saving ones that act more like a Gerni. Overall great spot, easy parking and will definitely stay here again when in town.

I booked one of the renovated rooms and it was definitely worth it. I am always nervous staying in these roadside motels but I was very surprised. Very clean and comfortable. Linen and bedding was obviously new. I recommend paying the Amal amount extra for a renovated room as it is very good. The only small negative is the walls are paper thin and you can hear every word the room next door says. Even when they open their door it was enough to wake me up. Overall fantastic little motel, won't stay anywhere else when in town now.

The checkin staff were fantastic, very very friendly and helpful. This hotel however is not practical if you are driving as there is nowhere (legal) to park to checkin, no onsite parking. You have to park out the front, if you can find a spot, then checkin, then go and park in the separate parking structure next door and walk down an alley to the hotel. Then checking out is the same. Was down a dark alley to your car, drive out on the road and park, then take the keys back in. Wouldn't be a problem if you were catching a taxi but is enough for me to stay elsewhere. To much hassle after a day of traveling. The wifi prices are ridiculous and I wouldn't bother. Would be a great hotel for a family to stay in as the rooms are well equipped. But I will be going somewhere with easier parking next time.

It is a small country pub with 4 rooms on the side of it. The rooms surprised me, great modern rooms with everything you need. Very clean and maintained perfectly. Stayed here for 4 nights for work and they serviced the room daily. They could probably seal the doors better to stop the bugs flying in when the lights are on but that's pretty minor. The pub serves great food, the drinks are very expensive ($12 for a pint) but in such a small town to have this kind of quality, who cares how much it is. The only negative is how early the pub closes, and the staff make no effort to make you feel welcome after 9pm, they were pretty keen to get home and it was obvious. Also strange that they had very few beers to choose from, but the pale ale on tap was epic.

Breakfast buffet was great, very good quality food with a decent range. Dinner was good, not the best selection of food on the menu but what I ordered was great. Would of preferred some more simple food done really well. But the fancy chicken stuffed with 42 million things was great anyway. Overall great restaurant, can't go wrong with anything Crown.

The rooms have clearly been renovated as they're very modern and very clean. The bed was the best thing I have ever slept on... ever! Lots of easy parking, either $25 undercover or free outside. It is very confusing getting up to the hotel from the basement carpark and I found myself in the wrong building. A few guests that I met said the same thing. The restaurant was great, breakfast and dinner was beautiful. Also had a dinner in the Bistro in the main building which was great. All restaurants and bars are in the same complex which makes for a great stay. Overall fantastic hotel and I won't ever stay anywhere else in Perth!

The food is good and I have no problem with that. The staff however, omg they are terrible. You will experience the slowest most depressing service of your life. Usually you get seated and then ignored for 10 minutes while the depressed staff member slowly slides her feet to your table. Coffees usually arrive well after the meals. Don't waste your time with the bottomless coffee as you literally need to ask 3 times just to get a refill. Last time I asked 3 different staff for my refill then my waitress had a go at me for asking other staff. I explained to her it was because it had been 10 minutes since I asked her. There's heaps of breakfast options around so there's nothing amazing keeping me going back here. Maybe one day when they get better staff or at least a manager who is capable of bringing them into line, maybe then I'll give it another go.

We were given the first block thus having the great sea view and also the pool. The staffs there are friendly and helpful, though not everyone speaks English. The location is not so far from the busy Patong, approximately 20 minutes drive. Driving is easy as it's not my 1st in Phuket. It's not far to drive to the Big Buddha too. Dining is easy, you can either choose to have it in the resort or nearby Rawai beach area. If you wish to have a relaxing vacation, this is one you should rely on. We will sure be back.

Another staff to mention is Ms Linda at the front office -- she is not only friendly but also welcoming and professional, always see her patiently attending to us and other guests. The security are also helpful. It was so cold when we checked out this morning and they helped us with our luggage to the roadside, loaded our luggages into the taxi and till we drove off -- they were shivering!! but professionally helping us with smiles. Lastly, thanks to the GM who greeted us at breakfast and trying to help out with advice for our 2-day tour in hangzhou --- indeed very professional! Immediately next to Citadines, there is a huge mall with many F&Bs. We enjoyed the shopping and dinner here too.

Thanks to the management for providing this team of staffs whom provided us with a memorable vacation in Shanghai. From the airport pick up till the day we checked out, we've experienced a kinda service that we did not experience before.One to mention -- my niece fell very sick, 4 years old, an the staffs found out as we enquired at the front office for directions and they did not hesitate to provide my brother with all the support, care and attention. Their staff (Mr Anthony) even drove us to the hospital in his own car after he politely asked "do you mind taking my car and it is a small one" -- we have never experience such service in a foreign land.Apartment is huge and they have every thing you need in a home so everything is convenient. The room cleaners are polite and courteous and the receptionsts are always smiling when attending to us.

Yes it is slightly far away from the city and driving there is a bit of a pain but it is worth it. Parking is available and you can visit the small Afzal Khan site where Shivaji had killed him as well as the fort itself. Now, you will have to walk a lot and climb about 1,000 steps so be ready for that. The views above are amazing and better if it is a clear day although it will be hot then. You have refreshments so that might help out a bit. Do go and visit to see one of Shivaji's famous forts.

It was my first time and I did like the place.It is located inside Westgate mall and has a nice cosy atmosphere. They have indoor and oudoor seating options but I think outdoor is more preferable. They had some nice songs being played on the guitar and not very bright lighting.Service was decent though they forgot to get a couple of things like Ice.The food itself is good in quality but quantity is a bit confusing. Some portions are huge while some are quite small. I ordered for fish and chips which was good and decent amount but the squid and prawn mix was very small and I counted 4 small prawns.Slightly pricey so be careful of what you're ordering but qualitywise they are upto the mark.Since it was my wife's birthday, they made the extra effort of getting a pastry for us which was sweet of them . (We paid for it but atleast they got it). 3.5 /5 Stars
ankeet_sinha|E4DF5E77910752ED812205020AC79581|Attractions|Masai Mara National Reserve: Mara Triangle|4| “There should be a separate space for review of Maasai Mara only”|review_476758324|Firstly, Mara triangle is a part of Maasai Mara but it is on the southern east part of the park and a separate part. It is like a conservancy but if you pay for park fees at the main gate then you can enter here free of charge. If you are staying in Mara Serena then you need to be in the Mara triangle for which fees need to be paid at the Mara triangle entrance and not the Maasai Mara gate.What I cannot understand is why isnt there a separate space for us to review Maasai Mara area like Fig tree, Topi Plains, Keekorok area etc. This is the real Maasai Mara.Anyways, I will be giving my review for both,Maasai Mara is 4.5 hours drive away from Nairobi and along the way you can see the rift valley but thereafter the ride is too boring and nothing scenic. In fact the last 90 mins of the ride til the Sekenani gate is quite awful and even though they have fixed it, the road needs to be made into a gravel road instead of a dirt road. Its a shame that such a popular tourist destination is not doing this. At the time we came Keekorok and the main Maasai Mara seems to have many animals but Mara triangle was pretty barren. In fact we could see a lot of vehicles from there coming to Keekorok because they had heard of the game there. Both are about 90 mins drive away from each other. We saw the big 5 within 2 hours of our game drive. There was no leopard seen by anyone for the past two weeks but our driver Kim spotted the leopard first on a tree near Keekorok and we got an hour with the leopard exclusively. In fact, once we told the others about the leopard, that area got really crowded and on all the remaining game drives we saw the same leopard come back to the tree with a fresh kill as well as come down to drink water and then head back.We saw a black rhino and her cub too near the plains close to Keekorok and many elephants as well as some wild buffaloes, all three within 500 m of each other. We also saw about 25 lions in 3 separate places - one was a pride of 1 lion with about 10 lionesses and 7 cubs, 2 lionesses with 4 young male lions drinking water from the road that connects keekorok to mara triangle and 2 huge male lions near the Narok airstrip. We also saw couple of jackals and 10 hyenas on the last day. Many herbivores but a huge number near fig tree area. Unluckily we missed out on the cheetah although we tried so much but to no avail. They had all gone into the hills. I actually realized that it would be better to visit Maasai Mara in June or October as the animals are far more in number and if you dont want to spend four times the cost between July and September.The four stars I have given is because i feel Samburu game reserve is quite good as well and underrated as compared to Maasai Mara which seems to be dependent more on the wildebeest migration.I will definitely come back someday again but will be more careful about the month of visit.
ankeet_sinha|E4DF5E77910752ED812205020AC79581|Attractions|Masai Mara National Reserve: Mara River|4| “Must See”|review_476749914|Mara River flows between Maasai Mara Reserve and Mara Triangle. It is a 90 min drive from Keeorok and we left there on our half day game drive in a hope to see the legendary river and maybe spot animals on the way as well as go to a different part of the Mara. We went to the river accompanied by two rangers who were walking and got scared seeing a wild buffalo hiding in the bushes so they asked us for a ride and we obliged. They took us to the Mara river as a gratitude and we went almost to the Mara river where we saw so many hippos and crocodiles. Were lucky to see a huge crocodile trying to attack a baby hippo and the Mama hippo retaliated quite badly. We could figure out how awesome this place must be during migration. There is also a bridge from where you can view the river and we saw a couple more crocs lazing around there. Disappointed not to see any new animals on our way from Keekorok to the Mara river and back. We did see a giraffe bending to drink water, some nice birds, a couple of black backed jackals trying to cross the road and buffalos, elephants etc. On our way back though we came across a pride of 2 lionesses and 4 young lions drinking water from the road and then jumping across to the other side once they were done so we felt a bit better thereafter.

I decided to stay in Keekorok for the Easter weekend and boy was I happy. Its most important feature is the location. it is right in the middle of Maasai Mara and about 40 mins drive away from Sekenani gate. We saw four out of our Big Five (Lion, Leopard, Rhino, Elephant and Wild Buffalo) within a 5km radius of our lodge ! Lions were slightly far away yet we finished our Big 5 in our first game drive itself. Now about the hotel itself, Check in was quite swift and they take the money on arrival if you agree to pay at the hotel. We stayed at the Chalet rooms which were quite a good size and not very far away so did not have to walk a lot. The rooms itself were spacious, the beds comfy and a fan inside which provided relief from the heat. Also, the reception is quite quaint with a large gift shop and decent dining area. They serve tea and coffee an hour before and after breakfast, lunch and dinner. There is a nice swimming pool which is not too deep where families can swim together and also a hippo pool where you can walk and view the hippos and any other animals and birds if you get lucky. The property is not fenced so you can encounter wild animals coming to graze on the lawns. We thought the monkeys would be a problem but they were all near the hippo pool area although we did see on both days a Hippo coming to graze as early as 6:30 pm but the hotel were dealing with it well. In fact on one of the days the hippo was right behind our room and we could hear it grunt which was a different experience. The security helps to take you from the room to the dining area and back after dark.The food was quite good but the barbecue guys need to be a bit quick as there were long lines and food took time to be cooked. Also, on one occasion they ran out of fish and served us something quite inferior so they should take care of that. Good Indian food was available and the dal on all four occasions was out of this world. Only a couple of issues - there was no hot water kettle even though there was a base and we had to request several times before we got one between 3 rooms. They should sort that out. Wifi was quite bad and even mobile networks are pretty poor so for about 3 days we were cut off from the world.The glass on our room door was cracked so it could be an issue for someone staying there if it breaks. Also, there was no light between 12 and 4 am, 10am to 12pm and 4 to 6pm. Now I do understand that light cannot be given 24x7 but it nighttime is when fans etc are required so maybe they could change the timings to 8 to 12 pm and 3:30 to 6:30 pm when people are normaly out on game drives. A special mention to Manish the manager at the restaurant who did help us out and to Dominic at the reception who was wonderful on all the three days.

However stayed at Lobo only in 97 when we were there for 3 nights so for one night we made the move from seronera to lobo. Lots of rock hyraxes there and I remember the property being quite nice then with a nice viewing area from above the rocks where you can see the entire Serengeti and it was quite special. I hope they have maintained it. We saw lots of game from seronera to lobo and back but there was virtually nothing around Lobo then.Saw a cheetah sitting on the road and a huge black maned lion as well in the bushes at another point. The highlight was seeing 6 bat eared foxes which was quite special and in an age were mobiles were not invented and hardly any good cameras, we were never able to capture them properly.The wildlife lodge at Lobo is quite good and being in a different location (quite close to the Tanzania- Kenya border, it is a must visit if you are spending more than 2 nights in Serengeti.

The high point was the pathway where we walk below the sharks which was quite nice but thereafter it was disappointing. The entire tour just spiralled down. Couple of nice attractions like the colorful frogs, unique fishes, dolphins and the huge aquarium where you can see hammer head sharks, manta rays and schools of fishes. There were not turtles to be seen anywhere. They do give you a chance to touch starfish and sea cucumbers. I reduced 3 hours of my universal studios for this and the entire tour got over in 90 mins ! Their gift shop too is quite disappointing in terms of variety of products and their own personal branding is hardly to be seen.Avoid if you can and focus on universal only.
ankeet_sinha|E4DF5E77910752ED812205020AC79581|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|4| “Underwhelming but express pass is a must”|review_473312555|I have been to Disneyland Paris and now Universal Studios Singapore and must say it pales in comparison to Disneyland Paris. Not much to do if you are with young kids but it is not a bad place by any means.Couple of things - Get lots of water as I had heard you get water but not once did I find a spot. We bought a long sipper due to which we could get an liquid refilled at no charge as long as we had that sipper. Also, get a hat and raincoat since the weather is fickle. Also please get an express pass as it will save loads of time and enable you to do most rides. Since we had planned to go to the SEA aquarium, we left at 3 pm from there otherwise we would have done all rides. You also have the option of re entry on the same day as they stamp you before you leave. You also get baby prams on rent for SGD 15 which is a bit steep but it serves the purpose.The gift shop at the start is also quite decent, not as many options as Disney but you can get lot of stuff nevertheless. You can buy and they give you the option of picking it from a drop off point so use that option to avoid carrying luggage.Now for the park - it is shaped like a big circle. You can start from the left which is Madagascar and take the water ride as well as get yourself clicked with the cast of Madagascar and do the merry go round if you have a child (this is something which was easier to do as compared with Disney). Then you go to Far Far Away or the land of Shrek where you can do the Shrek 4D ride and the Puss in Boots Adventure Ride. While the Shrek 4D takes almsot an hour, it is not as impressive so avoid if you are short on time. Do the Puss in Boots ride though as it is different and quite good.Then move to Jurassic park for the roundabouts, the water adventure and the roller coaster - all of which are good. After that you go to the land of Pharaohs, Egypt which has a roller coaster and an adventure ride.The to the transformer section where you can do the really scary roller coaster and the Transformers 7D ride which is basically the best ride in the park. This is a must. Avoid getting clicked by the photographers who charge a bomb for their photos but if you must then there is a parade at 3 pm which is in the Sesame street section which is after the transformers section and there you can get yourself clicked and later on printed as well. The Sesame Street portion has diners and is covered with a skylight so you can relax there.A suggestion here is that get the map via google, explore all rides on youtube and then see which ones you want to do and do them first when you get there This will save time alongwith the Express pass which reduces waiting time by 30 mins. Beware though that some rides are not covered under express pass so waiting is a must for them.Have fun but if you have been to Disneyland Paris then dont expect it to be at the same level.

It made our entire trip so convenient. There is a Metro station at the end of it called as Farrer Park from where you can go to any part of the city. The mall itself has a supermarket, Mcdonalds, Dunkin Doughnuts and may other eateries including a chinese joint right on the top where I got to eat my fav roast duck with sticky rice.Shopping wise also it has lots to offer and we also purchased our sim cards from here as the ones at the airport were giving expensive schemes and the ones in the mall were more tourist friendly.

It is among one of the best things to do there. Yes, people do go there for the purpose of doing the cable car ride to Sentosa but Faber Peak in itself is so nice !The walk up to Faber Peak from Mt. Faber Park is exhilarating. A word of caution here though that dont walk to Mt. Faber and better to take a cab if you are old or with children. I am pretty fat but I was glad I made the walk although I was sweating profusely once we reached the top.Once you are at Faber Peak, do visit the toilets which have an amazing view of the CIty. Also, they have this Bell of Happiness where you can pose and it has some amazing views. What we liked though was the boundary bridge where bells were tied and you can purchase bells from the gift shop (2 for SGD 10) and write your wish on it and tie it. Since the Paris lovelock birdge closed down, this felt nice. The bells too are light so I dont foresee any problems there. Do go there and visit as it was something different and something which is not marketed well.

The iconic Merlion of Singapore sits there spewing water and so many landmarks can be captured with the Merlion in the background like the flyer, helix bridge, marina bay, marina bay sands etc, to name a few. Come in the day around 12 when it will be quite hot but people will be less so you can calmly pose with the Merlion. Dont forget to do the famous "Drinking from the Merlion" pose which many people forget.Also visit it in the twilight from where you can get a boat ride for around 25 SGD and visit the entire sights of Singapore as evening settles and day changes to night to get so many wonderful images.Also, the Merlion will start changing color and some iconic shots can be got if you are smart.Must visit.

I was able to collect my favorite figurines of Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock as well as lifesize figures of the three whee I could pose with them.Chinatown also has the most inexpensive souveneirs to offer so visit it if you are low on budget and you will get may many things even in 10-20 SGD.

There are many attractions like the birds of prey and birds of color shows as well as the various areas for posing with birds and the flamingoes and penguin areas. However the highlight is the Lorry Loft where you need to spend an hour atleast. They have so many colorful birds who fly and sit on you or try to peck at you. You get food for a very nominal price which you can offer and they come to you. I have a way with birds so they came to me even without food and I was lucky. Do this if you enjoy nature and they also have photographers who will click you and make the entire experience enjoyable.The only downside is the cost of printing of the photos which they should reduce as it is steep i.e 20 SGD per picture.

It has a skywalk as well which can be used and one of them has a hotel inside where you can go and view albeit you need to pay 10 singapore dollars (they will give you a complimentary drink in return though). What I would suggest is avoid that and go to the supertree grove skywalk especially in the night for the light and sound show which is at no charge and spend 30 mins there.
ankeet_sinha|E4DF5E77910752ED812205020AC79581|Attractions|Singapore: Singapore Flyer|5| “Great Views. (Top 3 things to do in Singapore)”|review_472900615|If you are in Singapore, then a visit to the Singapore Flyer is a must. The ride last 30 mins and the entire gondola (as they are called) is quite big and can accommodate 15 people atleast. if you are scared of heights, then maybe avoid but I would still ask you to go and sit in the middle of the seating area where you wont feel the height.The ride is expensive though (costs about 33 Singapore dollar per person) and the first 25% of the ride does not really have any interesting views except for the view of the ocean, part of the Singapore grand prix track and Gardens by the bay. It is only once Gardens by the Bay comes, that all the sights including, the Marina Bay, the Singapore Skyline, Merlion Park, Esplanade, Helix Bridge, Marina Bay etc. are viewed with a mind boggling views. Get yourself clicked as many times with these different views in the background. The one complaint I had though was the entire approach to actually finding the flyer is not very well designed and there should be many signboards. Also, the gift shops needs to have small models of the flyer to take back home and the staff in the gift shop could be a little more courteous.There is also the option of visiting it in the night and getting a different view of the same things with the lighting but due to the cost it might not justify going twice. Better to take a pic of the flyer from far when it is lit which itself is quite beautiful
ankeet_sinha|E4DF5E77910752ED812205020AC79581|Attractions|Singapore: Marina Bay|5| “One of the Best...”|review_472894832|So if you are in Singapore, The Marina Bay is basically a shopping mall with the world's most high end brand available. It also has a food mall and an internal river which tries to ape the Venice concept of the Gondola but ends up being very expensive so avoid that.The best part is when you arrive at the viewing area and can see the entire skyline with the Marina Bay Sands hotel behind you.Go during evening around 6 pm and stay till 8:30 pm, that way you can see the skyline and the city go from day to night and catch many stunning views in the backdrop while getting yourself clicked.They also have a sound and light show which is not as good as the one in Gardens by the Bay but if you have time then go. There is a lot of walking involved so get a pram if you are with a child and once on the viewing area - sit, relax, take in the sights and sound while savoring the experience of Singapore. All this at no charge since everything that you see and sit is free unless you want to purchase something from the shops or the food vendors nearby.

However, living in Kenya nothing beats watching animals in the wild rather than seeing them cooped up. Yes for those who want to see as many animals its is good but if you have less time then you can definitely ignore this attraction.

Yes it has the indoor waterfall and the skywalk but thats basically what there is to do. It costs more if you go to either dome so better to book both domes together to save some money.Do visit it but dont expect anything out of this world.

You can travel to all the attractions and go all over the small country using just the Metro. We used it for so many attractions and it was so convenient and friendly. The metro itself was very good and though they do have some old trains, they are still quite good. Just download the app or google the map and see the nearest attractions to every station and you can travel throughout.The only con is I felt it as slightly expensive and they should reduce the cost for tourists. Do visit it once just for the experience....
ankeet_sinha|E4DF5E77910752ED812205020AC79581|Attractions|Singapore: Gardens by the Bay|4| “One Time Watch (Dont miss the night show)”|review_472884835|Gardens by the Bay is a unique experience. I still wont rate it as the top thing to do in Singapore but it definitely is a part of the top 10. It gives you a visit into gardens and it has sort of improved on the botanical gardens concept. It has the flower dome and cloud dome with the flower dome serving as an exhibition for various types of flowers throughout the years. We were lucky to see cherry blossoms. Both the domes are air conditioned so it makes the entire experience quite pleasant. If you are with a child then you either carry a pram or rent out one which is quite cheap. The cloud dome is wonderful with the world's largest indoor waterfall and walking on the skywalk with the various sights of Singapore around is an interesting experience. You will spend 3 hours atleast there.One more thing which you should do is visit the light and sound show which is out of the world and better than one at Marina Bay. Be sure to be there by 7pm as there are two shows and they last 30 minutes each.Dont miss it

The place is very clean and nice greenery every where around. The food was quite good, could have been better but it was not really bad.The room I was staying in was quite good but the room service could have done a better job as they put only one toilet roll and when i came the toilet was not flushed.But the view and the design of the room was good. It has an AC and a fan so you can get respite from the outside heat quite quickly.The conference rooms though were quite sad and need to improve. The staff however were world class.We had an all inclusive drinks package so had lots of juices and sodas and a special mention for the Dennis, the person who attended to me and gave me my pizza for being amazing. Hope the management takes note of it.

ankeet_sinha|E4DF5E77910752ED812205020AC79581|Hotel|Singapore: PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road|4| “Quite good but the Indian origin staff need customer relationship training”|review_469801911|We visited Park Royal for 6 days and stayed there for our entire trip of Singapore. Now the hotel's biggest USP is its location. It is sandwiched nicely between city square mall which has virtually everything you want from foods, supermarkets and sim cards as a tourist and also the farrer park metro station. Behind it is little India and you can get all indian as well as Chinese cuisines as well as the famous 24hr mustafa centre which has basically everything but not at cheap costs.The hotel itself is quite decent. I would not call it grand but it is good enough at that price. It has a good gym and a decent swimming pool. They need to clean the swimming pool regularly though as we found fish thorns in the kiddies pool which is risky and i cut my finger on one of them which is how I discovered it. They seem to be short on staff or maybe they don't believe in having enough manpower. My daughter was throwing up one night and we called to ask about more towels and we were told the staff had had gone home and we could get it only at 7am next morning !!!There was one lady cleaning all rooms on one floor as well who poor thing was so tired. Now about the checkin and checkout. They are very strict about checkin times of 3pm and checkout of 12pm (but with a grace of 1 pm). Since we had a small child they gave us one room at 1:30 pm but during checkout we were told not beyond 1pm as they had guests coming and rooms would be full. But when i asked if there was an option of paying, i was told 25 SGD per hour so i guess there were no guests. These small things separate a hotel from being a 4 star to a 5 star rating. Now for one last thing which the hotel needs to address seriously. Their Indian origin front office staff are quite indifferent towards guests and even tend to border on being racist especially with us who were from India !!! The staff of oriental origin were so nice and good to us but the Indian staff treated us like second class citizens as if we were asking for their kidney everything we had a query or wanted some help. I have visited so many places but this was really surprising. Maybe the management needs to teach them some lessons on how to behave with guests who are not of white skin.

It is slightly out of the way on the old Mumbai-Pune highway so you might have to slip out of the expressway but at no charge so its a good option for lunch. It is open from 11 am to 11pm so food is available at all times in this slot. There is good options in the food from indian to chinese to seafood. The areas to sit are also very spacious and comfortable. Staff is courteous and food comes quite quickly. There are also lot of options in the area like astrologer, fish spa, camel rides, bird zoos and playgrounds. The only reason i have reduced a star is the location and price of food.

While I cant comment on the drinks as I have stopped but they seemed to be quite good at it and none of my colleagues really complained about it. The food however in terms of the starters were quite good. From the chicken wings to the cheesy garlic bread and mutton seekh kebabs, every starter was excellent. The main course however was a bit disappointing and never stood up to the quality of the starters.The place is expensive but if you have money and are in the mood for good starters and drinks then go ahead.

Even our 12 year old daughter found it interesting.The tour was a good start and gave some interesting facts. We watched blacksmithing and really enjoyed the 50 years of Playschool display (this is only there for a short time). There was a great play area in the café to entertain the 3 year old while we waited for our food (which did take quite a while and was a bit overpriced but yummy). The best part is the interactive play area where kids can dress up in old fashioned clothes and climb upon a big horse and a replica coach and play in an old store. There were lots of puzzles there for kids to do too - some that were tricky enough to occupy the older children. An hour and a half was enough time there though.,.... nice parks nearby to go and explore after that (Queens Park).

They went in everything between them. The older two were big enough to go on the rollercoasters by themselves which was great. Not too crowded (our school holidays but not theirs). The Lego shops were no cheaper than buying Lego on sale here but more variety. The food was very cheap inside (they inspect bags on the way in so you can't take anything in with you except water). Lots of different options for lunch and snacks.It was quite hot but there are lots of inside activities that are air conditioned too. Plan your day around this.You could do it in one day but there was enough to entertain us for 2 days and it was more relaxing!

The service was great. Parking was a bit overpriced but everything else was easy and pleasant. Lovely little bars and restaurants down by the canal make it a really pretty spot. It's also just a few minutes from the truly lovely Mauritzhaus We would certainly stay again.
mimipie2015|E9735DDE69BD031E73D6236F96C1C6FB|Attractions|Sentosa Island: Universal Studios Singapore|4| “GOOD family fun!”|review_473047972|Our young family enjoyed the studios a lot. It's such an easy trip from the city ($12 cab) Here are a few tips. Midweek crowds are much more manageable. Try to avoid the weekend crush. The express pass is a MUST with young kids. Even on a moderately busy day, the queues were from 30mins to 1.5hrs for the Transformers ride (which was excellent). The pass is not cheap, but it allows you to bypass the queues almost entirely. In the hot weather, this makes a huge difference to the day's enjoyment. We managed to go on all the rides we wanted (12 of them) and left with smiles. The pass is cheaper off-peak (early in morning, or after lunch) and can be bought in many places around the park. Bring spare clothes for little ones (some rides are wet, and there is a small water fountain play area). You can fill up water bottles around the place. The locker system is an annoyance for some of the larger roller coasters. You have to check your bags before you ride. On busy days there is a locker queue. It's free for 2.5 hours so it might be an idea to check your bags and do the two largest rollercoasters first (Sci Fi world and Mummy World).

I have a sore back and tend to need a massage after a journey. So far I usually rely on the spa in the hotel. This is almost always five star, and tends to cost a bit. Celestial Sanctuary was half the price and just as good. All the reviews on here are true. It really is professional, spotless and spacious. The therapists are friendly, unobtrusive and excellent. This place is just off Orchard Rd, up on the third floor of an office building. There was almost no traffic noise despite being so central. The products are amazing, and mysterious! What was the salt scrub that made my skin so soft??Take advantage of their happy hour price before 3pm. You won't regret it.
mimipie2015|E9735DDE69BD031E73D6236F96C1C6FB|Attractions|Kyoto: Haru Cooking Class|5| “Absolutely Great”|review_249057050|The best way to learn about Japanese home cooking is in a Japanese home. Especially with a super-friendly and diligent teacher like Taro, his lovely wife and sweet daughter. We all enjoyed the Kobe beef class on our four day trip to Kyoto. My husband Peter is talking about getting a special square pan to recreate the special 'Dashi Omelette'! The cooking class was informative and Taro was a golden source of knowledge. It was wonderful to get a sense of how Japanese people eat everyday and to be invited into the home of a local family. It was also lovely to meet our fellow chefs from Dallas and Paris. Best of all, our two young daughters (aged 5 and 6) liked lolling around in the living room, watching Disney movies and making friends with the adorable Haruko. Our children were made so welcome and enjoyed the 'down time' from sightseeing as much as we did. Highly recommended. Thank you Taro, Yoshiko and Haruko! (ps. Guys, I bought the soy sauce dispenser from Tokyo Hands as you suggested!).

Breakfast with the orangutans was great. The food was very good and it was very organised. We got some great photos. We then went for our elephant ride. This was the highlight for me and my girls. The zoo is undergoing a lot of changes and redevelopment. It should be finished by the end of 2017. I would go again but only if the new areas are finished. Down side was at the end of the day. We went to the photo booth by entrance/exit to discover that the photos were at the other booth which was a walk, bus ride and walk away. This was inconvenient. Also we were exhausted after spending the day outside in humidity which we are not used to and found draining.

Great Experience”|review_476643477|We stayed for 2 nights in a Swala room which was on the ground floor. Service of all staff was accomodating and friendly. We arrived early so they gave us another room, gave us the key and told us to roam the Safari Park until our room was ready - this was exactly what we were prepared to do.Being able to feed the ostriches and zebras from our room was definitely a highlight. The pool was lovely. My children were able to swim and watch the roaming animals. As the sun started setting we could hear the roars of the lions.Meals were by good with only large windows separating us from the lions.Being in "Africa" there were a lot of bugs in the bathroom. Just make sure you bring some insect repellant. I was also scared by a little frog who lives in the bathroom.The beds were comfortable. Good TV channels but the second night most channels seemed to lose reception. Wifi was ok - good for social media and basic emailing, not good if you needed to work.Amazing stay and will definitely come again.

I'm so glad they made me!!When caught public transport to the zoo. We caught a train and then a connecting bus. The bus ride was about 20-30 minutes long. I was nervous at one point that I got on the wrong bus.The zoo itself is amazing and I recommend paying a little extra to get the tram rides included. It's a large zoo so hopping on and off the tram makes the day a little less exhausting.Watching the animals, especially the monkeys was amazing. The animals seem to have a large, lush environment for them.A definite if going to Singapore

The breakfast experience was amazing. The sesame street characters took their time with all groups and their staff assisted in taking photos for us. An amazing experience.After breakfast, Universal officially opened so we started to explore. My children's favourite ride was the Elmo one. Universal was fine but I expected more. I've been to Disneyland a few times and felt that Disneyland was run much better than this Universal. They could do so much more. It was a good day out but I wouldn't rush back to Universal Singapore

The additional features of a shuttle bus and fire dancer were a nice bonus. Very affordable. Good service. Two minor complaints. It was a little bit off the beaten track so you need to take a taxi to get anywhere. Also the walls between the rooms are thin. If I was in the bathroom I could hear my neighbors.

The staff at the villa arranged a package through one of their tour operators When the small bus came in the morning to pick us up we found it jam packed with tourists it had no space for the four of us. The driver tried to squeeze us between other tourists causing great inconvenience to every one of us. This prompted us to cancel the package and go on our own.We hired a taxi and later hired a boat just for the four of us and found the cost of this independent adventure just about the same as the package. The package had restricted flexibility while we had unlimited flexibility on time and content It is necessary to negotiate the hiring charges of boat and taxi. You could get excellent bargain offers if you wait for all the tourist package to leave first.As for the coral snorkeling, it was let down. The sea in this area is littered with floating garbage used polythene wrappers,bottles etc. floating around you when you swim or snorkel. Sinkable garbage like metal cans,lids etc were also found embedded on the coral. The coral bed itself was not as impressive as I expected. Not like the scintillating underwater photography one often gets to watch in the media. For the first timers, though, the experience could be an eye opener if you want to know what snorkelling is all about. Although I have been swimming for over sixty five years and have swam in calm as well as turbulent seas and enjoyed it , I had never tried snorkeling and I found it nauseating breathing through my mouth in the debris ridden water. I discarded the snorkel and found it more comfortable to take long breaths and swim underwater to look at the coral . This is a better option for people who can hold their breath for a reasonable length of time .

I have never had the need to, for I live in the NCR. - but I would if, I had to, just for the Kashmiri Wazwan food they serve here.They serve other North Indian stuff also but I have never bothered to try them out.Every time I visit Delhi I make it a point to have my lunch here. The restaurant is invariably crowded at this time mostly with foreign tourists.The hotel is located near Delhi Gate between Connaught Place and the Red Fort land marks My favourites are tabak maaz, Rista , Gushtaba and Kashmiri kababs .

However the fresh meat and fish section and the dry fruit section in the hyper market was exceptionally large with a large selection of items generally not found in other malls. This mall is worth a visit if you are a keen shopper of meat - beef if you are particular - fish and dry food products. All other items should be available at other places at a much lower cost.It is also worth a visit if you have a lot of time with nothing to do.

The drive towards the Sholayar forest area was enjoyable although the twists and turns was uncomfortable. The walk towards the falls from the car park is a stiff climb over a small hillock and this could be a strain on senior citizens and less able bodied individuals.There are however several places beside the road where one can sit for short periods  Despite Kerala having had no rains during this period the water fall seemed to have enough water to make every one happy.
tjjohn|EA8271F8B12372C87BFE650BE4AD3B56|Attractions|Singapore: Night Safari|4| “Interesting concept”|review_475684178|Watching wild life in their time zone instead of our time zone is a novel concept. However there are many practical issues like lighting,proximity to the animals,safety etc. that need careful attention . The management has tried addressing all these issue in the best manner possible and have done a good job . With low key lighting the visibility is limited and there is nothing much one can see with any clarity . However the thrill of being in the presence of wild life in their domain was exciting. The commentary was good,informative and presented well but as expected the lighting was low key. Admirable for the animals and a strain on the human eyes. During the tram ride one may hop off at certain stations to take a walk in the jungle. We continued with the tram ride because we had come here as a family with members of different age groups.Able bodies individuals would find the walk more exciting than just the tram ride. We had a very short wait period when we entered the place at opening time but as we were leaving I noticed there was a surging crowd and a long queue at the entrance. Turn up early to avoid waiting in long queues Despite repeated requests by the tram conductor not to use flash photography there were many who continued to use flash with impunity. One would be well advised to switch off the flash on their cameras and mobile phones to avoid being a source of nuisance to both the animals as well as fellow tourists.

The sand was of black volcanic stock and the sea a shallow pool of water. No waves, no sound of rollers , the essentials that make a sea exciting. Swimming in the sea was safe but unexciting.We had taken a sea front villa that had sea facing rooms. The sight of fishing boats chugging around both during the day light hours as well as the night with bright lights was interesting  We engaged a boatman to take us for watching dolphins . He came to pick us up well before sunrise .Soon enough we joined a fleet of several other motorized out riggers loaded with tourists of all colors.A sharp shout from one of the boatman got every one scrambling towards him with motors revved up. The hitherto gentle boat ride suddenly turned in to a frantic chase towards a school of dolphins that had surfaced to breathe.The sight of these boats twisting and turning and swarming towards the school with tourists clicking away in a frenzy was more interesting and an interesting contrast to the gentle dolphins that continued to keep swimming.,apparently unmindful of the presence of these boats. It would be impossible to say whether these dolphins were amused by this human incursion into their territory. More likely not Surely there must be other ways of watching dolphins than chasing them down.

Expecting some authentic German food we went there one evening for dinner. We were disappointed. The food tasted more a Balinese version of German food .The restaurant was empty when we entered the place. We ordered and we could see the entire family cooking our meal. They took a long time getting the food ready while we waited patiently. The owner came over and we chatted for some time and finally when the food was served it was far from what we had expected. They also got our order mixed up but that was a minor issue that we could have over looked if the food has tasted German.This may not the best place to have German food in Singaraja

We spent about five hours here and could do just three events that lasted a total time of about 30 Mins.The rest was spent on standing in a queue awaiting our turn and searching for items of interest and eating in a restaurant. The Jurassic park theme was pretty good but the ride lasted just 6 minutes after a wait period of about 50 plus minutes. Madagascar also was good but fortunately the wait period was shorter. The question of whether the visit is worth the price is difficult to answer. All the themes are good. There are some that interests kids and some for teens and others for adults. Re- organizing the park with detailed information on the various themes and some brief summary of what can be seen or experienced plus a map of the park with directions and sign boards etc. and instructions would go a long way to help visitors to manage their time in the best possible manner inside the park, If these are already available they are obviously not available to every one. I was searching for the official website of Universal Studios for such information but could not find one. I could get only information provided by third party tour operators for this attraction.Paying extra for an express ticket to jump the queue was an option I was not very keen on. One jumps the queue encroaching the time from the standard ticket holder's time there by raising his/her time in the queue.An absorbing subject for a debate in ethics.

It was no different.I had a camera with me but I decided not to take any pictures of the bathers in the take.. The color of the water was not welcoming and so after spending some time in the area left to return to my villa.The street through one has to pass through to the hot springs was lined shops of all kinds. Kids as small as 6 year old were busy trying to sell their ware. Not an unusual phenomena for me but my own 6 year old grand daughter was amused and we let her bargain for a hand fan she fancied.

We had a meal as a family one evening and had no regrets. The food served was very good . We were seven members and ordered a variety of food. I ordered chicken cordon bleu and found it quite close to western standards. The Balanese food was superb.

This is one of a great way to see the city moving in slow motion. Like in the premises of most other attractions in Singapore you could be pestered by photographers who snap your photograph with your family or significant other with or without your permission and try and palm it off to you as you exit . As I walked down the corridor towards the exit I saw my face staring back at me with my family behind me . I did not buy the picture and cared not what they did with my picture but I am sure there are many who would .The experience in the flyer was interesting although expensive but it is a one time show and one can over look it.

Just the usual run of the mill kind that every other hotel in this category offers for the price charged. The hotel's proximity to the airport can be a plus. When we landed late at about 11 PM and tried to contact the hotel for the use of the airport shuttle no one picked the phone up for a long time. After repeated tries we did manage to wake up some one but the instructions offered to locate the shuttle was vague and we took a taxi to avoid further delay.Check in was quite quick and we took two rooms on the 17th floor 1708 and 1710 and found the rooms as comfortable as one could expect. The room was large enough for two adults and one kid in each room. It had all the items mentioned in their promotional literature. The complimentary use of the resident mobile phone in the room was appreciated.The beds were clean and comfortable but the bath room water pressure was poor. Toilets had to be flushed twice very often and the performance of the shower was more like a pot with many leaks. The breakfast spread was exhaustive and good except that the dining hall was always crowded . We had most of our meals in the Wave Cafe because the buffet dinner hall at the Feast @ East was also crowded. The dining hall on floor three is too small for the number of guest sin the hotel The staff at the wave cafe offer personalized service and can serve food even from the other restaurants in the hotel.apart from what they have in their menu. The shopping mall just opposite this hotel has a food court with a wide choice of food available for those who are looking for some variety.The over all experience in this hotel was just about satisfactory .Next time I might want to try another hotel of the same category in order to check the difference

Udipiwala is one such restaurant that serves near authentic South Indian fare. It is however located further away towards Naintal and does not stand out like the others while driving to Naintal. It does stand out while one drives towards Delhi from Naintal.The restaurant specializes in South Indian fare the sambar served here tastes like a clone of sambar served in a North Indian restaurant. This is the one item that really lacks authenticity . All the rest are just about OK . In all fairness this is the only restaurant in this region that serves South Indian food that comes close to the real thing. If you dig South Indian food take a break here.

It is small hotell located away from the hustle and bustle of city noise and traffic. At the same time it is not very far from the International airport - A twenty minute drive at the most- making it an ideal place to make a beeline to after a long and tiring journey. However all the major tourist attractions in and around Kochi are at least an hour's drive away The hotel was practically unoccupied on the day we arrived and were checked in quickly with no delay. It was quite apparant that the staff was manned mainly by trainees straight out of business school and, mind you I am not aagainst trainees, provided of course they have adequate seniors. Despite their sincere and best efforts most of the staff did fall short of efficiency every now and then but their friendliness and helpfulness are straight from the heart.It would be therefore unfair to point out any lapses on this account. Breakfast in the hotel is very basic with limited selection of mostly South Indian variety.Quality and taste was just about satisfactory by South Indian standards.The food in the restaurant was reasonably priced and the quality and taste of the Keralite dishes was superb . The menu did not have many western style grills that I normally go for and so I could not try them .There are no restaurants in the vicinity of this hotel except the road side food joints primarily intended for the locals. The food in these joints can be fantastic provided you can tolerate the spices and the ambiance . Your options for dining out of the hotel restaurant is limited particularly if you have been staying here for more than a few days.The water in the indoor swimming pool and the shower caused my eyes to burn. The water treatment system will require better Ph control . The shower hot and cold water system however was good with adequate pressure and proper temperature control. Most hotels in Kerala fall short in this department.The rooms were large,clean and the AC worked well . The beds were large, soft and comfortable . The entire hotel itself was maintained meticulously clean . The hotel is well suited to people seeking quiet and solitude and also for those who like going our on treks and fishing and the like, There are adequate opportunities for these activities and the hotel provides assistance.

To be specific the hotel building and the grounds are impressive but the stuff inside the hotel, like the furniture,bed, drapes,bathroom plumbing and fittings, hot water system , electrical lighting and the air conditioning system are all old ,out dated and non functional with little or no maintenance . The room too was small We had taken one single and on double room and had problems with hot water, air conditioning and lighting in one or the other or both the rooms . The hotel does have some pros besides the impressive building . The first is the cheerful attitude of the front office manger and the other staff . They were doing their best to keep the guests happy by being cheerful , friendly and trying to be helpful. Not much of a help though with the limited resources available to them.The other asset was their restaurant, which served very good food at reasonable prices. Their buffet was reasonably priced and was quite popular with the locals. Their breakfast too was good although It was not exhaustive . The South Indian fare was very good.The hotel offered complimentary airport pick up and complimentary breakfast along with the rooms at a cost that appeared to be far less than a four star luxury hotel as described. That leaves no room for any grumbles for a one night stay.

This restaurant is an exception .When we entered this hotel there were several vacant tables but the waiters took us to an improvised make shift bench and some stools in a corridor that had no fan or circulating air . The waiter who ambled around said the several empty tables were all reserved tables for tourists. He probably did not know we were tourists ourselves I was in no mood to enlighten him.We considered walking away but we did not for our young kids were hungry and we thought the quality of food may compensate for the shortcomings. Unfortunately it did not, The food took a long time coming and.except for the Sri Lankan fish curry all the food we ordered were inferior in both the taste and quality of cooking. I ordered my favorite seer fish grill and found that they had turned the soft delicate seer fish into a piece of chewy hard tasteless over cooked steak . The final bill was far too exorbitant for the kind of food served and the comfort of the seating in the corridor and an inefficient waiter.at our tableThe restaurant had limited waiters and most of them including the one serving us were busy tending to a bus load of tourist who had occupied the vacant seats .  After we had finished our meal our waiter hovered around us expectantly while my son checked the amount in the billWe had no intention of parting with any tips but on second thoughts realized he was only a small cog in the management of the hotel and made an exception.

The first one from Delhi to Colombo was very good but the return journey was not as good. The third this year was an outright let down and the fourth was the worst. I did notice that the service standard depended on the number of passengers in the cabin and also the direction it was flying. The one from Delhi to Colombo was a few grades higher and service generally good when the plane is not fully loaded.In all fairness I must say the cabin crew were friendly and helpful but when the work load is heavy they are unable to cope up with the pressure. The airlines on its part has packed in as many seats as they could by narrowing the corridor and adding a few more seats even on across the emergency exit doors.Serving of meals was a very slow process and the service wagon blocks the corridor and there was no way any one could walk to the toilets at the end of the corridor. On our last journey the captain switched FASTEN SEAT BELT sign while the food was being served and all service was stopped instantly. I do understand stand air safety is of utmost importance and cannot be compromised. When the service was resumed the crew instead of working faster to make up for the lost time continued with the same pace, Mind you the FASTEN SEAT BELT sign was still on. Of course I don't question the judgement of the captain or the crew. They know their job best. It took more than an hour and a half for the corridor to be cleared and there was a long line of desperate passengers waiting to use the single toilet in the economy section- the other one apparently, was unusable for some reason. All along the head of the cabin crew was urging people to go and sit because the FASTEN SEAT BELT sign was on and it was unsafe to stand. The airline food was as good and or as bad as any other airline The in flight entertainment system requires regular maintenance. On two occasions i noticed the system was defective. What the cabin crew lacked the flight crew made up by being extremely punctual both during take off and landing. IN fact they were quite early on two occasions.The ground staff was very slow .We had checked in on the internet but they refused to allot us the seat we had booked on the net.The management of this airline must seriously look into the operation of their airline if they want to make a mark in the international scene or retain their place in the air line ranking

Buffet lunch was priced at an unbelievable price of around $4.50 and the spread was exhaustive. We have been touring Sri Lankan for the past ten days and found that buffet dinner at almost all similar restaurants we have eaten was never less than $ 15.00 and the spread was always modest.As for the food it was as good as it can ever be. There were three varieties of meat and fish and several varieties of vegetarian food and several desserts as well.This is one of the very few places we found the food to be more than value for money
tjjohn|EA8271F8B12372C87BFE650BE4AD3B56|Hotel|Kalkudah: Giman Free|5| “A desert island ideal for members of the Diogenes club.”|review_396016145|This resort comes pretty close to the definition of a  desert island.  It is located inside a green patch of thick vegetation of trees, and wild bush on a solitary sandy beach some twenty kilometers from the nearest township There was an eerie silence about the place.The front office was just a small building with an open air  reception office  No one seemed to be around but some members of the staff did emerge from the cubbyhole of an office . We like quiet places and decided to try out the resort for one night later later we extended  it to three days and subsequently booked it yet again for another three days for the following week. The resort is managed by a hand full staff  and the number of guests were also a handful.Every one  kept to themselves going about doing what they wanted with the barest minimum of  interaction with any one else.The only sounds we heard  were the lashing of waves, the whistle of the wind  , the chatter of the birds and buzzing of bees and mosquitoes .  Apart from the sound of a solitary motor boat once in a long while there was very little  man made noise in the resort. We lived like the Swiss family Robinson. Spent most of our time swimming in the lonely sea all by ourselves  ,  walked around the resort grounds all by ourselves. and ate in the dining hall all by ourselves .  The other guests also kept to themselves. occasionally solitary couples could be seen basking in the sun on isolated  places in and around the complex.The  staff members  who were exceptionally friendly and helpful kept to themselves as well and followed a policy of speak when spoken to. A variety of creeping crawling reptiles had the run of the resort. They seldom put an appearance but their trails on the soft sand gave their presence away . Food was good in the restaurant but turned monotonous after a few meals.  There are no other restaurant any where close by so we drove over to Passikudah every now and then for a meal.We had our taxi with us and so transportation  was not a problem. We shopped for provisions such as  fruits, biscuits and the like to supplement the breakfast provided by the restaurant.   We even bought fresh fish from the market and the kitchen staff was  happy to grill it for us.As for the cottages the management has been generous with their investment. The double room we had was large and had one double bed and one single bed at no extra cost. The bathroom too was much larger than necessary and it had all the necessary toiletries  The AC was just about OK but the water pressure in the shower was low . The TV had limited programs but it had the channels  our kids wanted. The cottages can be said to be an unexpected  luxury in a desert Island. The over all atmosphere in the complex reminded one of the fictional Diogenes club. Some useful tips.1. If you enjoy solitude and silence far away from human habitation then this is the place for you.2.The sea is shallow and not very rough .Swimming even for kids can be safe but large amount of sea weeds  keeps swirling around often getting entangled on the body .3. Food can be monotonous in the long run and the cost of tuk tuk or a taxi to Passikudah and back could work out prohibitively expensive.4.The staff here is quite friendly and helpful and they could get you fresh fish and or fruits for you if you ask them to.5. Try the motor boat ride around the area for a view of the resort and a close look at the reef around the resort. 6. If you are a diver with a penchant to explore sunken ship wrecks this resort could be a base for you. There are several ship wrecks in this area. Notable among them is the world war II  British aircraft carrier the HMS Hermes sunk by the Japanese in 1942

The buffet spread was not exhaustive nor were the food quality in keeping with the Rs 4000 / meal they charged for foreigners. There was nothing special about their restaurant but the view of the sea and vast sandy beach was a great compensation.

The double room we got was very good , very clean and spacious with a sea view past the dining area. and the pool. The beds were comfortable and the AC was perfect. The bath room was large and clean. and the swimming pool was large with clean sparkling water and inviting. All the food in this hotel including the breakfast was made to order.They were all good and tasty. and served elegantly.The management however has overlooked some important safety issue that can turn our to be hazardous . This hotel in other respects deserves five but I give four stars for this reason.The hot and cold water system with two set of taps one set for the over head shower and the other for the hand shower is unsafe. The mixing of hot and water is uncontrolled and unregulated.. This is dangerous for any one under the shower or using the hand shower who can get sever burns if the hot water valve is opened without opening the cold water valve. This happened to two of our our family members in the two rooms we had taken. Fortunately the person concerned was practical enough to check the water temperature before getting under the shower. The hot and water mixing controls in this hotel needs proper control system for safe usage.The dining area is built around the large swimming pool on the same level as the dining area floor level. There is nothing to prevent any one walking around the dining area from stumbling in to the swimming pool due to error of judgement . A simple railing around the swimming pool would have made this area safe from such a calamity.It is unfortunate that the management has not applied its mind to these essential measures to ensure the safety of their guests.Not withstanding these safety issues this hotel is a good place for holiday makers and othersSome tips .1. Make sure to check the the cold and water from the shower before using the showers. Open the cold water tap first and then open the hot water tap to get a mixture to the required temperature.2. Mind your steps while walking in the dining area particularly during the evenings when the lightning is subdues here.

Our driver however cautioned us that the trip to Sigiriya could be arduous for me and wife who were in our mid seventies. After collating bits and pieces of information from the various website on Sigiriya it was quite clear this trip would have been great for us some ten years earlier. The hazards of a visit - more a trek - to Sigiriya is seldom mentioned in sites that extol the tourist value of Sigiriya. We had to scuttle the tour but we did pass by it and wondered what we had missed.Tips for intending visitors. Read as much as you can on Sigiriya and decide whether you can make it before going for this trip.

There are dozens of restaurants littered around Sana and all these restaurants - often housed in ramshackle buildings - are  located close to high and low end resorts  targeting the tourists in these resorts. Sana is is no exception . It is located close to some of the most expensive high  end resorts in Trincomalee  and churns out food not very different from the ones in its neighborhood.  Thanks to outdated and inappropriate TA rating system it has been chosen as one of the 10 best restaurants in Trincomalee .Our lunch experience at Sana was trying for they hardly had what we wanted from their menu. We had to make do with what they had at hand.What they had at hand was limited and it looked like food prepared from left over raw materials.The curd ordered by my vegetarian wife was sour to the extent it could not be consumed. My favorite seer fish was not available; instead I had to chose between tuna and Mullet for my grill. Nothing special about the much extolled curries here, just run of the mill stuff  that one can get any where in Sri Lanka. I give this two stars because their claims are misleading. They did not have many of what is listed in their menu .  They were obviously geared for business for dinner in the evening but they claim they serve  breakfast lunch and dinner . Tips to readers.1. Ignore TA ratings. Go by your own intuition when you walk  past a restaurant. 2. All  the  restaurants advertising seafood here do serve fresh fish. Ask to inspect the fish or crab or lobster before ordering a grill or fry.The owners will be happy to show them to you3. All these restaurants suffer from inconsistency in service and quality of food served and so keep your expectation low even if you had previous meals in the same place.4. If you are genuinely interested in tasting authentic Sri Lankan food ask a tuk tuk driver to you take you to a restaurant where he himself eats. He might refuse at first  but with a bit of persuasion he would  take you there . It would be no place for a tourist but it would be some place serving  some food. Don't look too critically at the dining area of fellow diners but do mind the spices.

There are several other resorts in this area but the beach in this area is not crowded as in other places like Trincomalee.We were looking for a clean uncrowded beach that was safe for the kids to swim and we found this resort ideal . The resort has a large swimming pool and a playground for kids to play as well.Most rooms do not have a sea view.The rooms we got did not have one but was spacious and clean . The bathroom was basic but clean and satisfactory.The shower pressure was low and the hot water system just about adequate. The AC in the room was quite effective The room had a TV that had very limited programs. The room also had a coffee making machine with the essential consumables. Food in the restaurant was as good as several other resorts of this kind. Nothing special but just monotonous and nothing to write home about.The buffet breakfast spread had all the basic breakfast items plus some Sri Lankan local food. Again not very different from many resorts of this kind.The dining hall was small and was always crowded due to shortage of tables. We had spent most of our time swimming in the sea as well as in the swimming pool and thoroughly enjoyed it. Because we had a car at our disposal we went out for lunch but had our dinner in the resort. Several seafood restaurants operating from makeshift buildings may be found some fifteen kilometers away in Trincolamee. Such seafood restaurants have not found their way in this region but I reckon they eventually will to target the residents in the resorts in this region. Activities like snorkeling, diving and or cruising to Pigeon island - just a ten minute ride - are available here in this resort as is in other resorts but these can be unreasonably expensive for foreigners.Room Tips,1. Ask for rooms in the ground floor.In the first floor rooms the Ac can not only be less efficient on a hot day but also the water pressure can be low in the bath room.2.If you are a foodie then you may not have much of a choice with regard to food.. You will have to be satisfied with what is offered in the restaurant . The nearest place to go for meals will be ten to fifteen kilometers away. 3. If you love solitude and are looking for a quiet holiday and not bother about your meals then this may be an ideal place for you..4. The beach and the sea are the major plus in this resort

There is nothing Sinhalese about this temple it is out and out a chip splintered from the temple culture of Tamil Nadu. If there are differences I cannot spot them for I am no temple expert. I did not enter the temple because it was necessary to remove one's shoes and I was in no mood to walk barefoot on a hot day on a dirty pathway. The temple was located high on a mountain peak and the view of the sea was panoramic and brought in a mood of peace and well being all around. The shops on the path leading to the temple sell all kinds of items used in Hindu religious rituals. This may be one of the best places to buy souvenir for yourselves and gifts for your Hindu friends.

We opted for the deluxe rooms on the first floor of their new building . The beach cottages facing the sea and the standard rooms on the next row were inferior in quality and maintenance.The double room my wife and I got was spacious with an effective AC and a balcony that had a view of the sea past palm trees and the swimming pool. The room had a tea/coffee maker and a TV set . It also had a writing table with chairs.  The bath room was large but basic in other respects. The water pressure was low and just enough to have a insipid shower.Even the toilet cistern took unusually long time to refill .The long sandy beach was the best feature in this hotel. We stayed here for three nights and the sea was quite docile on all these days letting us swim in the shallow waters without discomfort. The swimming pool was small compared to the size of the resort and can be crowded at times.The restaurant was small and crowded at breakfast time but the breakfast spread was quite exhaustive offering a wide range of food , including Sri Lankan and Indian varieties. The managers and the Chef went round greeting the dining guests to check whether all was satisfactory. We ate our dinner here one evening but it was not both expensive and below par compared to the street side restaurants in the neighborhood.The hotel staff was friendly and helpful .They were quick to attend to complaints and resolving problems.Some useful tips.1. Go for the 1st. floor deluxe rooms . This is the optimum place for reasonable water pressure and view of the sea. It is also much better maintained and spacious.2.The rooms do not have safety lockers. Keep your valuables in the front office safety lockers.3. The shallow sea is safe for swimmers when the sea is not rough.

The management appeared to be over joyed to see us enter t heir hotel and went out of their way to receive us with welcome drinks and carried out a candle lighting ritual . On our second visit we were treated as royals for patronizing their hotel and I must say it was quite a overwhelming welcome.On out first visit my wife and I had a double room on the second floor while my son had a single room in the same floor. However on our second visit we were offered a suite that had a family room and a double room on the ground floor . This was specifically offered because I had requested a room with a shower instead of a bath tub.The rooms in this hotel are spacious and spotlessly clean with an an effective AC. The TV in the room was good.The bathroom was superb in every respect and they had stocked it with a variety of freebies and toiletries. The hot and cold water showers had satisfactory pressure and flow, however I found the bath tub to be unusually high. People with knee problems could find it difficult to get in. Incidentally my son and my wife did have knee problems. The bathroom is see through under certain lighting conditions. Not that it mattered to us but it could be an issue with some guests. The management in view of this were kind enough to offer us 106 and 107 on our second visit. Room 106 has a shower area as well as a bath tub. This room combination also has a common family lounge with a work table . This would be one of the best option for families and groups.The hotel has no lift but the staircase has a very low gradient with solid handrails. Although a bit inconvenient it was definitely not a major issue My wife and I are in our mid seventies and we had no problem negotiating the staircase.Tourmaline has another unit named Topaz located a few hundreds feet away at a higher level . Depending on the guest occupancy, buffet meals are served on either or both of them . On our first visit Tourmaline served us buffet breakfast as well as buffet dinner. Both these meals had an excellent spread and the quality of food was superb. However on our second visit we had to go up to the other hotel for our buffet dinner. Both the variety offered and the quality of food and service in Topaz was a few grades lower than Tourmaline. The swimming pool located between these two units is common to both units. It was large and inviting. The twin hotel complex is locate on one of the peaks in this mountain region. The view from both units were great .Friendliness and helpfulness of staff members of the hospitality industry in Sri Lanka is more a rule than an exception and but the front office staff in Tourmaline went the extra mile to make our stay memorable in their hotel. Despite having a GPS navigation system with us we had some difficulty getting into and out of this hotel complex. The management would do well to install proper signboards at intersections .

The toilets are not only primitive but you need to pay one of the highest rates in the world to use it.

As usual I find that TA ratings are assessment of popularity and not necessarily quality. The restaurant has a good range of food options but quality of food and taste was not very different from several other restaurants in this area.However the cost was comparatively higher.Service was slow and ambiance nothing to write home about. Located beside the main road it was noisy and the loud music only made it worse. Not a place where one might want to dine fine food in comfortable surroundings. Give this place a try if you are curious to know what it is all about.

The lodge had a decent kitchen with friendly and welcoming staff . The final clincher however was the price tag. I had taken a double room for four days and a family room for two days for my son and his family . We found the rooms clean and just large enough with basic beds that cannot be said to be uncomfortable. The bathroom in my room was elegantly done up with snow white tiles and matching fittings accentuating the cleanliness of the place. One would expect the efficiency of the water pressure of the shower and hot water system to be in keeping with the elegance of this bathroom but that was not the case. They were good enough for a shower or a wash. The towels and toiletries provided were all basic. The room had a wardrobe,TV and a small writing table with a chair .What needs to be appreciated most is the obsession of the management to keep the entire hotel and the surroundings as clean as possible. They meticulously clean the beach up every day on a continues basis although the beach is not their private property . They also clean up the entire hotel except the rooms which are cleaned once in two days although they did clean ours on special request the first day.  The atmosphere inside the rooms and the bathroom had a stale damp smell when we entered the room. This is understandable in a beach front hotel room that also has an AC fitted in it. The room obviously needs to be sealed for effective cooling. To clear the foul air we opened the large window and the front door to let in gusts of strong cold wind straight from the ocean to flush the room. The change in the room atmosphere was instant and dramatic.  I am not sure, but I think the friendly Mr. Tissa , the manager of this hotel , who watched our move looked a bit uncomfortable with this procedure. Thankfully he did not object. The air conditioners in the rooms did  have some performance issues in the night. We were not bothered about their performance in the day. The technician who attended to our complaint tried to cool the condenser coils with bottles of water.I think these issues can  easily be set right by the management by relocating the condenser coils of the ACs in a better ventilated area than the present closed enclosure over the dining area. - I should know for I am an engineer with over five decades of experience in this field.  The break fast provided with room cost was basic but they are happy to provide add - ons at extra cost. Fair enough. The food including Sri Lankan food served in this restaurant is as good and as expensive as any other in the neighborhood restaurants. Must remember they all target foreign tourists in general and Western futurists in particular.     Some Helpful tips. 1. The double room No.4 and No.5 we occupied was the best in this hotel with a great sea view.2. The hotel does not have a swimming pool and swimming in the sea can be hazardous depending on the season and condition of the sea .3. This hotel offers a clean and open beach and would be particularly appealing to people who love to spend all their time out doors. 4. The neighborhood is littered with restaurants of all cuisines . If you are a foodie you would love this place5. The restaurant in this hotel serves a variety of food including Sri Lanka curries and seafood. Of particular appeal to me was seer fish - not tuna - grilled and or crumb fried with steamed vegetables.6 If you are looking for luxury at a bargain price, please give this place a miss and save yourself the grumbles.

The bathroom however was a major let down. The shower cubicle positioned inside the bathroom in the most unimaginative way brings down the rating of this excellent hotel. The owners must not be satisfied with the high rating they already have but must press into service some professionals to re work on the bathroom to a more aesthetic level.We had taken one double room for me and my wife and a single room for my son. The rooms were spotlessly clean and spacious. In fact the entire hotel is spacious and kept spotlessly clean. Air conditioners were just about adequate for the rooms and the bed just about comfortable. The hotel is located in a quiet area and is not on the sea front although the sea and the beaches are indeed visible and offer a reasonably good view.Breakfast was basic although they did try to get us some Sri Lankan stuff. The staff members were extremely friendly and helpful. It would be absurd to expect great luxury at the price one pays for the rooms here but it is definitely excellent value for money.General observation and tips. 1.This hotel is not a beach front hotel. The beach is a bit away from the hotel although one could have a clear view of the sea and the beach from some rooms.2. This region is generally unsuitable for swimming in the sea. Even the beach was dirty during the period of our stay. 3. We could not see the usual sea food restaurants one normally gets to see near such hotels. The hotel is isolated and away from the main market area . However food in the hotel was as good as any other place and reasonably priced as well.

We took a local bus and reached the harbour after an interesting ride through the township of ChimeseeWe bought a round trip ticket for the family and took the cruise and spent the whole day exploring the island ports the ships docked. The first stop was Herreninsel also know as men's island. The cruise duration was not more than fifteen minutes. After dropping us, the ship sailed off to the next island. Tourists could see all the attractions in the island and then take the next ship that comes by.The main attraction in this island is King Ludwig II 's palace some twenty minutes walk away from the harbor. There is a shop next to the ticket counter and a restaurant. We found both of them closed The next ship came around after about an hour and this time we sailed to Frauenchiemsee also known as Fraueninsel or Women's island, The monastery here is over a thousand years old and heaped in history, A meal in the 500 years Klosterwirt restaurant just opposite the jetty can be a memorable experience.Make sure to be in time and return by the last ship back to the starting point. You could be stranded for the night if you did not.

In the 1985 movie, 'The Scarlet and the Black', which is based on true events this drawing of the line by German soldiers is shown. Of course this line is not there any more but some kind of demarcation does exist and one. The Vatican city is home and workplace to the Holy pope and his religious followers like fathers,mothers,sisters and brothers but it is also home and work place to criminals like pick pockets and cheats. It is important to keep that fact in mnind

By just leaning and not falling off - till now, that is - it has appropriated a good proportion of tourists who might otherwise be looking at other monuments with more to offer in Pisa.An old friend of mine who happens to be a resident of Pisa commented that this bell tower was not the only that leaned in Pisa. He show me several boundary walls some distance away that were leaning . The ground here is unevenly hard and soft that causes building and structures to lean and many do fall down in course of time without much of a ceremony. It will be a world event when this one falls and I strongly recommend that one see this tower while it is still standing
tjjohn|EA8271F8B12372C87BFE650BE4AD3B56|Attractions|Vatican City: St. Peter's Square (Piazza San Pietro)|5| “A square packed with history and pickpockets”|review_336629216|The Pope's words are God's words for every Catholic and here is where one may see and hear the pope Every a time new pope is elected this is the place where the world gets to know the new Pope the first time.Remember this has been going on since the first papal conclave some time in 1456 AD.When the Nazis took over Rome during the second world war this again was a center of drama between the Nazis and the then neutral Vatican. The 1985 classic "The Scarlet and the Black" based on true events vividly depicts some of the events that took place in and around St.Peter's square during that period.St.Peter's Square is one of the the center stages where history often unfolds. On the darker side St.Peters Square is also a place where you can get your pocket picked. Make sure you are alert when you walk around the square including the Sistine chapel. I always carry two wallets. One for the thief and the other for myself.I keep a few small change for the thief and keep his wallet prominently in my trouser pocket. My money, I keep inside a secret pocket under my belt. That way the thief get his legitimate share for his efforts and I keep my hard earned stuff.I recommend this to one and all you go around Vatican city and St.Peter's square.

Entry here is free but make sure you visit this first before you visit the Vatican Museum to avoid the crowds.
tjjohn|EA8271F8B12372C87BFE650BE4AD3B56|Attractions|Vatican City: Sistine Chapel|5| “The man behind the paintings gets five points.”|review_335418763|It took four long years to paint these masterpieces for Michelangelo Buonarroti, The run of the mill tourist hardly stays here for more than a few minutes. It is just a passing splash of paint and figures on a low light ceiling and walls for the majority of people who come here including me. I am not an admirer of the church or their activities and am most certainly not a believer although I have read the holy Bible in detail and do know that the themes depicted are all from the holy Bible and they mean little or nothing to me.What did flash through my atheistic mind during the brief period I was inside the chapel was the image of an inspired human being who had the inclination and the courage to work on such a laborious project. A project that has drawn millions of people around the world for ages , a project that will continue to draw many more millions in the future.My five for Michelangelo Buonarroti
tjjohn|EA8271F8B12372C87BFE650BE4AD3B56|Attractions|Vatican City: Vatican Museums|3| “Great Collection,Great works of art but a waste of time”|review_335122379|There are three reasons why you would want to see this place.1. You are a devout catholic and strongly feel what ever is inside the Vatican must be seen.2. You are a scholar ,or a connoisseur of art .history or culture and already know a lot more about what is inside. 3 You are an ordinary tourist and don't want to be known as someone who has missed seeing an important place in Rome.We were ordinary tourists and went for the third reason - speaking for myself - I don't think I will ever visit this place again. Mind you I am no Philistine and I can appreciate art ,music and culture as well as any cultured person .I honestly think the collection of sculptures and paintings are unique works that represents European culture over the ages. However walking corridor after corridor for over three hours looking at the exhibits and listening to facts and figures by the tour guide was monotonous and trying. By the time we reached the famous Sistine Chapel we were fagged out and were thankful it was all over. That feeling is not indicative of a memorable experience.Coming from India we are used to huge crowds and being herded like cattle in a closed space is not unusual for us. When we go sightseeing in India we make it a point never to go on high season and avoid crowds whenever possible.That luxury of a preferred time was not available here . We were in Rome for a limited period of time,so we landed here at opening time on a November morning. There was a long line of people at the ticket counter and the line did not appear to be moving. A smart young man came over and gave us an aggressive sales talk of why we should buy one of his private conducted tours of the museum. He was not very different from the scores of touts one finds in Indian tour sites and we wondered whether it was wise to trust himHe was quite persuasive and looked honest . The idea that we could save time by joining the conducted tour and enter the museum through a side door was tempting. The cost quoted was much higher than the standard entry fee. We were an Indian family of six and we tried to bargain with him Indian style . After some haggling we did manage to get some kind of discount when he found out we were serious. We were reluctant to hand him any cash but he did not want any. He took us to his office across the road and we got our tickets. I must say this option though a bit expensive saved the day.If you belong to the first two categories then my tips below will be of no use to you. However if you are an ordinary run of the mill tourist like me then some of the tips may be useful.1. If you have limited time in Rome just ignore this museum and restrict your visit to the St.Peters square and St.Peter's Basilica. They are great sights and a must see in Vatican. Most people go the museum first and the go to the Basilica afterwards. Entry is free and if you go there skipping the museum you would probably don't have to wait in a line.2. If you must visit the museum and if you haven't booked your tickets in advance then try the touts but check he or she is genuine by walking over to their office to get the tickets. I would not recommend buying roadside tickets here.3. The tour conductor is responsible for the radio sets given to each tourist and he/she would ask for some kind of security like a credit card or driving license etc. for the set. The radio is not worth walking away with but you can keep an identity card of yours for this purpose.

It is a treat to all mountain lovers and other as well.We went to Zugspitze from Munich in the month of November. Not the best time of the year for tourism here.Surprisingly it was unusually warm and pleasant. The kids were looking forward to play in the snow and they were not disappointed. Panoramic views of snow clad mountains, mountains lakes snow and heights above 2600 meters are not unfamiliar to us for we have a house in a small the Himalayan township in India but for an engineer like the experience of going up in a cog wheel train and ascending and descending in steep cable cars was thrilling. Zugspitze can be visited through tour operators who conduct package tours from Munich however in November it was off season and there were no tour packages available so we made it on our own. The tips below may be useful to those who plan to go to Zugsptize on their own.The official German railway company, Deutsche Bahn - DB ) - does not operate trains to Zugspitze. In fact they do not have any information on trains to Zugspitze.The Zugspitze train is operated by another company known as the Bayerische Zugsptize Bahn and it operates from Gramisch-Partenkirchen.One could buy a ticket at Munich from a DB ticket counter to Gramisch-Partenkirchen . Here you will have to disembark and change platforms to take the Bayerische Zugspitze bahn to Zugspitze. The Bayerische Zugsptize Bahn is a separate company and it will be necessary to buy their ticket at their counter.The ticket counters of DB and Zugspitze Bahn are not in the same building. DB is at one end of the station and the ZB is at the opposite end. We bought a round trip to Zugspitze from Gramisch-Partenkirchen. This ticket is valid for travel by the cog wheel train as well as the cable cars. Cog wheel trains start from Gramisch-Partenkirchen and go right up to Zugspitze Platt via Eibsee - a station at which one may get off to see the lake in the region and then re board the train or take a cable car directly to Zugspitze. Zufspitze platt is the place where most people spend lot of time having fun and or eating or drinking in the restaurant here. Kids play here in the snow . Zugspitze, the actual peak or highest point in Germany is a short cable car ride away away from Zugspitz PlattFrom Zugspitze you can either return the same way you went up and take the cog wheel train back to Gramisch-Partenkirchen or take a cable car from Zugspitze to Eibsee. From Eibsee you could travel the very short distance by the cogwheel train back to Garmisch Partenkirchen . As mentioned above one could also go to Zugspitze from Eibsee by cable car and avoid the ascent by train.Eibsee is between Gramisch-Partenkirchen and Zugspitze platt and the cable car saves a lot of time on your return journey. We went right up to Zugspitz platt up by the cogwheel train and spent a few hours there and then took the cable car to Zugspitze and after some more time looking at the panoramic view took the cable car back to Eibsee and then took the train to Garmisch Partenkirchen and from thereon to Munich.

We were not disappointed! The entrees were sensational especially the Chive Cakes, the Dried Prawns with Ginger and Coconut in Betel Leaves, and the Crunchy Prawns. Of the mains we loved the Siamese Watercress, and the Soft Shell Crab with Black Pepper, Chilli and Coriander was divine.There was even room for dessert....the Durian ice-cream with Sesame Wafer was a revelation, and the Banana Roti was delish!Service was polite, but needs to be more informative especially re wine matching.Price is not cheap but typical of where you are in the heart of the CBD.

The staff are genuinely friendly and ever so helpful and patient with orders, but.......The food is really very average. The Caesar salad featured a refrigerated poached egg, and the additional prawns were like little frozen ones! The fish dishes were basically oily battered slabs. The one meat dish sampled was ok. To be honest, most pub food these days would run rings around this place.Other writers mention the wine is well priced...perhaps so, but this list is so lacking in quality wines that I had a beer instead!This place has so much potential but I think it mainly caters to retirement homes for a day out, and those oldies deserve better!!

You can also walk tracks if you have time which we didn't do due to tiring children!PS taxi back to Novena was just over $20....a bit more to downtown.

This is more like a hotel with apartment like facilities (e.g. laundry) but with hotel supportive staff. All staff go out of their way to support you. We loved our week there.You would be hard pressed to find a better hotel/apartment in Singapore. Breakfast was provided and quite hearty. Pool and gym were utilised. A handy phone is available free.The MRT is 7 minutes away. Novena is not downtown Singapore but a quieter area only 20 minutes away by train. It is very close to Newton for hawker food (1 stop away), Little India is just over a KM, and there are plenty of great cafes in Novena itself.A taxi to Changi airport is 20 minutes and approx $20. You can MRT it but it is a lot longer.It is also much closer to Singapore Zoo than downtown hotels. Our only complaint....for some reason there is no breakfast on Sundays. We walked up the street to Clueless Goat and had a superlative breakfast at even better prices (meals under $10 a head.)Overall, a fabulous extended stay with family in Singapore.

Personally, I would have preferred a finer pasta as the crab flavours are so delicate. Pizzas are strengths here, especially the prawn and prosciutto.

Communication was clear and prompt, payment was easy online and it just worked seamlessly.The highlight was 3 nights on Inle Lake at Inle Princess Resort. It was just magic. We didn't want it to end! I can see why Mick Jagger stayed here.There are lots of cruises on offer in Myanmar which just go up the river from Yangon to Mandalay. These are more expensive than a personalised tour like the one we just did. Our advice, experience Myanmar over two weeks with Buffalo.PS the internal flights were fine....the aircraft were small French turbo prop ATR's.

Let me say first that the refurbishment is beautiful as you would expect, but service is downright poor. Hopefully, this will improve rapidly because at this stage I could not recommend it. First, the drinks from the bar order took ages to arrive then was missing one altogether, (PS smoking is allowed at the bar!), our meals arrived at different times, and our drink order with our meal never arrived at all even after several requests. We did complain and had our earlier bar bill removed but for an establishment of this calibre it is just not acceptable.We didn't bother staying for dessert or coffee after that.The meals.....they were fine but for the prices asked they were not outstanding.

It was the perfect place to cool off with a Myanmar beer and some delightful curries and salads.Lovely old building with high ceilings and air conditioning. Not expensive.

It's not really a dedicated tea house but a fabulous cafe serving tea, coffee and delicious modern Myanmar food. We liked it so much we went back 3 times!Try the pork bao, the Mohinga soup, the pennywort salad, duck empanadas and you will see what we mean. It's easy to find in central Yangon and it's not expensive.

After driving through Bagan you suddenly come across this oasis! It is a feast for the eyes with a setting in the middle of fields of Pagodas and stupas.Rooms are cavernous, wifi was good and free, breakfasts were a delight, and the pool has to be seen to be believed.Meals at the restaurant were of good quality. The setting for it is beautiful. It is probably a lot easier eating here than having to get into the township.There is an ATM onsite and power points in rooms are of the multi type...great idea.Hard to think of a better base to view the wonders nearby.

It is very well maintained and all staff were very welcoming. Wifi was good and free, breakfasts were fine without being exceptional, and there is a large pool.The hotel is not in the main centre of Mandalay but is fine for those who are happy to get a taxi to the various attractions. There is an Asian restaurant upstairs with good food but indifferent service.Overall a solid 4 stars.

Absolutely beautiful with lots of tourists as you would expect. Go half an hour before sunset and stay an hour. A highlight.PS check out the information boards there to see the amount of precious jewels in the 'umbrella'.

Rooms are spotless and good size with older style but beautifully maintained bathrooms (shower in bath). Wifi was free and quite fast. Breakfasts were a highlight ......loved the prawn and chicken dumplings, noodle soups to order, egg station, Bircher muesli and custard tarts.With wonderful staff, a beautiful pool, and close (30 minute walk) to all the crumbling historic centre has to offer, what more could you want?Two quick points.....great security with all luggage scanned on entry, and Power outlets are both English and Euro....very handy.Definitely recommended.

The views early morning or late afternoon are just gorgeous. It's an easy walk to Tamarama then onto Bronte....you can go further to Coogee if you wish or have the time. There are so many photo ops that the walk will take twice as long as expected. Watch out for the super fit Bondians who run past you not admiring the beauty to behold.Bronte has lots of coffee pitstops for those in need of sustenance. PS why not stop at Icebergs on the way back for a drink and dessert?? Cheaper than a whole meal here!

Tried the Pea Pancake after another TA review and what a choice! Brilliant! Who would think peas, pancakes, feta and avocado could be friends together?Coffee was super too......what's not to like?Hint...... Big queues on weekends so go weekdays instead.

Can you really beat the location, the no frills, pared down menu and superb wine list?We were there for lunch and could not have been happier. The charred prawns and Barramundi were lick the bowl good.Great to see excellent local wines by the glass eg Keith Tulloch 2015 Semillon at reasonable prices ($10)Staff were friendly, knowledgeable and plain delightful.Can't wait to come back.Ps save space for the two person size Tarte Tatin.

Service was prompt and courteous, juices were not up to some other local cafes, scrambled eggs were delightfully creamy, while ricotta pancakes were a bit bland. Maybe our expectations were too high, maybe in Bondi they are being outgunned?Glad we went but slightly underwhelmed.

We loved the quirky rooms with king size beds, Art Deco bathrooms and good size balcony. There were no great beach views but it's just across the road.Our room even had a small kitchenette with coffee pod machine and dishwasher..... Great if you want to eat in. There's a great supermarket on the ground floor.Staff were super helpful and had great advice on where to eat. NB there is no restaurant or breakfast available but this is a good point.... There are so many great breakfast and dinner options within a block. Loved Porch and Parlour for breakfast and North Bondi Fish for lunch.There is no pool and Valet parking is expensive....but hey, you're in Bondi!Would love to return again soon.
moonflower59|2F8B3B9C614B255583F1103983C5D16F|Restaurant|Sydney: Mercado|5| “Top Tapas”|review_410889631|Spanish is in right now and after eating at Mercado you can see why. There were no disappointments with food or wine, in fact the standards of all meals served were very high. Picking highlights is hard but the Ortiz anchovies on bull peppers was just delicious and the small plate dish of duck pastilla was a revelation.....such a good choice to go with the Mencia wine.What's not to like in this piece of Madrid in the heart of Sydney?

Everywhere stops for lunch around 3 and recommences for dinner around 5-5.30 so what to do for a 4pm light meal before undertaking a Coonawarra wine tasting at Ivy from 5-8?The answer is Ash St Cellar.....it's right beside Ivy and is open all afternoon. Perfect!The four meals all hit the spot.....not to heavy. There was lamb cutlets with Tzatziki, some small school prawns, and a truffles and cheese toasty. Coffee was good and some excellent Kosciusko beer on tap.Service was ok.....not as bad as some other other reviews!Hard to beat at this time slot.

Having been to other great walks such as Berry and Berrima it was a disappointment. So busy, so many people and so tacky. Where are all the quality local handicrafts, locally grown coffee and local produce? It's all crystals and soap and fudge and gaudy clothes.

Only issues were breakfast....toast and tea are fine but could be so much better for a small increase in cost. Wifi was free but so slow.....only minor niggles for such a great stay.

Quite reasonable if you are on a short stay and want the comfort as well as the party atmosphere. Dont stay here if noise bothers you. Also, as an added bonus the Tsunami refuge centre is just beside it, incase.

I did not expect any of this even though I have received good feedback from friends. It is a sort of place where you could keep yourselves busy through activities, play badminton, tennis, rent a bicycle, fooseball, table tennis, day long SPA, dip in the Jacuzzi, it even has a play area for kids, a perfect place for a corporate, family, or even a romantic couple trip. You dont ever feel the need to get out. It is so serene and natural. The best part of my trip were the staffs. Excellent how they anticipate your needs. How they are serving you with a smile and making sure your fine... where ever you are. They never seemed to irritate you. Very smart and friendly crew. I would go back there again. I would suggest everyone to go there and spend at least 3-5 nights just within the Resort. I would expect the management to sustain their service and even continuously improve.
